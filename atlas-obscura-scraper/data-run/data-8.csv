0,Ash Jesus and Ash Buddha,Macau,Sculptures of religious figures made from the ashes of pilgrims' incense.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ash-jesus,"Using the resurrected ashes from temple incense in Shanghai, Chinese artist Zhang Huan created the torsos of two of the most prominent religious figures in the world. Standing over 8 feet tall, Ash Jesus and Ash Buddha were recently displayed in Macau. In a kind of religious showdown, the figures were installed facing each other; Jesus with hands outstretched, and Buddha sitting cross-legged, the perfect embodiment of tranquility. These massive sculptures are two of many impressive works of art by Huan that incorporate the ashes of incense carried by pilgrims. Using steel, and wood as a frame, the sculptures were layered in ash, giving them a deathly and eerie look and adding further complexity and symbolism. Huan hoped the figures would show similarities between the Eastern and Western religions, and the two ash deities were shown in as a part of a larger exhibition entitled “East Wind, West Wind.”  This exhibit was a temporary exhibit sponsored by Louis Vuitton at their Flagship store at One Central Mall, NAPE, Macau. - The exhibition ran from April to June 2011 in their special art exhibit, ESpace. As such this temporary exhibit is no longer available in Macau"
1,Old Protestant Cemetery,Macau,The final resting place of 19th-century sailors previously banned from being buried within Portuguese Macau.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-protestant-cemetery,"Macau, a small peninsula southwest of Hong Kong, is mainly known for its flashy casinos. Dig a bit deeper, and you’ll find a trove of historical treasures hiding among the luxurious hotels and glitzy attractions. For several hundred years, Macau was a colony of Portugal, which left behind distinctive historical and cultural sites. But the Old Protestant Cemetery is unique among Macau’s graveyards, as most of those interred there are neither Portuguese nor Chinese. The Portuguese colonists viewed the peninsula as sacred Roman Catholic ground. As such, they prohibited any Protestants from being buried within the city limits. And on the outside of the city walls, the Chinese refused to allow any foreigners to be laid to rest within the land. This left Protestant sailors and merchants—many from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Northern Europe—in a tough situation. They were forced to bury their dead secretly at night, risking dangerous confrontations with the Chinese officials and left to do nothing but hope that the unsanctioned graves they dug wouldn’t be defaced or destroyed as punishment. In 1821, the non-Catholic, non-local merchants finally gained access to their own burial grounds, thanks to the British East India Company’s decision to buy a plot of land to use as a graveyard. People originally buried outside the city limits were exhumed and reburied at the cemetery. By 1858, the graveyard had already filled. The cemetery closed and a new one was opened, earning this one the title of the Old Protestant Cemetery. You’ll find some interesting graves within the cemetery, including those of the artist George Chinnery and missionary Robert Morrison. You’ll also spot the resting places of many fascinating seamen, including a cabin boy who died of “a fall into the hold.” Keep a particular eye out for the grave that says “Secret to the memory” instead of “Sacred to the memory.”  The cemetery is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. It's located just off the entrance to the lovely Luis de Camões Park, which is also well worth a visit."
2,Taipa Houses,"Taipa, Macau",These pastel-colored homes were built when the island of Macau was a Portuguese colony.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taipa-houses,"These Portuguese-style homes show a different Macau, far from the lights of casinos. The Taipa Houses were built in 1921, to serve as the residences of senior civil servants when the island was a colony of Portugal. (Macau was a Portuguese colony from 1557 until 1999, when the rule was transferred to the People’s Republic of China.) In 1992, the regional government renovated the houses and turned them into a museum. In 2016, the houses became home to the Macanese Living Museum, which includes artistic and cultural artifacts as well as recreations of what these houses looked like when they were initially built."
3,Batu Caves,"Batu Caves, Malaysia","Holy Hindu shrine in an enormous, monkey-filled limestone cavern.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/batu-caves,"During Thaipusam, an annual celebration of the triumph of good over evil, hundreds of thousands of spiritual pilgrims climb the 272 stairs up into the Batu Caves carrying kavadis, symbolic burdens which include elaborate body piercings. This is the Malaysian version of a Hindu festival celebrated among the Tamil community in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Thaipusam comes from the junction of two words, the Tamil month called “Thai” and a star, named “Pusam.” Observed each year in January or February according to the Tamil calendar, the festival of Thaipusam honors the Hindu god Murugam and his victory over the demon Surapadman with his vel, or lance. Festivalgoers wearing yellow or orange observe traditions including shaving of the head, and carry kavadis representing the fulfillment of vows to Murugam, thanking him for favors done or in advance for future favors sought. The most common kavadis are fruit, flowers, or a pail of milk, but others are as elaborate as heavy peacock-feather covered shrines carried on the head, representing the defeated demon who was transformed into a peacock. The most famous images of the festival are of devotees with cheeks and tongues pierced with ceremonial lances, and others hauling large kavadis with hooks in their backs. The piercings, along with fasting and ritual, induce a trance-like state intended to focus thoughts inward. At the caves a swami removes the piercings, lifting the spiritual burden. Located seven miles north of Kuala Lumpur, the caves were made famous in 1878 by zoologist William Temple Hornaday, better known for the time he put a Pygmy tribesman on display in the monkey house at New York’s Zoological Park. During Malaysia’s colonial heyday, the caves were a popular site for picnicking British couples. The stairs were added in more recent times. The gallery of the main Temple Cave at the top of the stairs is 300 feet high and 1200 feet long, with small openings letting in natural light. A smaller gallery is up another fight of stairs, mostly open to the sky. Two other smaller caves are also at the site. In 2006, a 140-foot tall concrete statue of Murugan was added at the foot of the stairs in the weeks preceding Thaipusam, a giant chrysanthemum garland draped around his shoulders by construction crane. The caves are home to colonies of long tailed-macaque monkeys which roam the stairs and the caves, and have been known to swipe sunglasses, cameras, and snacks from tourists. In 2009, more than a million people visited the caves during Thaipusam.  From Kuala Lumpur, take the KTM commuter train from KL Sentral station to the Batu Caves Station. Batu Caves station is the eighth (8th) station from KL Sentral. You can also take the public bus (11 and 11d). The public buses can be boarded at the Pudu Raya Bus Terminal in Kuala Lumpur. If you're two or more people traveling together, and it isn't a rush hour yet, think of taking Grab taxi, called also ""Asia's Uber.” When looking for something more adventurous make sure to check out tours offered by ""Dark Cave Malaysia"" company, operating on the grounds of the Batu Caves. During these tours you'll have a chance to enter part of the Batu Caves seen only by relatively few. If you are hungry, don't head straight back to the city center. Instead, try South Indian traditional Dhosa at one of the Indian restaurants situated right next to the caves. You can't miss them, since there are always people dining."
4,Kampung Kuantan Fireflies Park,"Bestari Jaya, Malaysia",Malaysian fireflies create a dazzling display as thousands light up in unison.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/flashing-fireflies-kampung-kuantan,"A small number of firely species perform an astonishing collective trick: They light up as one. Tens of thousands of fireflies will blink in perfect unison for minutes, sometimes hours, at a time. Known as “sychronicity,” it is a somewhat mysterious phenomenon. Even though each firefly flashes according to its own natural rhythm, it also receives feedback from flashing lights nearby. This feedback loop, an example of the mathematical concept known as coupled oscillation, eventually leads to a humongous mass of simultaneously blinking fireflies. One of the best places in the world to see this magnificent display is in Kampung Kuantan, Malaysia. Sadly, over the last ten years the beetle has been disappearing from the region due to poorly managed tourism and river pollution. All is not lost, however. Thriving colonies can still be found in the Bagan Krian mangrove tracts, the Tanjung Piai mangrove regions, and the Cherating and Kemaman shorelines, among other places."
5,The Pinnacles of Gunung Mulu,"Marudi, Malaysia",These jagged limestone blades cut out through the canopy of the jungles of Borneo.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-pinnacles-of-gunung-mulu-marudi-malaysia,"High atop the Malaysian mountain Gunung Mulu is an impressive alien landscape made of sharp rock spires that rise up out of the surrounding jungle like spikes of angry earth. The climb to the Pinnacle of Gunung Mulu is gruelling and dangerous, so much so that the national park is sometimes used by the Malaysian Army for training. However, those who are daring enough to make the trek to the top of the mountain will be rewarded with one of the most unique and stunning vistas in the world. The tall stone spikes known as the Pinnacles of Gunung Mulu are stark karst formations that were created as the soft limestone eroded away across millennia. Hidden so far up the mountain, the formations are relatively untouched by humankind and the only people to be seen for miles are other pilgrims to the bizarre bit of topography.  It usually takes a couple of days to reach the rock outcropping that serves as a viewing platform for the Pinnacles. Along the way, hikers encounter pitcher plants and toucans along with the grueling terrain. However, ladders and railings have been installed to help with the trek as much as they can. The park at large is also home to a number of large caves that make an excellent accompaniment to a visit to the Pinnacles."
6,Niah Caves,"Miri, Malaysia",One of the largest caverns in the world has a maw large enough to stack cathedrals in.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/niah-caves,"One of Borneo’s many and varied natural wonders, the Niah Caves are a system of colossal underground chambers large enough to fit a couple of Notre Dame Cathedrals stacked on top of one another. They also contain some of the earliest human remains ever found in Malaysia. The initial excavations into the Niah caves began in 1950s and ’60s when evidence of human habitation in the caves was found, including cave paintings and remains. The remains were found to be a staggering 40,000 years old, meaning the natural caves have been fascinating homo sapiens from cavemen to the camera-happy tourists of today. The cave paintings were found to only be around 1,200 years old, making them nonetheless interesting, but paling in comparison to the ancient bones. Today, the caves are a popular tourist site owing to their awe-inspiring size and natural beauty. The entrance to the main “Great Cave” alone is dozens of meters tall, inviting metaphorical measures such as how many churches or other huge structures could fit in it. No matter how you describe the caves, it is likely that it will be tinged with a sense of wonder.  Before entering the caves, you need to visit the Niah National Park office to purchase a ticket. The caves are about a 40-minute walk from the office. Because the caves are dark and slippery, bring a flashlight and sensible walking shoes."
7,Langkawi Sky Bridge,"Langkawi, Malaysia",This dangerous-looking suspension bridge may have been too unstable to remain open.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/langkawi-sky-bridge,"Curving wide around a forested mountain peak, the Langkawi Sky Bridge in Malaysia is an impressive feat of engineering, or so it would seem since the bridge has been closed for years with not much chance of reopening. Constructed in 2005, the steel skybridge is a pedestrian thoroughfare that allowed visitors to take a scenic stroll high above the lush forests of the Gunung Mat Chinchang mountain. After a tram ride to the foot of the bridge, the walkway winds almost leisurely around the very tips of a trio of mountains. The path is suspended over 2,000 feet above sea level by a single massive pylon that trails thick steel cables down to the bridge. The pieces of the over 400-foot bridge were lifted onto the mountain via helicopter and constructed at elevation. It looks both futuristic and almost frighteningly precarious. And as it turns out, these fears might be justified. After being open for a scant few years, it closed in 2012 for renovations and repairs. It partially reopened in February 2015 and is now fully accessible. Hikers can head to the nearby Seven Wells waterfall and hike to the summit of Gunung Mat Chinchang. It’s a tough, but easy to follow trek, that will take you between 1-3 hours one way, depending on your fitness level. The views are totally worth the struggle. There is no public transport in Langkawi and the place is quite far away (6+ miles) from the most popular areas of the island - Cenang and Kuah. So you will need either to rent a scooter, car or get a taxi."
8,BOH Tea Garden and Factory,"Cameron Highlands, Malaysia",The largest tea plantation in Southeast Asia supplies gorgeous vistas alongside tea for the surrounding countries.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boh-tea-plantation-and-factory,"The largest tea plantation in Malaysia is a massive spread of acres that supplies almost all of the tea for the considerable demand in the surrounding countries. It is also loaded with a natural beauty all its own. Founded during the British colonial era by the British businessman J. A. Russel, the plantation has grown considerably since 1929. It has expanded from a small tract of land in Habu to acres of tea-growing sites in Cameron Highlands. The cool climate and the rich soil of this province provide a fertile ground for cultivating tea. The name BOH comes from “Bohea”, the hills in Fujian Province where tea was originally thought to have been discovered. During World War II, the estate was occupied by the Japanese and largely abandoned. After Malaysia declared independence from the British Empire in 1957, many British planters left the country. But the Russels remained in Malaysia, and the company grew as they acquired several other tea farming operations. Today, at over 8,000 acres, the BOH tea plantation is the largest in Southeast Asia. BOH also processes its harvest in its own factory located in Sungai Palas. In the same site is the in-house cafe and gift shop where guests can purchase the varieties of tea produced in the factory."
9,Crystal Mosque,"Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia",Extravagant mosque honors modern Islam.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crystal-mosque,"Malaysia’s Islamic Heritage Park on Wan Man Island blurs the line between prayer and commerce. Although it is a tourist attraction that cost $80 million, it also features one of the most spectacular Islamic places of worship in the world, the Crystal Mosque. Created out of steel and glass, the mosque is unlike any other in the world. Its sleek and modern look reflects off the water and the mosque is often illuminated from the inside, which makes its glass domes shine. Keeping with its modern style, the entire mosque is also, bizarrely, connected with wireless internet and full IT facilities, seemingly a point of pride for the architects. The Islam Heritage Park also features replicas of many of the world’s most famous mosques from around the world. Oddly enough, in this theme park embracing Islamic culture across the globe, the Crystal Mosque contains elements of Chinese architecture and design, much to the irritation of many Malaysians."
10,Bamboo Playhouse,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",A delightful architectural wonder awaits on a lake island in Kuala Lumpur’s oldest park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bamboo-playhouse,"Designed by Malaysian architect Eleena Jamil, the Bamboo Playhouse is a public pavilion located in Kuala Lumpur’s Perdana Botanical Gardens. The sustainable playhouse features a three-dimensional floorscape and tree-like columns that rise up to support the roof, offering a playful reprieve for the public that blends into the surrounding landscape. The playhouse is situated on a small island in a large lake that stretches across the center of the gardens. The structure also contains a series of hanging “tree-houses” made from bamboo baskets, where visitors can enjoy meditative views of the lake. The playhouse has also been used as an event space for performances and exhibitions. The design also features raised square platforms set at various levels to create different dimensions across the open structure. Jamil took her inspiration from traditional structures called wakafs, which serve as resting places for village communities in Malaysia. Contemporary architectural designs made of bamboo are a rare sight in Malaysia, but the playhouse is a creative example of how the sustainable material can be used in fun new ways for other structures. According to Dezeen, “The Bamboo Playhouse was shortlisted [in 2015] for an award for a World Architecture Festival, where bamboo was touted as a revolutionary building material by Dirk Hebel.”  The Bamboo Playhouse is open daily from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m."
11,Dharma Realm Guan Yin Sagely Monastery Canteen,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Come for the chanting, stay for the monastical vegan buffet.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dharma-realm-guan-yin-sagely-monastery-canteen,"It’s not everywhere that you can enjoy a purely plant-based buffet followed by the communal recitation of the “Ceremony of Repentance of the Great Compassion with a Thousand Hands and a Thousand Eyes.” But at Dharma Realm, you can. This century-old Buddhist temple, built in dedication to Guan Yin, the bodhisattva of compassion, offers a rare tranquility within the bustling confines of Kuala Lumpur. It was one of the first temples in the city to be built with brick and tile. Pass through the renovated majestic building through the main gates, and around the back is the communal area for eating. Every day, the lines appear in anticipation for the vast vegan buffet. Local workers, curious tourists, and thrifty adherents queue up to await a lush spread of affordable, healthy, guilt-free options. Offerings run the gamut of Malay classics, from wantan mee to taufu pok and faux char siew; throngs come on Fridays for the special lei cha, or “thunder tea rice.” Most importantly, no white sugar, MSG, or preservatives are used in the cooking. Apparently, it’s as rewarding to consume as it is to serve: All the food workers at the temple are volunteers. Perspiring shoulder to shoulder among strangers over delectable plates of nourishing food may not sound luxurious, but in the afternoon heat, a curious sense of community emerges. Diners are invited to partake in chanting after the meal, if the spirit so moves them.  Dress modestly."
12,Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Hindu Temple,"Johor Bahru, Malaysia",Malaysia's first and only glass temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arulmigu-sri-rajakaliamman-hindu-temple,"Johor Bahru is Malaysia’s second-largest city. One of its oldest temples, the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Hindu Temple, was established in 1922. But it wasn’t until 1991 that temple’s new life began. Sri Sinnathamby Sivasamy inherited the temple from his father and inspired by the shine of glass artwork he witnessed while riding in a tuk-tuk he decided to remake the humble temple in all glass. The entire temple is covered in a mosaic of 300,000 multicolored pieces of glass, adorned with hundreds of thousands of glass beads, and contains statues of Gautama Buddha and Mother Teresa among others. Murals, done in glass, include some modern scenes of kindness and cross-faith love such such one of a Muslim and Christian helping a Hindu who got into a motorcycle crash."
13,Bukit Bintang Street Art Alleys,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Cartoon clouds and nature-inspired murals have transformed the streets of Kuala Lumpur.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bukit-bintang-street-art-alleys,"Bukit Bintang, meaning Starhill, is one of Kuala Lumpur’s most-visited districts. It’s home to some of the city’s biggest and most expensive shopping malls and restaurants as well as the street food mecca of Jalan Alor. Jalan Alor is one of the best-known jalans, or roads, of the district. Some of these were known for the same unsavory characteristics many major city back alleys throughout the world are known for. But in the late 2010s, Kuala Lumpur City Hall decided to transform these streets into art projects. Most of the murals that now decorate Bukit Bintang’s most infamous jalans were started in mid-2018 and completed in December of that year. A majority of the artwork in these central alleys dividing Bukit Bintang’s major city blocks comes in the form of painted murals with bright colors and natural imagery like rivers, rainforests, and tropical Southeast Asian fauna. A more novelty art type on display here are neon sculptures of cartoony cloud silhouettes that float above the street and light up at nighttime. One of the most notable natural inspirations to this arts district is the water stream painted on the floor, following the path of an actual stream that once flowed through Jalan Alor. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like Kuala Lumpur’s City Hall has released the names of the artists that designed and/or worked on this transformation. Perhaps this was not an oversight but rather by design, to emphasize the anonymous, self-less ideal of projects meant for the greater good.  While the jalans have been beautified, they are still back alleys in a major city’s tourist district, so take the usual caution when wandering through them, especially at night. The most-decorated alleyways are Jalans Alor, Berangan, Changkat, Rembia and Tengkat Tong Shin, but many other murals can be found in Bukit Bintang."
14,Kuching Cat Museum,"Kuching, Malaysia","Two thousand feline artifacts fill Malaysia's ""Cat City.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kuching-cat-museum,"Tracing the history of cats back 5,000 years, the Kuching Cat Museum houses 2,000 different artifacts, ranging from a mummified Egyptian cat to strange cat headstones. Although the Cat Museum is a mix of serious historical exhibits along with kitsch you might find in a cheap Chinatown bodega, it takes its work analyzing the history of cats very seriously. For centuries, Southeast Asia has had a history with cats, documented in great detail at the Cat Museum. Interestingly enough, Kuching actually means cat, making the location of the museum all the more apt. Besides stuffed cats, porcelain cats, and gigantic fang doorways, the museum also recounts bizarre superstitions around the animal, like nearly drowning a cat in order to bring rain. Outside of superstitious near-cat abuse, cat lovers should take solace in some of the more approachable exhibits, like Felis Badia, the rarest cat in the world, of which the museum is in possession of the only stuffed specimen.  The museum is open Monday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. To get there, either take CityLink Bus no. K15 from Saujana Food Court bus stop or hail a cab."
15,Snake Island of Borneo,"Kuala Penyu, Malaysia",This tiny island in the South China Sea is crawling with venomous sea snakes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snake-island-of-borneo,"Pulau Tiga Park encompasses 158 square kilometers of open ocean containing three islands that were formed by mud volcano eruptions in the late 19th century. While the largest island (Tiga) is known for its natural volcanic mud baths, the smallest island (Kalampunian Damit) boasts an attraction that is far less relaxing but perhaps a bit more fascinating: lots and lots of deadly snakes. An isolated rock covered with tall silver Pisonia trees, the calm pale surroundings of Kalampunian Damit — also known as Snake Island — stand in stark contrast to the community of wild serpents that call the island home. Known as yellow-lipped sea kraits or banded sea kraits, the venomous sea snakes spend their nights hunting deep waters for eels and small fish, returning to land by day to digest and get some sleep. Individual kraits tend to have one specific home island to which they return, forming a constant and fairly stable population. They also use their home base as a breeding ground, meaning Kalampunian Damit tends to be particularly snakey during mating season. While banded sea kraits are considerably more poisonous than cobras, they are also fairly reclusive and non-aggressive and bite humans only in rare occasions where they are harassed or trod upon — which can admittedly be easy to do on a tiny island full of snakes, but as long as visitors watch their step they are in little danger. Being somewhat off the beaten path, Pulau Tiga Park sees few visitors, and is most famous for being the shooting location of the first season of Survivor. Getting to the island is easy and just requires a booking set with an agent who will take you to Kuala Penyu Town, where a direct boat will leave from the jetty."
16,Taman Eko Rimba Kanching Waterfalls,"Rawang, Malaysia",Not far from the bustle of Kuala Lumpur is an amazing waterfall that navigates seven vertical drops.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taman-eko-rimba-kanching-waterfalls,"This hidden gem, just 35 minutes by car from downtown Kuala Lumpur is a must-see for a retreat from the busy city. Upon entering the park, visitors are greeted by a small space for picknicks, a few swings, and even a little restaurant. This area is also inhabited by a few monkeys so keep an eye on your belongings. If you advance further into the forest and follow the water, you will be greeted by the first tier of the waterfall, complete with a small pond that is open for swimming. The Taman Eko Rimba Kanching Waterfall travels down seven distinct tiers, all with specific distances up the hill. The park is usually not very crowded and often very quiet. It’s the perfect location to get up close and personal with the region’s diverse wildlife.  This place is only accessible by car or taxi since there is no public transport available."

There is even a scorpion pit.  The park is located close to the Perdana Botanical Garden, the Kuala Lumpur Bird Park, and the Malaysian National Monument."
18,Snake Temple,"Bayan Lepas, Malaysia","Come in, light some incense, and ignore the live snakes around you.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/penang-snake-temple,"Worshippers regularly visit this beautiful temple, located just under two miles away from Penang Island’s airport. However, the gorgeous place of worship has a unique catch: It’s filled with live pit vipers. The Snake Temple (officially known as Hock Hin Keong or Cheng Hoon Giam) was built in the mid-19th century to honor Chor Soo Kong, also known as Qingshui, a Buddhist monk and healer born in China during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The legend holds that during his lifetime, Chor Soo Kong sometimes offered shelter to local jungle snakes. After the temple was erected in his honor, it’s said snakes began showing up there of their own accord. Snakes aside, the temple is a beautiful piece of architecture. In its earliest years it was a simple attap structure, a traditional housing style found in the rural villages of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. But after decades of improvements and several major renovations, it has blossomed into a magnificent structure, featuring intricate detailing on the doors and rafter beams. The main temple opens into a courtyard, where the Shrine Hall of Kuan Yin is located, allowing visitors to marvel at the beautiful plants that populate the garden. Follow the pathway and you will arrive at the “snake pool,” where snakes recline on trees among leafy green branches, either basking in the sun or taking refuge in the shade. The snakes are thought to be kept docile thanks to incense being constantly burned. Locals will also tell you that many of the snakes in question, which are Wagler’s pit vipers and green tree snakes, have been de-venomed. Still, you’ll want keep your hands and feet to yourself at all times, and look around before you sit. It’s not recommended to bring small children, but the temple is a tranquil spot and they claim that no one has ever been bitten.  The temple is located about a 25-minute drive from downtown Penang, so either get a taxi, or catch the free shuttle bus. There is not much else around the temple, so consider trying to fit this in before or after the airport. On your way to the courtyard, you can also visit the exhibition next to the temple, which includes pythons and cobras. While entry to the temple is free, you do have to pay for a photo opportunity with these snakes. This is completely optional."
19,Ithaa Undersea Restaurant,"Rangalifinolhu, Maldives","An underwater restaurant, surrounded by a coral reef.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ithaa-undersea-restaurant,"To enter the restaurant, visitors climb down a spiral staircase in a thatched pavilion at the end of a jetty. They enter the building, which has a curved roof like a tunnel, from above. Secured five meters below sea level at the Hilton Maldives Resort and Spa, the Ithaa Undersea Restaurant is a mostly acrylic building that only seats 14. Offering a 270-degree panoramic view to its customers, Ithaa was designed and constructed by M.J. Murphy Ltd., a design consultancy based in New Zealand. Opened in 2005, Ithaa (which means ‘mother of pearl’ in Dhivehi, the local language) charges a premium for its meals, but they might cost less than one would expect for an underwater dinner. They start in price at about $120 US for lunch for hotel guests. The restaurant serves contemporary fusion Maldivian cuisine with Western and Asian influences. Advance reservations are necessary. Designed by the Kuala Lumpur National Science Center, the building qualifies as the world’s largest aquarium tunnel. After completion in 2004, Ithaa was taken to the Maldives on the back of an ocean-going barge. It took 16 days to arrive. It is estimated that the restaurant, which is placed in extreme conditions, will only last for 20 years.  1 Hour Sea Plane from Male International Airport"

The water here is filled with this plankton, and the movement of the waves causes it to glow, creating an incredible shimmering effect that looks like the sea is full of stars.  Vaadhoo Island in the Raa Atoll is the most well-known spot for viewing the plankton, though it is dependant on conditions and may occur on any of the islands. It is best to do more research if you are interested."

They have lots of dining choices, but by far the most unique is Subsix, a gourmet restaurant six (hence the name) meters (about 20 feet) beneath the surface of the Indian Ocean. In order to even see Subsix, visitors must come by speedboat. It’s a 40 minute trip from the capital, Malé, or a 15 minute one from Niyama Resort’s islands. The entrance to the restaurant is inconspicuous, just a mysterious pair of doors atop a short dock. Once there, they descend three stories beneath the waves into the “clam-shaped” bar. The building (constructed on land then sunk below the waves) sits central to a thriving coral reef. Sea anemone chairs and soft blue light invite the diners into the ocean world, not to mention the Hawkbill turtles, eels, and parrotfish swimming just beyond the glass."

Huge quantities of plankton flow through it, which enables the whole food chain to thrive. More than 250 types of corals are found in the Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve, sustaining about 1,200 species of fish. Baa Atoll refers to three distinct atolls that form a wider ring of islands covering a total area of 345,206 acres (139,700 hectares). Of the 75 islands in the Baa Atoll, 13 are inhabited by Maldivians, some are resort islands (where there is one tourist resort on the whole island), and the rest are uninhabited. The waters of the atoll vary in depth from 98 to 263 feet (30 to 80 meters), whereas around the atoll, the ocean plummets to more than 250 metres in depth. Look in the water, and you’ll likely spot parrot-fish, butterfly-fish, angel-fish, clown-fish, wrasses, marine turtles, moray eels, manta rays, groupers, whale sharks, and dolphins. Some threatened and endangered species found in the waters of the atoll include green turtles, hawksbill turtles, Napoleon wrasses, and tawny nurse sharks. The astonishing degree of biodiversity of the Baa Atoll extends also to above-water flora and fauna. Mangroves are present on virtually all islands, and among the most common animals are several types of lizards, skinks and geckos, fruit bats, frigate birds, and herons. The government has made a commitment to environmental protection, with a particular emphasis on recycling, which has led to the export of recyclable waste becoming a thriving business in recent years, second only to the export of fish.  Baa Atoll can be reached by ferry boats from Malé. Alternatively, there are frequent daily flights between the Island of Dharavandhoo and Malé. From Dharavandhoo, other islands can be reached by boat. The GPS coordinates for this place entry lead to the Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve Office on the island of Eydhafushi. Scuba diving indubitably increases the number of marine creatures you may encounter but it is not a requirement. Snorkeling in waters up to 16 feet (five meters) in depth is sufficient to see more species than you can name. The environmental impact of your visit also depends on the type of accommodation you choose. In this regard, islands develop their own waste management system that must comply with local regulations, which emphasise self-reliance and sustainability. Although official inspections are rare, some islands have taken environmentally friendly practices seriously. Some research before visiting is required, but it is possible to visit the Baa Atoll with minimal environmental impact. As mentioned, some islands are entirely dedicated to tourism, with one resort being the only structure on the whole island. The range of these resorts can vary, from gaudy to luxurious. For a more authentic experience, accommodation can also be found on the islands inhabited by Maldivians. This imposes some restrictions, such as dressing modestly in the villages, no alcohol, and limited nightlife."
23,"Thilafushi: the ""Rubbish Island""","Malé, Maldives",The exorbitant price of paradise.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thilasfushi-the-rubbish-island,"The Maldives island chain in the Indian Ocean is about as close as it gets to tropical bliss on Earth. The smooth white sand, tranquil blue water, and beautiful foliage annually attracts 750,000 visitors a year. But unbeknownst to most of these tourists, for decades the rubbish they produced - 3.5 kg per day - was being ditched on a floating, heaping pile of trash. In the beginning, Thilafushi was a lagoon composed of shallow coral reefs. In 1992, the Malé government decided to use the barrier island as the final destination for the enormous waste produced by their flourishing tourism industry. “Rubbish Island” as it was called, began receiving visitors in the form of massive refuse freighters, garbage excavators and migrant workers paid to handle the trash. For 20 some odd years, the man-made “island” was presented with approximately 330 tons of garbage a day, causing it to swell at a rate of one square meter every 24 hours. The newly-generated land was soon leased to entrepreneurs who used the island for various industrial activities. The island has of course suffered from the haphazard waste. The outrageous number of flies is a disgusting addition to the area, but isn’t the island’s biggest problem. Commercial activity along with indiscriminate dumping has brought an abundance of toxic materials to the lagoon - broken oil drums, asbestos, lead, and other noxious metals mix in with daily household garbage items creating a noxious sludge. There is little around the island that goes unpolluted as harmful substances seep into the water and smoke from burning waste floods the air. The government outlawed rubbish dumping on the island in 2011 after several freighters, impatient with the dumping process, jettisoned their loads directly into the sea. Garbage boats are reportedly now advised to shuttle their merchandise to India."
24,Dhigurashu Thun'di (Long Beach),"Dhigurah, Maldives","A narrow, serpentine spit of sand is constantly eroded and rebuilt by competing currents.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dhigurashu-thundi-long-beach-maldives,"Indian flying foxes—one of the largest bat species in the world—flit from one breadfruit tree to the next, their wings silent above the rhythm of the surf. Here on the island of Dhigurah, a narrow slice of sand and coral in the Maldives’ Alifu Dhaalu Atoll, about two hours by public speedboat from the capital of Malé, the ocean is always nearby. At its widest point, Dhigurah is only 300 meters across, though most of it is much narrower. Its slender shape—Dhigurah means “long island” in Dhivehi—is most dramatic at its southwest end, a sand spit that stretches for hundreds of meters between the atoll lagoon and the open Indian Ocean. Ocean and lagoon waves constantly compete to erode and rebuild the thin, serpentine sandbar, known as Dhigurashu Thun’di, or Long Beach. Yet the water on either side of the spit is surprisingly calm. It’s not unusual to see local children splashing in the waves while their parents set out a picnic nearby. About 600 people live on the island, and the spit is a popular destination for villagers at all times of day. A thin strip of tropical forest thick with palm and breadfruit trees offers shade from the midday sun. At sunset, sand and sky turn dramatic shades of red and orange as the lights of small fishing boats wink on in the gathering darkness. Just beyond the spit, waves crash together, hinting at the powerful forces in motion beneath the surface. Even then, at low tides on calm days, it’s theoretically possible to cross from the sand spit to another sandbar that leads to a small island, home to a luxury resort—though a no-trespassing sign warns you against doing so. The Maldives began welcoming tourists in 1972, and for most of that period, visiting meant flying into the capital of Malé and being whisked by chartered seaplane or private speedboat to a high-end resort island that was off-limits to locals. Since 2009, however, several “local islands,” dotted with guesthouses and small hotels, have opened to foreign tourists. On these islands, including Dhigurah, alcohol is banned and adhan, the Islamic call to prayer, echoes across the sand several times a day. Dhigurah is located close to several nearshore sites popular with whale sharks and manta rays year-round, drawing a growing number of foreigners eager to snorkel or dive with the animals. But Dhigurashu Thun’di remains a quiet, calm place of stunning beauty shared by locals and visitors alike, a slim line of white sand curving between a turquoise lagoon and the open ocean.  Dhigurashu Thun'di is accessible by foot from the island's village in about half an hour. Walking along the northwest-facing beach requires some wading. Reaching it via the southeast beach is not recommended due to the rocky coast and stronger currents. You can also reach the spit by following the island's ""Beach Trail,"" actually an unpaved road through the jungle. The road is used by villagers to access community gardens and the island's garbage collection site, so expect to yield to motorbikes and ""Cool Rides,"" a popular local vehicle that's half motorized tricycle, half mini-pickup. Unlike at the so-called ""Bikini Beach"" for tourists on the island's north side, modest attire is appropriate for Dhigurashu Thun'di, which is very popular with local families. Everyone visiting the Long Beach should be covered from shoulders and upper arms to knees."
25,Dharavandhoo Fish Market,"Dharavandhoo, Maldives","When the sun sets, the customers arrive—but they’re not human.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dharavandhoo-fish-market,"A small, open-air concrete building sits beside a palm tree at the east edge of Dharavandhoo’s pocket-sized harbor. A sign announces it as the island’s fish market, but it’s nothing like the bustling trade halls of Tokyo’s Toyosu or Seattle’s touristy Pike Place. Here, no money changes hands, and the diverse customers take whatever they’re offered, no haggling necessary. “Reef sharks, stingrays, sometimes nurse sharks up to three meters long,” says Ahmed Mahzoom, listing the fish that gather in the water at the harbor wall’s base. Mahzoom works at one of the handful of modest hotels and guesthouses on the tiny island, which is part of the Maldives’ Baa Atoll and home to about 800 people. From May to November, Dharavandhoo is a hub for tourists eager to see massive gatherings of manta rays in nearby Hanifaru Bay. It’s also popular year-round with divers and snorkelers in search of octopuses, moray eels, turtles, and more. But at the Dharavandhoo Fish Market, the fish come to you. In late afternoon, families gather along the harbor wall behind the market building, often grandparents with teens and children in tow. They handline fish, unspooling line from around a repurposed plastic bottle and tossing baited hooks from the wall’s concrete edge. If something bites, the fisher brings the line in, quickly wrapping it around the bottle, while their assistant waits with a net. Groupers, jacks, and other meaty reef fish are kept, but slender cornetfish and smaller species get thrown back. As daylight fades, the fishers and their families carry buckets with their catch into the market building, a tidy place with rows of filleting stations, sinks, and pump bottles of hand sanitizer. Meanwhile, the fish market’s customers gather outside. The sandy bottom and bright harbor lights make it easy to see the arrivals: one, then two, then six stingrays on this night, circling patiently just below the surface. Cowtail stingrays and paler porcupine rays glide around and over each other in a slow ballet of patience as they wait for dinner. A heron, also interested in what’s on the menu, perches on a nearby jetty. As the fishers gut their catch and toss the remains back into the water, the rays take turns surfacing, snacking, and then circling back to the end of the line in hopes of more morsels. The stretch of water illuminated by the harbor lights turns into a synchronized swimming performance. Even when sharks show up, locals say it’s an orderly affair. Night falls as the fishers prep the last of the day’s catch and pack it up to take home. The final handful of tails and innards is thrown into the water and a waiting ray takes it with barely a ripple. As the families leave the fish market, so do the rays, swimming into the darker waters beyond the harbor’s glow."
26,Khustain Nuruu National Park,Mongolia,The grassy landscape is home to the world's last truly wild horses.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khustain-nuruu-national-park,"One of the great comebacks of the 1990s took place not on the silver screen or the sports field, but in the grasslands of Mongolia. The takhi wild horses native to the grassy steppes had vanished from the wild in the 1970s, but as a result of various breeding programs, they slowly reappeared in their old stomping grounds, including their original home: the Khustain Nuruu national park. The takhi (officially named Przewalski’s horse after the Russian explorer who first spotted it), may be the world’s last truly wild horse. While most “wild” horses around the globe are domesticated horses gone feral, the Przewalski’s horse was never domesticated. Up until the 18th century, these short stocky horses freely roamed the steppes of Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Russian Siberia. But then the numbers started dwindling. In 1967, the last herd of takhi was spotted and in 1969, the last individual horse. They were declared “extinct in the wild,” which remained the status quo for nearly 30 years. There were only 13 surviving takhi horses, kept in different zoos around the world. They were bred carefully, and the population slowly increased to more than 1,500 at which point they were reintroduced into the wild. The downside of this method is that the genetic pool of all the existing horses is limited. One of the places where the reintroduction took place in 1992 was the horse’s native habitat of Khustain Nuruu or Hustai National Park. A year later the park, which stretches across 50,000 hectares, was declared as a Specially Protected Area. Its key mission is to maintain and build a sustainable population of these rare creatures. Visitors to the park can now spot teams of dun-colored horses wandering around the dry grassy landscape. Although the star of Khustain Nuruu is indubitably the takhi, the park is also home to other species like the red deer, steppe gazelle, the Eurasian badger, grey wolves, and the Eurasian lynx.  Khustain National Park is located 60 miles west of Ulaanbaatar, the Mongolian capital city. Public transport can drop the occasional visitor nearby the park, but a private car would certainly come in handy given the size of the park. Accommodation can be found inside the park itself, but several camps are scattered throughout the area."
27,Genghis Khan Statue Complex,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",Enormous statue of the Emperor of the Mongols.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/genghis-khan-equestrian-statue,"To most of the world, Genghis Khan is known as a brutal and savage dictator, whose campaigns of terror and wholesale massacre of civilian populations may have resulted in the deaths of up to forty million people. But to the people of Mongolia, he is revered as a national hero, ruling over the largest contiguous empire in history and establishing the Mongols as a political and cultural force. Despite being represented on dozens of statues and appearing on everything from bottles of liquor to cigarette packets, it seems that the public’s appetite for more has not yet waned. In 2008, a giant statue of Khan riding a horse was erected fifty-four kilometers from the capital Ulaanbaatar. At forty meters high, it is the world’s largest equestrian statue and stands more than double the height of the previous record holder in Uruguay. Made from two hundred and fifty tons of stainless steel, it reputedly cost $4.1 million to construct. At the base of the statue, visitors can visit an archaeological museum, try on traditional Mongolian costumes, tour the numerous portraits of the Khan lineage, or try the cuisine at the restaurant on the second floor before taking an elevator to to the top of the horse’s head, where they are greeted with a panoramic view over the surrounding landscape. The foundation building, designed to look like European Gothic style architecture, symbolizes that Genghis Khan is standing on Europe after his successful military campaigns, and he is returning East, his home country. If you stretch your eyes to the East, you will see a small statue of his mother greeting him.  The statue is located 54 kilometers from the capital city Ulaanbaatar. This place is also famous for its photo spot with wild birds. Visitors can take a picture with a golden eagle or vulture on their hand."
28,The Zaisan Memorial,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",A huge communist-era propaganda monument and mural that offers stunning views of the Mongolian capital.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-zaisan-memorial-ulaanbaatar-mongolia,"In many ways, the Zaisan Memorial is a massive show of appreciation for the Soviet Union, from the Mongolian people. Seeming to promote good relations between the two states, the monument was actually created by the Soviet Union to depict just how much they had done for the lowly eastern communist state. Located on a hill south of the city, the monument features a circular memorial painting that depicts scenes of friendship between the peoples of the USSR and Mongolia. Ostensibly built to commemorate Soviet soldiers in World War II, the sprawling mural also illustrates the defeat of the Japanese in 1939, which brought Mongolia into the Soviet sphere of influence. Of course the victory over Nazi Germany, a battle that subsumed Mongolian troops into the Red Army, is also prominently featured. In 2003, a tank memorial, featuring a Soviet tank from a brigade paid for by the Mongolian people, was moved to the foot of the hill. The tank memorial includes a map showing the route the brigade took from Moscow in 1943 for participation in the fall of Berlin in 1945. From the bottom of the hill, visitors can choose to make the climb of more than five hundred steps in order to reach the monument and mural. Those who make the climb receive a reward of a spectacular panoramic view of Ulaanbaatar, the surrounding mountains and the Tuul river. From Ulaanbaatar, look south and the huge monument will guide you."
29,Erdene Zuu,"Kharkhorin, Mongolia","The oldest Buddhist monastery in Mongolia has survived centuries of invasions, political shifts, and religious purges.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/erdene-zuu,"The establishment of Erdene Zuu dates at least to 1585, and some posit it goes back much further, as far as the 8th century. It is the oldest surviving Buddhist monastery in Mongolia. The name translated means “100 Treasures,” a nod to the number of original temples and the chain of stupas (mounded reliquaries) that form the exterior walls of the sacred site. Tangled in its legacy, there are the scars of centuries of fighting across those sacred walls. The history of Erdene Zuu is a mix of invasions, religious purges, political shifts, and outright murder. Damaged and dismantled in 1688 during a conflict between Dzungars (a confederation of Mongolian tribes) and Khalkha Mongols (historically ruled by the Khans), what remained of the monastery was reassembled in the 18th century. Again, in 1939, the order suffered a blow at the hands of Khorloogiin Choibalsan, the Communist leader of Mongolia, who ordered the destruction of scores of temples and the slaughter of thousands of monks throughout the country. All that remained of Erdene Zuu were three temples and a small order, with nearly one hundred structures destroyed and an estimated one thousand members either murdered or imprisoned. It was either sheer luck or the twisted wisdom of Stalin that saved the site from total destruction, kept as a token of “religious tolerance” to be put on display for international visitors, including U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace during a trip in the late 1940s. Intervention by the Soviet leader convinced the Mongolian regime to spare the monastery, a move motivated less by goodwill than by political pretense. But tolerance under Stalin and Khorloogiin Choibalsan only went so far, and the monastery was forced to convert into a museum. It remained in this religious limbo until the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviets and reversion of the site to the lamas. It still wears both hats today, and the wall of 108 stupas that surround the compound, clearly visible from a mile away, are in a good state of repair. Inside there are several temples and additional stupas, the oldest dating to 1799.  One particular area of historic destruction by the Communists is cordoned off, but its foundations are still visible. There are plans to rebuild, but work has yet to begin. Erdene Zuu, after so many centuries of sheer will to survive, will get that work done. Part of the Orkhon Valley Cultural Landscape World Heritage Site, the monastery is in central Mongolia, about a quarter mile northeast of the center of Kharkhorin."
30,International Intellectual and Puzzle Museum,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia","An institution dedicated to curiosity, logic, riddles, and Mongolia's long history of puzzles.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/international-intellectual-museum,"Mongolia has a history of puzzle-crafting, and has created some of the world’s most difficult puzzles and chess sets. Shatar, a Mongolian version of chess, dates back to the Middle Ages, while more modern burr puzzles (made from interlocking pieces of wood) can be traced back throughout the 1900s. Mongolia’s enigmatic history is honored at the International Intellectual Puzzle Museum, or the IQ Museum for short. The museum is the creation of Tumen Ulzii, who was born to nomadic herders and would have followed that path had he not fallen in love with logic puzzles at an early age. His father gave him a six-piece burr puzzle with one piece missing. After he solved the problem of the missing piece he began creating his own puzzles, eventually founding a company to manufacture logic games for the youth of Mongolia and a museum to showcase puzzle and logic history. Ulzii’s work has not gone unrecognized—he has been awarded the prizes for “Best Inventor in Mongolia” and “Meritorious Person of Culture.” The museum displays some puzzles created by Ulzii himself, as well as rare and precious puzzles from around the world. Over 5,000 toys, puzzles, and games are on view, most of which visitors are invited to fiddle with. Ulzii’s inventions are usually wooden, the pieces carved into whimsical Disney characters and animals of the zodiac. Some even depict figures from Mongolian history, like Genghis Khan. The simplest are the traditional six-piece models, but some puzzles in the museum include as many as 350 pieces. There are also various puzzles made from gold, precious stones, and silver. One turtle-shaped puzzle offers a prize of $100,000 if solved within a specific timeframe. In the museum’s three decades of operation, no one has ever solved it. Mongolian chess, another of Ulzii’s passions, is also featured in the IQ Museum’s exhibits. Masterful woodcarving, a skill essential to crafting the intricate puzzles, is also exhibited at the museum in the traditional furniture which decorates the space. The purpose of the museum is not just to catalogue the history of puzzles in Mongolia, but to remind visitors that curiosity and play are an important part of training the brain. Visitors to the museum are guided by a docent who performs magic tricks, watches you struggle with the puzzles, and reveals their solutions to you in a matter of seconds. No photos are allowed inside the museum apart from one display at the end. Open your mind to the challenge of games and puzzles and enjoy the fun and beautiful craftsmanship of the exhibits."
31,The Mother Tree,"Shammar, Mongolia",This spiritual landmark for practicers of Shamanism is drenched in milk and vodka and covered in blue scarves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mother-tree-shammar-mongolia,"Although Buddhism is the most widespread practiced religion in Mongolia, Shamanism is alive and well. Often, the two religions blend into one, and landmarks throughout Mongolia testify to this. The Eej Mod or “Mother Tree” in Shaamar is one stand-out example. Its fame spread beyond Mongolia and worshippers from Japan, Korea, and China  come from afar to pay homage to the Mother Tree. Those who practice Shamanism believe that shamans communicate between the human and spiritual worlds, and the Mother Tree became seen as a gateway to the spirits after it was struck by lightning. Now worshipers will travel to the tree to make an offering in hopes of having their prayers answered. Until 2015, the Mother Tree was an actual tree, around which a ger (aka yurt) had been built. Following a practice that thousands of others had engaged in before, one worshipper in 2015 lit an incense stick by the tree, but this time the tree caught fire, and it was all but destroyed.  The stump was salvaged from the fire and placed in the outside compound. Today, the ger is still in its place, and the ground where the Mother Tree once grew is the object of people’s veneration. The stump, alongside a number of nearby trees, is shrouded in ceremonial scarves, mostly blue, and drenched in milk and vodka. The fence around the compound is “fortified” by tea bricks.  In an adjacent compound, another tree has been elevated to the status of Holy Tree in recent years by an eminent Mongolia shaman. Along the main road running through Shaamar, there is a sign saying Eej Mod (in Mongolian script) pointing left (heading north). There is no well defined road, but tracks going off road are visible at the sign. The Mother Tree is a couple of kilometres along those tracks."
32,Khamriin Khiid,"Urgun, Mongolia",Mongolian Buddhists believe this monastery in the Gobi desert to be the center of the world's spiritual energy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khamriin-khiid,"According to Mongolian Buddhism, a spot in the middle of the Gobi desert is where the strongest spiritual energy in the world converges. To mark the location, the monastery complex was built in the 19th century, Khamriin Khiid. The original Khamriin Khiid monastery was founded in 1820 by Danzanravjaa, known as the Terrible Noble Saint of the Gobi, who observed the location’s tremendous energy. At its peak, the monastery housed up to 500 monks, and included more than 80 temples within the complex. Danzanravjaa was a great scholar and practitioner of the arts, as well as a social reformer. He set up a theater at the monastery for people to develop their singing and acting skills, and a public school, which encouraged education for both men and women. The lively and productive monastery was destroyed in 1937, in the wake of the Communist purge against religions, and Khamriin Khiid in its current form was reconstructed in 1990. Today, hundreds of pilgrims visit the site every day at dawn to benefit from the spiritual energy that is believed to radiate as a new day is born. Shambala, the centerpiece of the complex, is surrounded by 108 stupas, encircling other holy monuments and temples, the most prominent of which has a large pair of eyes staring at visitors. The enclosed space is said to be warmer due to the energy that emanates from Shambala, and it is not uncommon to see pilgrims taking off their shoes to better absorb the energy. Another form of worship is the throwing of rice, millet, milk and vodka on monuments. Other visitors walk around singing a song composed for Khamriin Khiid. Outside the enclosure are the series of caves where Danzanravjaa and other monks meditated for 108 days, two huge breast-shaped mounds covered in milk, a wind-activated bell, and the actual monastery."
33,Flaming Cliffs,"Bulgan, Mongolia",Dinosaur eggs were first discovered at these fiery red cliffs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/flaming-cliffs,"In the evening, these desert cliffs glow with a fiery red light that seems to mimic the radiance of the setting sun. The cliffs are best seen from below or across the escarpment. But no matter where you stand or what time you visit, you can still witness the breathtaking magnitude and raw beauty of the place come to life. The local geology is just as captivating as the cliff’s blazing light show. This landscape within the Gobi Desert is arguably among the most important sites for dinosaur fossil hunters, and research around the cliffs has proven to be particularly fruitful. Dinosaur eggs were first discovered in this area in the 1920s, and a fossil of a Protoceratops and a Velociraptor locked in a fight were unearthed in the 1970s. To date, paleontologists are finding important fossils in the surrounding area. The Flaming Cliffs are a prime example of what’s known as a Djadochta Formation, layers of sand and calcareous matter. Even by geological standards, the cliffs are an ancient formation, with the best estimates clocking their birth at 71 to 75 million years ago. Another fun fact: The Flaming Cliffs are also called Bayanzag, which means “rich in saxaul,” one of the few plants that can survive the extremes of the Gobi: extremely cold, extremely hot, and extremely arid. Saxaul is a thorny shrub that is better left untouched. Camels, however, seem partial to it. The roughly 60-mile dirt track from Dalanzadgad is compacted rocky desert that makes for an exceptionally smooth ride. Signs, however, are few and far between. It is best to go with someone who knows the area or to ask for directions along the way, even if you think you’re on the right track. Although it’s not uninhabited, it is still a desert, and the risks that this implies should not be underestimated."
34,Central Museum of Mongolian Dinosaurs,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",An exceptional assortment of fossils recovered from private collections.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/central-museum-of-mongolian-dinosaurs,"The Gobi Desert on the Mongolia-China border is a beautifully desolate area, but millions of years ago, when dinosaurs roamed, it teemed with life. That combination makes it a world-class source of fossils. It’s the type of place where you can find protoceratops skulls, dinosaur eggs, and a full skeleton of Tarbosaurus bataar, all of which are on display at this museum in Ulaanbaatar. While the museum itself is a bit shabby and rarely appears on Ulaanbaatar itineraries, it holds some real paleontological gems within its walls. Its openly mounted skeletons of original fossils rather than cast copies are a rare sight to behold. The first sight past the ticket booth is a showstopper: the dramatically lit Tarbosaurus bataar skeleton, which closely resembles a Tyrannosaurus Rex, the famed North American predator. Another room (of three) contains a full skeleton of an oviraptor, which stood at a height equivalent to a human’s chest. Perhaps even more incredible than its collection is the museum’s origin story. While Mongolia is a treasure trove of dinosaur fossils, the country’s riches have long been smuggled beyond its borders. This was the case for the museum’s entire collection, until foreign courts mandated their return. The judgment of an American court to hand over the Tarbosaurus bataar skeleton in a case launched by Mongolia’s president prompted the museum’s founding. Another case made headlines when Nicolas Cage returned a Tarbosaurus bataar skull he had bought years earlier (the American actor was not accused of wrongdoing). These successes have spurred more repatriation efforts and investments. So while it may be some time until live stegosauruses wander an amusement park, a shiny future for Mongolian paleontology appears within reach.  Displays in Mongolian and English explain each specimen and offer informational tidbits, such as why it's entirely reasonable to ask if dinosaurs had feathers. A local, English-speaking guide is usually on hand as well. The museum is open everyday from 10 to 7 (summer) or 9 to 6 (winter), even during holidays such as Naadam. Look for a giant depiction of a dinosaur erupting from the building's facade. That is the side entrance—walk clockwise to the front door."
35,Ovoos at Terkhiin Tsagaan Lake,"Tariat, Mongolia",A jagged silhouette of shamanistic stone heaps rises from the shore of this dazzling mile-high lake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ovoos-at-terkhiin-tsagaan-lake,"Terkhiin Tsagaan Lake is one of the most dazzling in Mongolia, sitting a mile and a quarter (2,060 m) above sea level. On the northeast shore you can see a dramatic and jagged silhouette against the azure sky, made by shamanistic heaps of stones called “ovoos.” Ovoos are found on many high peaks throughout Mongolia, and according to tradition, when someone approaches he or she is to circle it three times (always clockwise), and then add a few rocks to the ever-reaching pile. Over time they grow, often to impressive heights, some as high as 10 feet (3 m). Terkhiin Tsagaan is also known as White Lake, due to the thick layer of snow sitting on its frozen surface for the better part of the year. Local legend says that the lake was created by a giant tossing a rock that made an enormous hole on landing, but the more down-to-earth explanation goes back thousands of years, and an eruption of the nearby Khorgo Volcano. This geological history is partly what makes the Terkhiin Tsagaan Lake ovoos stand out: They are made by using the black lava rocks that pepper the surrounding terrain. This, and the sheer number of them—in all, hundreds have been ritualistically created, making for a singular and eerie landscape. Terkhiin-Tsagaan is in west-central Mongolia, and the easiest way of accessing the lake is by following a dirt road from Khorgo Volcano. This leads to the north-east shore of the lake, where the ovoos can be found."
36,Taikhar Rock,"Battsengel, Mongolia","People have been scribbling on this massive chunk of granite for more than 1,500 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taikhar-rock,"Taikhar Chuluu (Taikhar Rock) is a 66-foot high granite block set in the middle of a huge expanse of flatland and rolling hills. Strangely, its shape and unusual location aren’t its most fascinating features. The rock has 150 writings etched all over its surface. The scrawled sentiments cover the rock from top to bottom. The most ancient of these writings are in Turkic languages and date back to the 6th century AD. You’ll find words jotted down in other languages, too, like Mongolian, Tibetan, and Chinese. The inscriptions are proof that Taikhar Rock has been an important site for more than 1,500 years. Adding new writings is a tradition that continues to this day, though most of the current inscriptions seem to mainly be about political slogans or declarations of eternal love. An oovo (a heap of sacred stones) was placed on top to reassert the religious significance of this site. There are two radically different explanations for the rock’s unusual appearance—one mystical, one scientific. According to one account, a mythical giant named Bukhbilegt used this looming chunk of granite to plug a hole in the ground once frequented by a gargantuan snake. But according to a more plausible theory, Taikhar Rock is the result of the nearby river eroding the granite mountains and flooding the area over millions of years."
37,Imperial Map Monument,"Harhorin, Mongolia","History, geography, and shamanism meet in this eye-catching monument to the greatness of three empires.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/imperial-map-monument,"Imperial Map Monument commemorates the three empires that settled on the shore of the nearby Orkhon River. Also known as King’s Monument and Monument for the Mongol States, it was built in 2004 on a hill overlooking the town of Kharkhorin. The monument consists of a large pile of stones (a shamanic ovoo) carefully assembled in the shape of a cone, approximately the same size as a tepee, with nine poles protruding from the top. This structure is mounted on a stone-and-concrete platform, and it is surrounded by three walls representing three sections of a circle. The outer sides of these walls feature three colorful mosaics depicting three maps, one for each of the empires. First, there was the Xiongnu Empire, a confederation of nomadic tribes living in the steppes from around the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE. The Turkic Khaganate Empire followed, established by the Göktürks in 682 and lasting only until 744. Finally, and famously, Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire of the 13th and 14th centuries. The Mongol Empire’s iconic place in the culture, combined with the shamanic symbolism of the ovoo in the center of the monument, entice people to leave offerings of vodka, milk, tea, rice, and other edible titbits that inevitably attract birds and the occasional herd of goats and sheep passing by. Several animal skulls can also be found around the monument, completing the surreal scene. It is no coincidence that the Imperial Map Monument is located in Kharkhorin, as this town (then called Karakorum) was the capital of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan’s successor, Ögedei. Imperial Map Monument is a great vantage point to take in the modern town of Kharkhorin and the Orkhon River, and picture what this collection of dirt roads and low-rise buildings may have looked like in its glory days.  The monument is on the east side of the Orkhon River. It's a roughly 10-minute drive from the more easily located Erdene Zuu Monastery."
38,Mongolian Military Museum,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia","Thousands of artifacts tell Mongolia's military history, from the Bronze Age to the present.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mongolian-military-museum,"From Bronze Age knives to modern hand grenades and from catapults to rocket launchers, this museum delivers when it comes to weapons. It’s stuffed with artifacts detailing Mongolia’s long military history. The Mongolian Military Museum is divided into four sections and houses around 8,000 items related to the ancient and modern Mongolian army. It was opened in 1996 under the supervision of the Ministry of Defense. Two sections of the museum are on the ground floor. The first section is dedicated to weapons found in archaeological sites all around the country. You can spot items like bows, arrowheads, axes, and knives from the Bronze Age. Weapons and objects such as armor, horse saddles, and stirrups from later epochs are also collected here. Alongside these artifacts you’ll find reconstructions of other old military items like several swords, two 13th-century uniforms, and a catapult stand. The second section of the museum is packed with modern weapons from the 20th and 21st centuries. Most of the items are from World War I and World War II and are predominantly Mongolian, but you’ll also spot some Russian, Japanese, and German weapons in the mix as well. There are also numerous portraits of Mongolian military heroes and a cordoned-off area with a painting of Lenin looming over a desk. A section focusing on Mongolia’s post-World War II participation in peacekeeping missions was donated by the United States Embassy. In the basement is the third section, which by and large is a continuation of the second. The top floor is the most recent addition to the museum and it consists of displays of Mongolian military uniforms from both current and bygone eras. Last but not least, in the yard are some tanks, anti-aircraft guns, armored vehicles, and an MIG fighter plane."
39,Danzanravjaa Museum,"Sainshand, Mongolia",Hidden treasures belonging to Mongolia's most revered and multi-talented monk spent decades buried in the Gobi desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/danzanravjaa-museum,"The story of the museum dedicated to Dulduityn Danzanravjaa, one of Mongolia’s most revered and multi-talented monks, is almost as dramatic as the man himself. His treasured possessions, such as several kangling (flute made of human femur), a damaru (double-headed drum made of two human skulls), and two kapala (cup made of human skull cups) were long buried in remote, secret locations around the Gobi desert. Danzanravjaa, known by epithets such as the “Lama of the Gobi,” belonged to the Nyingma school of Buddhism, and was the fifth reincarnation in the Noyon Khutukt line of monks. He was born in 1803 and was identified as a lama when he was 12, before which he wandered around the Gobi with his minstrel father, singing songs for money. His biggest claim to fame is his poetry, in which he criticized social evils that he witnessed around him. This is followed closely by his divination, paintings, and writings on medicine, philosophy, and astrology. He was also an active advocate for public education, and set up a primary school, a library and a museum at the monastery where he resided. As if this were not enough, Dulduityn Danzanravjaa was also a talented dancer and choreographer, and established a theatre company that staged dances, plays, and operas promoting women’s rights. In short, Danzanravjaa was the consummate Renaissance man, and is remembered for his immense contributions to all of these fields. Danzanravjaa died in 1856 under shadowy circumstances, believed to have been poisoned by one of his enemies. With the end of his life began the story of the museum in his name that stands today. One of his trusted disciples, Balchinchoijoo collected all his possessions, stored them in crates, and acted as the curator of Danzanravjaa’s relics. This role was passed down to his heirs, and it was the duty of a descendent named Tudev to safeguard them during the Soviet era in the 20th century. At the time, there was a crackdown against religious institutions and artifacts, and hundreds of monastic complexes in Mongolia were destroyed. Tudev carefully prepared each crate for storage and even set traps for extra protection. Every night he buried one in a remote location in the Gobi desert, and memorized the location. In this manner, he managed to bury 64 of the nearly 1,500 crates before the army destroyed the remaining artifacts. He passed on the information about the location of the buried treasures only to his heir, his grandson Altangerel. When Mongolia became free of Communist rule in 1990, it was finally safe for Altangerel to dig up the crates and see what remained of artifacts. Another 24 boxes were unearthed and the relics were placed in the museum in Sainshand, which was opened the following year. Among the exhibits are the costumes used for his theatrical productions, the aforementioned kangling, damaru, and kapala, some shamanistic implements, samples of his manuscripts, and other paraphernalia rescued from the many monasteries that he set up."
40,Centre of Shaman Eternal Heavenly Sophistication,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",A nondescript dirt lot hides an intriguing center of shamanic healing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/centre-of-shaman-eternal-heavenly-sophistication,"The Centre of Shaman Eternal Heavenly Sophistication is a rather grandiose name for a place that is, to say the least, underwhelming at first sight. The center is a small dirt yard wedged between modern buildings and a busy road. Like many others in the neighborhood, this dirt yard has a ger (traditional tent) and a semi-permanent ger-like structure. But don’t be fooled by its initial appearance. This place may lack in charm or distinctiveness, but it’s supposed to be as authentic as it gets. A shaman renowned for her power to mediate between this and the other world lives on the premise, and more than one shaman may be on the premise at any given time. The semi-permanent ger-like structure is the heart of the center. There’s no sign and no indication it’s anything other than someone’s private dwelling, so it can be quite unnerving to push the door open. All along the circular perimeter of the structure there are tables and cabinets neatly displaying statuettes, figurines, seashells, beads, pebbles, incense burners, scrolls, drums, antlers, bones, and other (seemingly) random items. The circular display is interrupted by a large wooden chair sitting on a bear skin and by a collection of furry and feathered costumes, a heavy leather outfit, and traditional hats. Outside, there’s an altar that consists of some poles arranged in the style of a tepee and covered by animal hide, but the strong winds from the steppes have blown away part of the covering. A table for offerings and three tridents adorned with yak hair complete the altar. Other features in the yard include two white statues, an ovoo with the skull of a bull, and the ger where the shaman lives. No one knows for certain how long shamanism has been part of Mongolian culture, but it’s been present since at least the earliest recorded history. Instead of being pushed aside by the arrival of Buddhism, it mingled with it, giving birth to the Mongolian Buddhist tradition. The socialist regime repressed all forms of religious expressions, but shamanism never died. With the collapse of the socialist regime in the last century, it came back. Now, it’s pretty common to come across people offering shamanic services. Pictures aren't allowed within the actual center, but you can photograph the outer yard."
41,Petroglyphs of Tsagaan Salaa-Baga Oigor,"Ulaankhus, Mongolia",These ancient pecked images are among the oldest and best-preserved in Mongolia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/petroglyphs-of-tsagaan-salaa-baga-oigor,"Among the snow-capped peaks, freshwater lakes, and grassy valleys of Altai Tavan Bogd National Park, thousands of ancient petroglyphs cover the rocks of the Tsagaan-Salaa Valley. Located in the westernmost province of Mongolia, the 15-kilometer site is home to at least 10,000 figures pecked and engraved during the Neolithic Period and the Bronze Age. Many of the petroglyphs depict humans herding or hunting wild animals, offering a glimpse of how the hunter-gatherer lifestyle would eventually give way to the domestication of animals as livestock. A closer look reveals that some of the figures resemble extant wildlife—animals that continue to roam this alpine landscape today—such as red deer, ibexes, and snow leopards.  Keep in mind that petroglyphs can only be conserved if admired from a distance. Please refrain from touching, rubbing, or walking on the artwork."
42,Bagan,"Nyaung-U, Myanmar (Burma)","Over 2,000 ancient temples dot the Myanmar landscape at the site of this famed archaeological site.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bagan,"At its prime, the former city of Bagan on the plains of central Burma was likely a wondrous metropolis of ornate, gleaming temple spires and ritual artistry. But it’s possibly even more beautiful and mysterious now that it’s a jaw-dropping ruin. During its heyday around the 12th century, the capital of the Kingdom of Pagan contained well over 10,000 Buddhist temples, stupas, and pagodas. Eventually, the city was brought to ruin by natural disasters and hordes of Mongols, who made light work of the city’s Buddhist inhabitants. Through the centuries, thousands of the temples and pagodas crumbled under their own weight or were destroyed, leaving only a little over 2,000 of the structures today. However, this has done little to diminish the scope of the city’s grandeur. The almost impossibly ornate temples that survive rise up out of the overgrown foliage. The structures, which burst from the plains, look like the creations of a lost civilization. While that is not strictly true, as many of the inhabitants of Bagan would sire the generations that created modern Myanmar, a sense of mystery still pervades the city. Still covering 26 square miles of land, the thousands of ruined temples and religious monuments are now a protected historical site. While some of the structures have fallen into complete disrepair, many others almost look as if they haven’t aged a day, thanks to modern restoration efforts.  The best place to lodge in the area is Old Bagan. With the influx of tourists in recent times, new hotels in New Bagan and Nyaung-U are also opening. Bagan can be toured on foot, giving you an impressive perspective of the old city, although the preferred method of experiencing the ruins (technically known as the Bagan Archaeological Zone today) is via hot air balloon. Balloon rides are offered that bring visitors to a vantage point where they can view the thousands of temples at once. However, the hot air balloon season in Bagan is very short (from October 1 to March 31) due to the extremely hot weather in the region. Other good alternatives to explore the archaeological site are horse carts (the old fashioned way) or e-bikes, which can be more efficient since the ruins are spread out."
43,Kakku Pagodas,Myanmar (Burma),This unique temple complex remains off the typical tourist trail.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kakku-pagodas,"Kakku Pagoda offers a unique alternative to the plentiful temples spread throughout Southeast Asia. Visiting this extraordinary site takes time and effort. While most of Kakku’s stupas were built in the 17th and 18th centuries, the largest is believed to have been built in the 12th century during the reign of Alaungsithu, King of Bagan, as part of expanding religious sites across his empire. Since then, two main architectural designs have created a distinct forest of 2,478 needle stick pagodas that reach out to take the shape of Buddha’s footprint. From the main stupa, where wisps of omnipresent incense smoke perfume the musty air, visitors can walk through the small channels within rows of smaller stupas, each breathtaking in their nuanced designs, many featuring stucco reliefs in differing forms of veneration. While the renovation is ongoing, plenty of the stupas suffer from varying degrees of weathering and damage from the odd earthquake that blights many temple complexes within Myanmar. Due to its remoteness and location within Shan State, visitors are few, although the authorities have created a reflecting pool for photographic delights. Thankfully, unlike at other more famous temples, there isn’t the need to wait for hours to get that cover shot.  Tours are available from the Inle area. If traveling independently, admission to the site is US $3 and a compulsory, but knowledgeable, Pa-O guide costs $5 payable at the tourism office in Taunggyi. From there a taxi will take you and your guide on a bumpy two-hour ride to Kakku Pagodas complex. Nearby, a café will refuel you after the long journey and offers local delights and trinkets."
44,Inwa,"Inn Wa, Myanmar (Burma)",A grand imperial capital left to fall into magnificent ruin.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/inwa,"For a total of 360 years spread over the course of five centuries, Inwa was the capital of successive Burmese kingdoms. Then, in 1839, it was leveled by earthquakes and subsequently abandoned. The wheel of fortune turns on us all, human and city alike. Inwa — also spelled Innwa, known in classical Pali as Ratanapura (“City of Gems”), and known locally as Awa or Ava — was originally founded in 1365. Located at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Myitnge Rivers on an artificial island formed by a canal connecting the two rivers upstream from their natural point of meeting, Inwa was built to be the capital of a newly unified kingdom that came to be known, appropriately enough, as the Kingdom of Ava. And so it remained for 190 years, serving not only as the seat of power in Upper Burma, but also as the center of a flourishing period of Burmese literature. In 1555 the Kingdom of Ava fell. However, the city of Inwa and its political prestige lived on, serving as the capital of all of Burma from 1599 to 1613, then again from 1635 to 1752, then again from 1765 to 1783. Then again from 1821 to 1842. The aforementioned series of devastating earthquakes struck on March 22, 1839; the entire region was affected, but the capital was hit particularly hard. Although Inwa had been sacked, destroyed, and rebuilt several times over its long history, this time it would not be so. The city was not rebuilt, the capital was officially moved to Amarapura on February 10, 1842, and Inwa was left to the elements. The former imperial city is now a rural area where livestock graze and farmers raise crops amidst the remains of pagodas, palace towers, monasteries, and massive city walls that once formed the outline of a seated lion. One of the monasteries — Bagaya Kyaung, a towering structure built entirely of teak — is still in use as a monastery and school today. Local guides provide tours of the site via horse-drawn carts."
45,The Mingun Pagoda and Bell,"Min Kun, Myanmar (Burma)",Gigantic unfinished stupa and the world's 2nd largest bell.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mingun,"Nice pile of bricks you’ve got here. The Mingun Pahtodawgyi is a nice pile of bricks indeed and holds the record for being the biggest pile of bricks in the world. Intended to be a 500 foot high stupa, a mound housing Buddhist relics, the Pahtodawgyi remains unfinished to this day but is still an awe-inspiring structure. Measuring 450 by 450 feet and 172 feet high, it dwarfs the surrounding area, and would easily have rivaled the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza had King Bodawpaya finished its construction. Construction began in 1790, using mostly slave labor, and causing a massive drain on resources and manpower in the area. The project was widely unpopular during its time, which some suspect caused its cessation. King Bodawpaya was a superstitious man and during the construction, it was prophesied that the completion of the great stupa would cause his death or the destruction of the country. Worried about maintaining his empire, the king slowed progress on the stupa. When he died, construction was abandoned completely. Despite not completing the stupa, construction on an accompanying bell was finished, and was similarly grand in size. The finished bell weighed over 200,000 pounds and is 12 feet high. The massive bell can be rung by striking the outside since it has no internal ringing mechanism. Since the early 19th century, the stupa has become increasingly decrepit. An earthquake in 1839 left giant cracks along the face of the stupa, and wear and tear have led it to become almost natural looking. Without the bright white entrance, visitors could easily mistake the stupa for a large earthen mound, or simply a pile of bricks. Entrance is 5000 K (US $3.50)"
46,Kyaiktiyo Pagoda,"Thaton District, Myanmar (Burma)",A precariously perched golden rock defies gravity and brings pilgrims from across Myanmar.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kyaiktiyo,"Perched dangerously on the edge of a cliff, pilgrims have been visiting the Kyaiktiyo Pagoda for centuries to meditate and give offerings to the Buddha. Whether this worship keeps the boulder from rolling down the precipice is unclear, but the gold-leaf covered stone certainly inspires all who visit. At 25 feet high and 50 feet around, the golden boulder in Mon State, Myanmar is hard to miss. According to legend, a Buddhist hermit was given a strand of hair from the Buddha himself, which he then gave to the king. For his gift, the king offered the hermit a boulder shaped like his head, and used magical powers to pull the boulder from the ocean. The king then built the small pagoda atop the rock to enshrine the Buddha’s hair for all eternity and pilgrims have flocked to the site ever since. Although the pagoda is small by comparison to other grand Buddhist places of worship, its location on the precarious boulder makes up for its miniature 24-foot spire. Seemingly barely resting on its base, the precariously placed golden rock draws thousands every year. Pilgrimage is at its peak during the Full Moon day of Tabaung in March, when 90,000 candles are lit at the site and the golden boulder shines in the night sky. There is accommodation available at the top of the Mountain, or in Kinpun, at the foot of the Mountain, where you can then travel up by pick-up truck (one way costs 2,500 Kyat). Getting to Kinpun is a 4-5 hour bus ride from Yangon, or 6 hour train journey."
47,Shwedagon Pagoda,"Yangon, Myanmar (Burma)",This gem-encrusted temple is said to contain some of the Buddha's hair which can make the deaf hear and the blind see.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shwedagon-pagoda,"Towering over the Burmese city of Yangon, the Shwedagon Pagoda is rumored to be the oldest Buddhist pagoda in the world, and more miraculous than the priceless gems and gold plates coating its exterior, it is also said to hold hairs from the head of Buddha himself. As the legend goes, two brothers were traveling when they encountered the Buddha beneath a tree. After feeding him, Buddha offered them a gift and gave them exactly eight hairs from his head. The brothers then carried the sacred hairs in a ruby casket back to their country where, with the help of the king, they began building what would become the Shwedagon Pagoda complex. When the casket containing the holy hair was opened, the relic unleashed a flood of miracles including causing the blind to see, the lame to walk, and seeing a rain of gemstones issue from the sky. A number of other relics were also entombed at the shrine including a holy staff, a piece of cloth from a sacred figures robe, and oddly a revered water filter. If the legend is believed, the pagoda is around 2,600 years old, but many scientists have placed its construction closer to 1,000 to 1,400 years old. Either way, the opulent site has survived through war and political turmoil in the area and still looms over Yangon in glittering glory. The large central stupa is covered in real gold plates that are constantly donated from countries around the world as needed, and its tip is encrusted with rubies and diamonds. Both spiritually and materially glorious, the Shwedagon Pagoda is one of the wonders of the modern Buddhist world, and may be one of the fanciest sites ever to be founded on a handful of hair. Head towards the golden stupa that towers over Yangon. Shwedagon Pagoda is open daily, from 4-22. Last admission is at 21:45. The ticket is valid for the whole day, so you can visit the pagoda during the day and also at night. Shwedagon Pagoda on weekends and middle of the day can get really crowded, so avoid this time. If possible hire a guide, who will explain everything about the pagoda and the rituals, enhancing your experience hugely. You won't be allowed to enter the temple grounds if you're dressed in shorts. You can rent or buy a sarong outside the entry gate."
48,Saddar Cave,"Hpa-An, Myanmar (Burma)","Caves full of Buddhist statues, incredible rock formations and a deserted lagoon.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saddar-cave,"Like other sacred sites in Myanmar’s Zwegabin mountain range, Saddar Cave has been decorated with hundreds of Buddhist statues over the years. The landscape around the small town of Hpa’an in Karen State, Myanmar, combines lush open fields and single, bulbous mountains. At the bottom of one such mountain is a steep staircase, painted white. Once at the top, a narrow path leads you into the Saddar Cave, hollowed out of the rock. Buddhist statues, like road signs of all different shapes and sizes, beckon visitors into the darkness. Hundreds of miniature golden icons not much bigger than playing cards form a mosaic onto the righthand side of the cave. You’ll pass a pagoda about the size of a small van and the light then weakens. Visitors must remove their shoes. Only then does the stench of bat droppings fill the nostrils. Sometimes you can hear the bats shriek. Inside the mountain, the painted faces of Buddhist sculptures occasionally flicker into view as you wander through the darkness. Karen State is famous for its Buddhist sites, but Saddar Cave is truly a natural wonder, as well as a holy place. Flash photography illuminates stalactites dripping from the ceiling and stalagmites rise up from the ground, formed over centuries. In one section of the cave a ray of sunshine beams down directly onto one of the largest stalagmites. The path ends at the entrance to open water, where a local boatman armed with a paddle next to a flat wooden canoe will continue your journey out of the cave and out onto a pristine blue lagoon. Paddle around and watch fisherman source their lunch against a backdrop of the limestone rock face. The Soe Brothers Hostel in Hpa'an arranges travel to Saddar Caves."
49,World's Largest Book at Kuthodaw Pagoda,"Mandalay, Myanmar (Burma)","This golden temple is surrounded by hundreds of stone tablets that comprise the ""world's largest book.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-s-largest-book-at-kuthodaw-pagoda,"Call it the “anti-Kindle,” call it the “world’s largest book,” or call it “really hard to read,” there is no disputing that the expansive tome etched on over 700 stone slabs surrounding Myanmar’s glittering Kuthodaw Pagoda form a volume that would test even the most ardent book lover. The Kuthodaw Pagoda was built 1857 by King Mindon Min. The gorgeous temple building is completely gilded on the exterior, giving it the look of a solid gold spectacle. However the true spectacle lays within the stark white stupas that surround its base. Beneath the pinnacled roofs of the squat little structures are 730 marble tablets (729 contain body of the text, while the 730th tablet describes their creation) covered on both sides with dense script. Taken all together, these comprise the entirety of Theravāda Buddhism’s religious canon, its tipitaka (a phrase meaning “three baskets,”which is a reference to the baskets in which the original Buddhist teachings were held). The thick stone tablets each stand over five feet tall and five inches thick. When the tablets were unveiled in 1868, each line of writing had been filled with golden ink and the stones were decorated with precious stones including rubies and diamonds. Unfortunately after the British invaded in the mid-1880s, the troops looted the temple site, stripping the slabs of their gold ink and gems. However today the sprawling book still stands, and the writing has been refilled with simple black ink so that while the opulent glory may have disappeared, the messages of the writings themselves live on for future generations. It might not be light reading, but it is assuredly enlightening."
50,Thanboddhay Pagoda,Myanmar (Burma),"Luxurious devotion and 500,000 images of Buddha in Myanmar.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thanboddhay-pagoda,"On the average cathedral tour of Europe, tourists quietly take in the immense stained glass, the high vaulted ceilings and somber atmosphere. The average pagoda tour on the other hand is the complete opposite, and in many ways the most quintessential difference between East and West. Thanboddhay Pagoda is a massive Buddhist complex in Monywa, Myanmar. It is a gilded world, brightly screaming out praise for Buddha through colorful celebration. Throughout the area, each pillar and tower of the Pagoda is carefully and completely covered with images of Buddha. From statues inside the pagoda, to miniatures climbing the sides of the building itself, there are 500,000 depictions of Buddha in total. Although it was originally built in the early 14th century, it was reconstructed in 1939, and is incredibly preserved in its golden form. Unlike many other temples in Myanmar, the entrance is not guarded by lions. Instead, two imposing white elephants stand out against their shimmering backdrop. Since its reconstruction, the pagoda has been one of the largest tourist attractions in Myanmar, drawing awe-struck tourists and pious religious visitors alike."
51,Mount Popa,"Myingyan, Myanmar (Burma)","Myanmar's Mount Olympus atop a 2,500-foot volcanic plug.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sacred-mt-popa,"Established and maintained by a hermit in the early 20th century, the Mount Popa shrine and monastery precariously sits 2,500 feet off the ground on a massive volcanic formation in central Myanmar. Climbing 777 steps from the base of the vertical pedestal takes you to a monastery honoring what has come to be known as the center of Nat spirit activity in the nation. In Buddhist traditions of Myanmar, Nats are spirits of humans that met tragic ends and are portrayed accordingly in shrines across the country. One of the most well-known of the 37 spirits in the shrine of Mount Popa is Ko Gyi Kyaw, who died from his wild lifestyle and alcohol abuse. As the patron saint of tramps and alcoholics, his shrine is often covered in bottles of whiskey. Due to the Nat activity and shrine on Mount Popa, the area is known as the Mount Olympus of Myanmar. The shrine subsequently draws thousands of pilgrims every year, especially during full moon ceremonies two times per year. Non-religious visitors can enjoy panoramic views of the lush mountains, as well as the monkeys that live and beg for food around the monastery. Estimated 2,000 Rhesus macaques live in the monastery today and because of this, monkey poop is prevalent on the monastery steps (which pilgrims and visitors are supposed to climb barefoot). Consequently, a high number of people make their living cleaning up after the monkeys in exchange of a donation, and this fact has originated mixed feedback from visitors to Mount Popa.   Mount Popa is roughly 30 miles Southwest of Bagan. Wearing comfortable clothing covering the neckline and shoulders, cotton skirts (or pants) is ideal. The dress code is the same as for visiting Bagan temples. Since you are expected to walk barefoot, you can also bring socks to protect your feet."
52,U Bein Bridge,"Mandalay, Myanmar (Burma)",The oldest teak bridge in the world is made from the remains of a royal palace.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/u-bein-bridge,"Stretching across Taungthaman Lake in Myanmar, the U Bein Bridge might look like just another rickety wooden crossing (which it is), but this historic span is actually made of the remains of a royal palace. Construction on the wooden bridge was completed in 1851 after three years. The bridge was built at a slight curve, and is supported by over a thousand wooden pillars that were hammered into the bottom of the shallow lake. The planks of teak that make up the surface of the bridge were taken from the old royal palace of Inwa, a former Burmese capital, that had been razed a number of times. The resulting bridge might not look very royal, but its history certainly is. Reaching three-quarters of a mile in length, the ramshackle span is surprisingly long for a wooden bridge with no rails, but it cuts a striking figure. The bridge has become one of the region’s most popular tourist attractions and most photographed features. It is especially striking in the evening when the colors of the sunset paint the scene in natural color. This of course means that the bridge becomes more crowded during those times. All the attention has taken its toll on the span. Some of the pillars have been replaced with concrete, and many of the original planks will need to be replaced or refurbished, lest they come off completely. Nonetheless, the bridge is still a beautiful and popular place to capture the beauty of Myanmar."
53,Snake Pagoda of Myanmar,"Kyaukse, Myanmar (Burma)",These serpents are considered holy and pampered accordingly.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snake-pagoda,"Officially called Yadana Labamuni Hsu-taungpye Paya, this Myanmar pagoda is generally known by another name: Hmwe Paya, or the “Snake Pagoda.” This out-of-the-way pagoda near Mandalay is distinguished by the large pythons who live happily coiled around the Buddha statue within. The temple was founded in 1974 when a Buddhist monk was tending the old pagoda. Inside, the monk found two large pythons wrapped around a statue of Buddha. The monk dutifully carried the snakes out to the jungle and returned to clean the pagoda. Within a day the snakes were back, and a third had joined. Each time, the monks would carry the snakes out to the jungle, and each time they would return. Eventually the monks came to see the snakes as holy, possibly the reincarnated souls of monks who used to tend to the pagoda. The monks stopped removing the snakes and instead began taking care of them. They take such nice care of them, in fact, that it makes sense that the snakes like to hang around the pagoda. The two pythons currently in residence are fed a pot of milk and three eggs every five days as well as a small amount of goat meat. Every morning at 11:00 a.m., the snakes are lovingly washed by the monks in a bath filled with flower petals. They are sometimes even dried with money left as an offering at the pagoda. Each year, thousands of the faithful make a pilgrimage to the temple, and the walls of the pagoda are lined with photos of families visiting the semi-holy serpents. Some depict toddlers happily bathing alongside the snakes. They snakes have never been known to injure anyone and seem quite happy to be touched by the visitors. Though the original pythons have died, new snakes have since been donated by faithful followers. The original snakes can still be seen in the pagoda, albeit in a taxidermied state. Considering the level of care the snakes receive, the snakes no doubt lived a long and happy life. The area surrounding the snake pagoda is also worth exploring and is full of overgrown and beautiful ruins rarely visited by tourists. It's best to get a car and driver in nearby Mandalay."
54,Nagar Glass Factory,"Yangon, Myanmar (Burma)",The ruins of this prominent glass factory yield hidden treasures buried among the jungle floor.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nagar-glass-factory,"A small snarl of jungle in Yangon, Myanmar (Burma) hides a trove of glass treasures. Those who visit can expect to find beautiful glass works in shades of blues, greens, whites, and reds buried beneath the mess of flora. The Nagar Glass Factory was Myanmar’s premier glass-making enterprise for decades and the country’s first hand-blown glass-factory. Their customers included the Pan Am airline company, independence leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and even the astronaut John Glenn. But it all came to an end when Cyclone Nargis, the worst natural disaster to ever hit the country, obliterated the factory in 2008. What remains in the jungle around the ruins of the former factory are the countless pieces of colorful glass that were in production or storage at the time. Amazingly, a large percentage of them somehow remain completely intact. It’s a bizarre, otherworldly and strangely beautiful site, even if the circumstances that led to its current state are tragic. Today, the family that ran the factory for decades still accepts visitors. In fact, every piece of glass lying in the jungle is available for purchase. It’s up to each visitor, however, to dig for his or her own treasure among the sprawling forest. While you’re there, be sure to take your time while scavenging through the layers of leaves that blanket the floor beneath the masses of toppled trees. You’ll be rewarded with small treasures like wine glasses, drinking glasses, and fruit bowls. The Nagar Glass Factory is about a 20 minute walk from either Kamaryut or Thiri Myaing stations on Yangon's circular train line. It's not the easiest place to find and there are no signs along the way to point you in the right direction. Furthermore, many locals aren't even aware that it's still possible to visit. It's best to just rent a SIM card and find your way there with your smartphone."
55,Shwenandaw Kyaung Temple,"Mandalay, Myanmar (Burma)","A grand example of 19th century Burmese teak architecture, and the most significant of Mandalay's historic buildings.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shwenandaw-kyaung-temple,"The Shwenandaw Kyaung Temple, or Shwe-Kyaung-pyi as it is known to the Burmese, is the most significant of Mandalay’s historic buildings, due to the fact that it is the sole remaining structure of the former wooden Royal Palace that was built by King Mindon in the mid-19th century. It was originally part of the royal palace complex in Amarapura, but was subsequently moved to Mandalay, where it became known as Mya Nan San Kyaw. Following its move, it became the northern section of the Glass Palace and also part of the king’s royal apartments. It would also be the final home and resting place of King Mindon, who died in this structure in 1878. King Mindon’s son Thibaw, who succeeded his father following his death, often used the building as meditation grounds, but became convinced that his father’s spirit still haunted the grounds, so he immediately ordered the building to be dismantled and removed from the Royal City. Over the course of the next 5 years following its dismantling, the building was reconstructed as a monastery and dedicated as a work of merit to the memory of King Mindon. During the latter stages of World War II, the rest of the old Royal Palace within the old Royal City burned as a result of allied bombing of the Japanese encamped in the old Royal Palace. Due to King Thibaw’s superstition and relocating of the building, he had preserved a significant remnant of the Royal Palace. Entrance to Swenandaw Kyunag is included with the Mandalay Archeologic Zone combo ticket, which also includes Atumashi Kyaung, Cultural Museum Mandalay, Kuthodaw Paya, Maharani Paya, Mandalay Palace, Paleik Paya, Mandalay Palace, and the ancient cities Amarapura and Inwa."
56,Pegu Club,"Yangon, Myanmar (Burma)",An eerie abandoned gentlemen's club built for British officials during the colonial era.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pegu-club,"This deteriorating Victorian-style clubhouse was built in 1882 just outside of what was then Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar). It was constructed during the annexation of Burma by the British, as an exclusive watering hole for soldiers and officials of the British Army. The complex features long, two-story mansions that served as ballrooms, salons, and private rooms. It was one of the most prestigious and popular of the gentlemen’s clubs built in Southeast Asia during the height of the British Empire. The club wined and dined British royalty and many high-ranking officials within its walls, and its name lives on through its signature gin-based cocktail, the Pegu Club, that’s still served in bars today. Sadly, the racist membership policy of the time limited admission to whites only, and locals were only allowed in the club as workers. Somewhat surprisingly, the club stayed open for about two decades after Burmese independence was gained. It was eventually taken over by the Burmese military and later abandoned and left to rot. For years, the old colonial-era clubhouse remained in a state of decay, desperately in need of repair. After significant restorations, it reopened for business in November 2018."
57,Shwe Indein Pagoda,"Taunggyi, Myanmar (Burma)","A vast, otherworldly collection of Buddhist stupas.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shwe-indein-pagoda,"To get to the Shwei Indein Pagoda, one must come to Myanmar in the rainy season, and wind by boat from Inle Lake down eight kilometers of twisting canal. In the winter, the water is too shallow for travellers, making the already remote site even more so. Upon disembarking, a visitor will discover a hillside complex containing over 1,600 Buddhist stupas, some of mud and stone, some intricately carved, some gilded with precious metals. While several have been restored, many have been reclaimed by the surrounding jungle and lay partially crumbled, covered in creeping greenery. These structures date from the 14th to the 18th centuries and are typical of Burmese zedi. Like others found across the region, the stupas feature fantastical creatures like chinthe - mythic lion-like beings that protect sacred spaces. These were (and remain) sites for contemplation and meditation and many contain relics inside their bases. The first stupas at Indein were likely commissioned during the reign of King Narapatisithu, although according to legend, it was King Ashoka - the Indian emperor responsible for spreading Buddhism across much of Asia - who first designated this as a site of particular spiritual importance. Hundreds of years later, that distinction is completely obvious. The sea of ornate spires coupled with the view over the lake and surrounding calm lend this spot an unquestionably mystic, reflective air. From Nyaung Shwe ask for a boat (~18,000 kyat per boat) to take you to Indein,"
58,Swayambhunath Monkey Temple,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Sacred Buddhist home of some spiritual monkeys.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/swayambhunath-monkey-temple-in-kathmandu,"This is a workout, wildlife excursion, and spiritual escape all wrapped into one. Be prepared to huff and puff your way up 365 steep steps to meet some furry friends at this Nepali Buddhist site. Located atop a hill west of Kathmandu city, the Swayambhunath complex has been in use since the 5th century and consists of a magnificent domed stupa, as well as a variety of shrines and temples. Each temple is extremely ornate and richly decorated with gold and vibrant prayer flags, though it’s not only the spiritual décor that draws visitors. This sacred pilgrimage site is also home to hundreds of monkeys considered holy to Tibetan Buddhists and Hindus. According to legend, Manjushree, the bodhisattva of wisdom, was in the process of raising the temple hill when the lice in his hair transformed into these monkeys. Swayambhunath means self-arisen and is derived from that legend. The story alone provides enough inspiration for visitors to struggle through the climb to the temple, and the sights at the summit are worth the trek. From the top of the hill, visitors can see a panorama of the Kathmandu valley, along with playful monkeys swinging from trees and prayer flags hanging around the colorful temple. Although the monkeys are somewhat active during the day, the stupa truly becomes a monkey temple at night when hundreds of monkeys frolic in the sacred area and even slide down the banister of the primary structure.  The temple is easily accessible by foot, bike, or taxi from Kathmandu."
59,The Garden of Dreams,"Kathmandu, Nepal",This elegant neoclassical garden is a peaceful oasis in the middle of the Nepalese capital.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-garden-of-dreams,"The Garden of Dreams (Swapna Bagaicha) was the idyllic vision of Kaiser Sumsher Rana, a field marshal in the Royal Nepalese Army who ordered its creation on the grounds of his palatial home in 1920. Though the garden was severely neglected following his death in 1964, the exquisitely manicured landscapes and the surviving fountains, pergolas, and pavilions have since been restored to their former glory. The four-acre Garden of Dreams in Kathmandu was designed by landscape architect Kishore Narshingh to mimic Edwardian-era English gardens. Most notably, the site was characterized by six pavilions, which symbolized the “six seasons” of Nepal: spring, early summer, the summer monsoon season, early autumn, late autumn, and winter. In its heyday, the garden was considered one of the most remarkable feats of landscape design in the country. Today, visitors will only find three pavilions on just over an acre of land, but the 74,000 square-foot space remains a verdant attraction thanks to a restoration project spearheaded by the Austrian government and Nepal Ministry of Education. Through the garden’s original gates are picturesque fountains and ponds, an amphitheater, isolated gardens of varying sizes, and the Kaiser Café Restaurant & Bar. Meandering pathways are lined with hedges, plants, trees, and flowers from all over the world, complemented by charming stone urns and intricate benches that offer contemplative vistas. While the Garden of Dreams has been transformed into a public space, it remains a tranquil escape in the center of Kathmandu, and a popular hangout for sunbathers, wanderers, residents, and tourists alike.  The Garden of Dreams is open daily from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m. It's located in the Kaiser Mahal complex in the busy Thamel neighborhood of Kathmandu. Admission to the garden costs Rs. 400 per person for tourists and Rs. 100 for Nepali residents. Wifi is available throughout the garden for Rs. 50 an hour."
60,Boudhanath Stupa,"Kathmandu, Nepal",One of the largest Buddhist stupas in the world keeps an eye out in every direction.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boudhanath-stupa,"For hundreds of years, the Boudhanath Stupa has stood as a beacon of Buddhist belief, towering over the surrounding town as a giant mandala of peace and beauty and also giant eyes. Built some time around the 14th century, the huge meditative monument is said to have been created just after the passing of the Buddha. The huge offering site quickly become an focal point of worship and offering in the area. The structure of the building consists of a giant dome, on the top which sits a Buddhist pyramid tower. All of this sits on top of huge steps shaped like mandalas themselves. Originally the stupa’s spot was on an important trade route which allowed for a steady stream of possible converts. Among the Nepalese in Kathmandu, the stupa is simply referred to as “Chorten Chenpo” which translates to “Great Tower” or just “Great Stupa.” No matter what pilgrims called it, they flocked to the monument in droves. Despite having existed for years, the site did not truly become the center of Tibetan Buddhism until the 1950s as refugees from China immigrated over to Katmandu. Temples and devotional sites began to spring up throughout the surrounding city and further far afield, strengthening the power and importance of the site immeasurably. While it is hard to determine their specific age, the base of the stupa tower is decorated with pairs of eyes on each of the cardinal directions representing the all-knowing nature of the Buddha. However, for those not fully indoctrinated into Buddhist belief, the building (while quite peaceful and beautiful) does seem to be peering down on visitors as they come to make offerings or just to see one of the more spectacular Buddhist sites in the world. The entrance is just basically a gate in a wall."
61,Namche Bazaar,"Namche, Nepal",Last stop before the top of the highest peak in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/namche-bazaar-nepal,"Most explorers deciding to tackle the dangers of Mount Everest ready their supplies in the bustling markets of Kathmandu before heading to the brutal ascent to the summit. However, even explorers and adventurers forget to pack things sometimes. In this eventuality, they can stop at the Namche Bazaar, the final major outpost of civilization before the desolate mountain climb begins in earnest. Built along the side of a Nepalese hill, the ramshackle settlement increased in size with the swell in demand for supplies and equipment that came with the deluge of explorers following in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Hillary’s successful Everest ascent. The marketplace village now includes such amenities as internet cafes, a currency exchange, locally-renowned bakeries, and even a small Irish pub. In addition to picking up any supplies, you might need before attempting to climb the world’s highest peak you can also make a stop at Namche’s Museum of Sherpa Culture to learn more about the history of the local people who might keep you alive on your journey. Limited by the geography of the area, Namche Bazaar contains no more than 60-some dwellings amidst the various business endeavors, but the village still manages to hold the distinction of being the wealthiest district in Nepal. If you find yourself making the trek to the top of Everest be sure to stop in the mercantile community and pamper yourself (sort of)."
62,The Yeti Scalp of Khumjung,"Khumjung, Nepal",A Himalayan monastery claims to have a piece of a centuries-old abominable snowman.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-yeti-scalp-of-khumjung-khumjung-nepal,"A small village monastery in northeast Nepal claims to have a 300-year-old Yeti scalp, one carried by Sir Edmund Hillary across the globe for inspection by zoologists and other experts. Despite its purported provenance, it did not pass inspection. The half football-shaped scalp sits in a cabinet at the temple, or gomba, of the village called Khumjung, and for a few Nepalese rupees the monks will take out a small, glass-fronted box containing the scruffy-haired dome. But no matter how much the donation, the scalp stays in the padlocked box. The relic is purported by the village to have come from one of the “abominable snowmen” of Himalayan legend and was found by Hillary and journalist Desmond Doig in 1960 when they were on an expedition to look for evidence of the big-footed beast. They found the scalp in the home of old Khumjung woman, who said it was a good-luck charm for the village and was anxious about letting it leave. In order to avoid disaster befalling the village, Hillary agreed to a deal: If he made a donation to the monastery and a local school and took with him a guardian for the scalp from the gomba, they would let it leave and be examined. The scalp turned out to have been fashioned from the hide of an animal, most likely a goat-antelope native to the Himalayas. After its trip and reported debunking, it was returned safely to the monastery; you can read more about that, as well as the duplicate of the scalp at New York’s Explorer’s Club, here, then make up your own mind if they really exist or not. As Khumjo Chumbi, the monk who was charged with watching over the scalp on its round-the-world voyage, told the Guardian newspaper at the time, “We don’t believe in giraffes and lions in Nepal because there aren’t any there. Likewise, you don’t believe in yetis because you have none in your country.” Khumjung is in northeastern Nepal, about 85 miles east of Kathmandu (as the crow flies) and inside Sagarmatha National Park World Heritage Site, an uphill side-trip from the trekking route between Namche and Gorak Shep. When you reach the village, catch your breath and look for the monastery."
63,Kathmandu Durbar Square,"Kathmandu, Nepal",This historic square in Nepal is home to temples dating back to the third century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kathmandu-durbar-square,"Kathmandu Durbar Square, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of three squares within Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. Durbar Square (durbar translates to “palace” or “a court held by a prince”) is an important site for Buddhist and Hindu rituals, holy ceremonies, royal events, and kingly coronations. Surrounded by fountains, ancient statues, small ponds, and a series of courtyards such as Mohan Chok and Sundari Chok, Kathmandu Durbar Square is a meditative, religious site for spiritual seekers. Within the inner complex of Durbar Square is the site of the Old Royal Palaces (referred to as the Hanuman Dhoka Palace Complex). The Royal Palaces used to house the kings of the Shah and Malla Dynasty, who ruled over the city until the 19th-century. The palaces have since been turned into museums. The outer complex consists of numerous pagoda-style temples featuring the meticulously carved facades crafted by Newar artists, some of which date back to the 16th-century. Under the direction of the Malla Kings, Durbar Square underwent a series of changes and new architectural additions. King Mahendra Malla (1560–1574) commissioned the construction of the oldest temples in Durbar Square. Built in the Newari architectural style, his contributions included the Jagannath Temple, Kotilingeshwara Mahadev (a stone temple of Lord Shiva), the Mahendreswara Temple, and the magnificent Taleju Temple (the largest and perhaps most important temple of them all). Although these date back to the 16th-century, it’s believed that construction for the square itself and the palaces began as early as the 3rd-century. Later, King Pratap Malla added more additions to the square, including shrines and new temples, and also restored many of the older temples. When he passed away in 1674, new constructions stopped, but picked up again during the Shah Dynasty. One of the most unusual sites built during the Shah Dynasty is the nine-storied structure called the Nautale, commonly referred to as Basantapur Durbar. Located at the east side of the palace, the structure has four roofs and was rumored to be a “pleasure house.” Other popular temples in the square include Mahadev Temple, Shiva Parvati Temple, Maru Ganesh, Bhagwati Temple, Saraswati temple, octagonal Krishna Temple, Jagannath Temple, and the Kal Bhairav (which represents the destructor form of Lord Shiva). Perhaps the most peculiar (and revered) sites at the southern edge of Kathmandu Durbar Square is the three-storied temple called Kumari Bahal. This Newari temple, built by the last Malla king Jayaprakash Malla, houses the Kumari Devi–a young girl chosen through a highly selective process and believed to be the living embodiment of the Hindu mother goddess. The Kumari Devi is paraded around the square in a custom-made gilded chariot during the festival of Indra Jatra and others, and worshipped by the people, who carefully watch her for specific signs that may allude to their fortune and fate. After a devastating earthquake-plagued the area in 2015, many of the ancient temples and historic pagoda-style structures were severely damaged. Kathmandu Durbar Square was designated a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1979, and continues to undergo considerable post-earthquake renovations and reconstruction efforts.  Foreign nationals can enter Kathmandu Durbar Square for NPR. 1000."

At the heart of this ancient city is Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Many of the smaller streets around the city converge onto this square where the royal palace of the Bhaktapur Kingdom was located. The monuments and temples around the site represent the history and traditions of medieval Nepal. Everything around Bhaktapur still looks as it did during its medieval heyday. In fact, Bhaktapur is among the most intact ancient cities in Nepal. It was also given the distinction of being listed as a UNESCO world heritage site."
65,The Toothache Tree,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Nailing a coin to this holy stump is just another way to ask the gods for relief from dental pain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-toothache-tree-kathmandu-nepal,"The gnarled hunk of wood known as Vaisha Dev, or the Toothache Tree, sits at an unassuming chowk (intersection) just past Thahiti Tole, but visitors could be forgiven for not realizing that it is a tree stump since locals making an offering to the god of sore teeth have covered it in nailed on coins. Said to be a cutting from a legendary tree known as Bangemudha, the chunk of wood that has been put in place smack in the heart of Kathmandu’s dental district, which is home to a concentration of orthodontists’ offices, acts as a sort of wishing well. People with toothaches or other dental ailments visit the site and nail coin to the tree as an offering to Vaishya Dev, the Newar god of the toothache. Supposedly there is a teeny tiny little idol inside of the main hole of the tooth god’s shrine, although the coins nailed on every part of the log obscure any view into the burl. In fact, the log is so covered that none of the actual wood is visible anymore either. The superstitious site is as attractive to worshippers as it is to the dental professionals all around it. As people with tooth problems come to visit the shrine the hope is that they will be lured in by one of the brightly-colored signs advertising the dentists in the area. Orthodontists know an opportunity when they see one (generally in the mouths of candy-crushing twelve-year-olds)."
66,Annapurna,"Khangsar, Nepal","Named after the Goddess of Harvests, Annapurna is the deadliest member of the Eight-thousanders club.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eight-thousander-mountain-annapurna,"There are 14 independent peaks that make up the “Eight-thousanders”, an elite group of mountains that tower more than 8,000 meters (26,247 ft) above sea level, all of which lie in the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges in Asia. The most popular of these mountains, Mount Everest, has taken the life of many a brave or foolhardy explorer, but there is another Eight-thousander that makes Everest look like a kiddie ride. Her name is Annapurna. Since the first recorded ill-fated expedition of Albert F. Mummery and J. Norman Collie in 1895, men and women have been compelled to conquer these peaks, and ironically the first successful ascent was located on Annapurna by famed adventurers Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal in 1950. The expedition was successful, but not without a heavy cost – Herzog lost the majority of his fingers and toes to frostbite, and to stave off gangrene had to perform amputations on the mountain, sans anesthetic. No one dared to climb Annapurna again for 20 years. Annapurna is not the tallest mountain – in fact, it’s 10th tallest on the list of the 14. Yet it currently has a fatality-to-summit ratio of 38% which, though recently improved from 40%, is still the highest fatality rate of any of the Eight-thousanders. Why it claims so many lives is uncertain, although the glacial architecture and the illusions it produces have been cited as examples of its treachery. Whatever the reason, this quiet giant with the difficult south slope has called over 200 explorers to her snowy cliffs, and decided to keep over 50 of them as her own."
67,Rinchenling Gompa,"Muchu, Nepal",This remote Himalayan temple is in danger of being completely washed away by a melting glacier.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rinchenling-gompa,"Jettisoned straight out of Middle Earth and onto our planet, the Rinchenling Gompa is quite an otherworldly place. Located on the banks of a small tributary of the Limi River, the Halji Gompa is undoubtedly one of the highest temples in the world (approximately 3,600 meters). Adding to the Gompa’s ethereal qualities is its setting: Limi Valley, one of the most remote, and starkly beautiful regions of Himalayan Nepal. The Rinchenling Gompa sits inside Halji Village, one of three small communities within Limi Valley. Access to electricity and warmth are difficult here. Small solar panels, along with a miniature hydro-electric plant provide light only during specified hours of the night. Warmth is provided by burning cow dung in hearths in each of the homes. It’s that remote. Because Limi Valley is right up against the border with Tibet, the Tibetan language is spoken and Tibetan religious customs are practiced in lieu of more Nepali traditions. The Rinchenling Gompa was said to be founded by Rinchen Zangpo (958-1055), an early translator of Buddhist texts into the Tibetan language. Rinchen Zangpo was one of the fathers of the “Second Dissemination” in which Buddhism was reintroduced to Tibet by leading scholars around the beginning of the 11th century. He is said to have established over 108 temples in his lifetime alone. While it is hard to gauge the veracity of these claims, recent C-14 dating of the Vairocana statue inside the temple point to a range in the early 11th century, well within Rinchen Zangpo’s lifetime. In recent years, the Rinchenling Gompa has been threatened by flooding. In 2011, a glacial lake high above Halji Village burst, resulting in a flood that caused significant damage to many structures in Halji Village. Though no one was harmed during the flooding, the risk presented is severe. Without adequate restoration and protection, the Rinchenling Gompa is extremely susceptible to flood damages. A more serious flood could completely wash away over 1,000 years of history. International conservation organizations are starting to take notice, however, so there is some hope that the Gompa will receive the protection it deserves.  Physical fitness and experience traveling in developing countries are critical to accessing Rinchenling Gompa. It is roughly a six day walk from the nearest airstrip in Simikot over highly exposed trails. Accommodations are either the Halji Village guesthouse, or camping facilities."
68,Taragaon Museum,"Kathmandu, Nepal","This Kathmandu museum, built in an Austrian modernist style, looks like a set from Star Wars.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taragaon-museum,"For many, thinking of Kathmandu conjures images of towering pagoda-style temples and narrow streets choked with exotic, medieval era architecture. But after the city was opened to foreigners in the 1950s, Kathmandu’s landscape began to change. The Taragaon Museum not only chronicles the city’s architectural transformation, but also embodies it. Originally built as a hostel for visiting artists and scientists, the Taragaon grew into a well-known hotel that was later abandoned in the 1990s. The property was rescued by hotelier and philanthropist Arun Saraf, who also owns the adjacent Hyatt hotel, and was revived to honor Kathmandu’s architectural history. The Austrian architect Carl Pruscha, who served as a UN and UNESCO consultant to the Nepalese government, designed the Taragaon in the 1960s based on the artistic vision provided by Angur Baba Joshi. A prominent social activist, Joshi was an Oxford-educated Nepali woman who dreamed of promoting Nepal’s heritage by developing a cultural village. The resulting combination of Pruscha’s European modernism and Nepali traditions spawned a unique structure. Dark red brick dominates the museum’s design as a tribute to the dachi appa brick structures that can be found throughout Kathmandu’s historic districts. The bricks are typically used for the façades of Newari temples and palaces. The barrel-vaulted style rooms, which Pruscha calls “Pati,” were likewise inspired by classic temple architecture. Other elements of the recent restoration are distinctly modern, like the large, circular windows, which are meant as a nod toward the future. Inside, the museum is bedecked with photos, drawings, and sketches of Nepal’s architectural bounty. Two of the oldest items on display are an 1853 etching and an 1863 photograph of Kathmandu. These are complemented by colorful topographic maps and paintings as well as modern sculpture by Nepali artists.  The Taragaon Museum is on the grounds of the Hyatt hotel and is within easy walking distance from Boudha Stupa.  Entry is free."
69,Nyatapola Temple,"Bhaktapur, Nepal","Towering at a height of over 30 meters, this turn-of-the-18th-century landmark is the tallest temple in Nepal.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nyatapola-temple,"The imposing Nyatapola Temple stands five tiers tall over Taumadhi Square in the Nepalese city of Bhaktapur, where it was built with time-tested virtuosity at the behest of King Bhupatindra Malla in 1702. While the temple is indeed a splendid relic of treasured Nepalese history, the building’s structure is so solid that it withstood an 8.3 earthquake in 1934, followed by another in 2015, without any significant architectural damage. This exquisite, pagoda-style edifice comprised of wood and brick, and adorned with magnificent carvings was named Nyatapola after the local Newari words for “five-stepped” (nyata) and “roof” (pola). The building maintains associations with the deities Bhairava—a ferocious incarnation of the Lord Shiva—and, principally, Siddhi Lakshmi, the Tantric incarnation of “the invincible” goddess Durga, to whom Nyatapola is dedicated. According to local legend, at a time when Bhairava threatened civilization with annihilation, a desperate king called upon Parvati, the goddess of love, fertility, and beauty. In the form of Siddhi Lakshmi, she thwarted Bhairava with Nyatapola: a far more powerful temple than Bhairava’s neighboring shrine in Taumadhi Square. The original chapel dedicated to Bhairava was a humble construction, added to over time. The temple was destroyed in the earthquake that occurred in 1934 and had to be rebuilt, with a third tier added during reconstruction. Within the sublime Nyatapola Temple is a shrine dedicated to Siddhi Lakshmi, which is purportedly so formidable that it’s been reserved exclusively for temple priests since it was forged. Additional likenesses of Siddhi Lakshmi can be found in details across the temple—above doors and across the roof’s framework. Visitors egress the temple via a brick stairway guarded by five pairs of sculpted deities of ascending power: first, the wrestlers Jayamel and Phattu, believed to have possessed superhuman strength; followed by elephants, lions, then gryphons; and finally, just before the temple doors, the goddesses Baghini—the “Tigress,”—and Singhini—the “Lioness.” Nyatapola was one of several temples built in the states of Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kathmandu during the 18th century. Today, all three former states comprise the Kathmandu Valley, also known as the Valley of the Temples.  The Nyatapola Temple is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, though visitors to the temple during a Nepalese festival or holiday should check beforehand to make sure it's open to the public."
70,Ranibari Community Forest,"Kathmandu, Nepal",This conservation area filled with colorful birds is the last community forest within the city of Kathmandu.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ranibari-community-forest,"Long-time residents of the Kathmandu Valley often lament the concrete jungle their city has become, but one green hillock in the shadow of the Himalayan foothills has been preserved. Once the site of religious retreats for Nepal’s kings, the Ranibari Community Forest is now an oasis of nature with footpaths that explore 17 acres of densely forested parkland. The forest is most notable for the abundance of birds that make it their home, with more than 67 species regularly spotted here. Visitors can easily spy Alexandrine parakeets fluttering colorfully through the trees, black kites arguing with crows, or scarlet minivets frolicking in the canopy. And the extravagantly tailed red-billed blue magpies are one of the highlights of any birding trip to the forest. Fittingly, Bird Conservation Nepal has developed the forest as a bird and biodiversity conservation learning center. Two main trails encircle the forest, one at the base which staves off the ever encroaching city development, and one that circles the top of the hill allowing views of the city and Himalayas beyond. Also at the top of the hill is a small Ranidevi temple with murti dedicated to Shiva, Krishna, and Ganesh. Otherwise, the forest is the domain of native flora and fauna. Nepal launched the community forest program in 1973 and currently there are nearly 20,000 forests across the country. The Kathmandu Valley region has 144 community forests, but Ranibari is the only one within the boundary of the Ring Road that encircles the cities of Kathmandu and Patan. Anyone looking for a respite from the functional anarchy of Kathmandu’s crowded city center will undoubtedly find nirvana tucked in the Ranibari forest.  The forest is free to enter before 9:30 a.m., but costs the princely sum of 10 rupees thereafter."
71,Lukla Airport,"Chaurikharka, Nepal",Jumping-off point for a climb up Mt. Everest is the most dangerous airport in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lukla-airport,"The little town of Lukla is the starting point of almost all trekking journeys in the Khumbu region. Situated at an altitude of 2,860 meters, Lukla is the first site that trekkers get introduced to when visiting Khumbu. It is a collection of small houses and hotels that are scattered within proximity to the region’s only airport- the Tenzing Hillary Airport. Because of its prominence, Lukla has transformed from a small farming community to a commercial hub of the region that is on par with Namche Bazaar. Due to trekkers staying overnight at Lukla during Everest Treks, the town has seen a rise in the number of luxury guesthouses and hotels in recent years. From Kathmandu, it takes about 40 minutes to reach Lukla via plane. Also famously known as the Lukla Airport, the Tenzing Hillary Airport is a small airport that is often referred to as one of the most dangerous airports in the world. The airport is among the most famous transport connection between the rest of Nepal and the Everest Mountains, with other ways of reaching Khumbu are long days of trekking. Daily flights occur to/from the airport during daylight hours and in good weather conditions. In contrast to Kathmandu’s steady sun-shining, Lukla often experiences rainfall, sometimes simultaneously with the lack of rain in other parts of the country. Lukla’s topographical position in the mountain gives way to high winds, dense cloud cover, and changing visibility. This, as a result, often leads to flight delays or the airport being closed. The Lukla Airport was built in 1964. The construction was done under the supervision of Sir Edmund Hillary, and until recently in 2001, the airport runway wasn’t even properly paved. It was renamed in 2008 in honor of Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, the first people to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. The runway is 527 meters long and 30 meters wide and the airport is used mostly for passenger flights and the transport of goods and cargo to Lukla and other villages in the north of the region, as there is no road access. The airplanes landing or taking off from the Lukla Airport must use a single runway. High terrain blocks the already low prospect of go-around on short final airplane approaches, and the runway ends in a steeply angled drop into the valley below. As such, landing and taking off from Lukla is difficult. The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal has, as a result, set high standards for which only experienced pilots who have completed at least 100 short-takeoff-and-landing (STOL) missions are allowed to land at the airport. The pilots must also have over one year of STOL experience in Nepal and must have completed ten missions into Lukla with a certified instructor pilot. However, despite the difficulties, Lukla has one of the busiest domestic airports in Nepal. Accidents happen rarely, and the airport is considered one of the most beautiful airports in the world. It is surrounded by the mighty Himalayas and the towering emerald hills that shadow over the village. There is no use of air navigation or radar systems. Instead, for landing and take-offs, radio communication is used. The paved road is small and is only suitable for helicopters and small aircraft with fixed wings and short takeoffs.Landing at the Tenzing Hillary Airport begins from north to south, and takeoff is from south to north of the runway. Furthermore, the runway is secured by the Nepal Army and has a wired fence around it. Despite notoriously having the reputation as the most dangerous airport in the world, the Lukla Airport carried out about 20 or 30 aircraft landings every day during the peak seasons. Almost more than half the trekkers who visit Nepal annually tend to fly into Lukla. While the airport at Lukla is comparatively more dangerous statistically than a typical commercial airport, it is still pretty safe. The aviation officials of Nepal and local airlines are very strict on the acceptable flight conditions and regulations for aircraft making the journey to Lukla.  There are options available for trekking to Everest without flying. The alternate options include trekking to Lukla either from Jiri, Salleri or Kharihola. However, trekking to Lukla instead of flying takes about 3 to 8 days. Due to Lukla’s position and elevation, weather conditions and visibility are constantly dynamic and can change rapidly. Thus, flight schedules to Lukla can be difficult and are hard to predict. The airlines do not take chances with weather conditions and will return a flight to Kathmandu from anywhere along its journey rather than risk an unsafe landing if the weather conditions change since takeoff. As such, flight delays are very common. They can happen at any time of year but are especially likely to occur during the monsoon season (late May to early September). If your flight is delayed, then you will have to reschedule the next possible flight. Travel agencies take care of rescheduling for you if you are hiring them for treks. As conditions at Lukla can change so rapidly, rescheduling may be very soon after your scheduled departure, or it may take as much as a few days later- it is very difficult to predict. This, of course, can be pretty frustrating, but it is simply a part of the journey to the Everest region. It is strongly recommended to add at least a day or two to the end of the trip for flexibility in case of any delays. Extra days should always be scheduled at the end of the trip as this provides flexibility with the trekking itinerary in case of any weather delays.  You can get a cab in Kathmandu to get to the Tribhuvan International Airport. The cab fare can cost about NPR 1000. It is recommended to get to the airport at least one hour before your flight time."
72,Island Jungle Resort at Chitwan National Park,"Manahari, Nepal",Everything from a plane to your own two feet are needed to reach this jungle resort.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/island-jungle-resort-chitwan-national-park,"If you’re visiting Kathmandu, but need an escape from the bustling capital, the Island Jungle Resort in the Chitwan National Park is the place to go. Simply hop on a plane to Bharatpur (a more rural town), where the Lodge’s bus will pick you up and take you to their hotel for a hot buffet of Nepali food. At this point you might wonder if you’ve been ripped off, with the only “jungle-like” qualities being the hotel’s very green courtyard. But just wait. Once you finish your meal, you will be instructed to re-board the Lodge’s bus for a one-hour ride that goes through the hustle-bustle of Bharatpur to the surrounding villages, then the rural villages, barren fields, swampy areas, and then finally stops at what seems to be the final destination, a river. Here you will find a canoe waiting for you, that will take you across the river to meet your final guide, who leads you on a 10 minute walk through butterfly gardens to an oasis of huts, elephant rides, nature walks, and a full bar/restaurant, which make up the Island Jungle Resort. After the use of a plane, bus, canoe and your own two feet, you are finally there."
73,Buddha Peace Park,"Mahamanjushree Nagarkot, Nepal",This park in Nagarkot boasts one of the best views in all of Nepal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buddha-peace-park,"An hour east of Kathmandu is the small resort community of Nagarkot. The road to reach the town is steep, twisty, and rough, making a stop at the Buddha Peace Park a welcome respite. Hikers may choose to finish the journey to Nagarkot by taking the eight-kilometer Peace Park Hiking Trail into town. The trail offers even more panoramic views of the Kathmandu Valley and the Himalayas beyond. Carved out of the side of the Himalayan foothills, the park can be reached by climbing a series of steep steps, but the vista is well worth the effort. Buddha looks over a valley with Kathmandu on one side, and the dazzling curvilinear striations of extensive terrace farms on the other. Behind the park, at the top of the hill, and above the clouds, the Himalayas are on full display. The golden statue positioned on the central plinth is a depiction of the “Earth Touching Buddha,” also known as the Buddha exhibiting the “Bhumisparsha Mudra.” In this pose, Buddha’s right-hand reaches toward the ground, and his middle finger touches the ground symbolizing the moment of his enlightenment. According to the backstory, while Buddha was meditating under a Bodhi tree, he was harangued by the demon Mara. Buddha called to the earth goddess to witness his enlightenment. The goddess responded by sending a flood to wash away Mara and allow Buddha to complete his spiritual journey. The earthly landscape surrounding Buddha is covered in picturesque terraced farms. In a country where crop yields are low and food insecurity is high, more than 13 million Nepalese depend on sustainable terrace farming. When viewed from a distance, the beauty and romance of the farms hide the incredibly hard work it takes to create and maintain the fields—work that is done entirely by hand and mostly by women. The nearby town of Nagarkot provides luxury hotel accommodations, as well as views of six of the world’s 14 highest mountain peaks. A special viewing platform was constructed specifically to watch the sunrise over Everest. Here, meditating visitors can replicate Buddha’s earth goddess invocation and absorb the unrivaled views.  The park is free to visit and is open 24 hours. If visitors are so inclined, they may plant a tree in the park in honor of a special occasion or in memory of a loved one. The cost is modest, $3-$4, and the park will nurture it to maturity."
74,Mangyongdae Funfair,"Pyongyang, North Korea",This abandoned-looking amusement park is frighteningly open for business.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mangyongdae-funfair,"The Mangyongdae Funfair is an amusement park in Mangyongdae-guyok. And though crowds are sparse, it refuses to close its doors. Most of the rides in this rickety operation seem to be falling apart at the seams, though the roller coaster, merry-go-round, and train ride are functional. Local farmers regularly test the rides. Allegedly, when foreign journalists visit the park, they are commonly kept on a bus until local residents can be rounded up to make the place look at least a little bit livelier. It’s also said that these foreign visitors are allowed to go on the rides first, for publicity purposes. While the local-tested rides are bundles of fun, it’s not all rusty carousels and roller coasters. You can also enjoy some good, old-fashioned amusement park fun at the shooting gallery, where everyone gets the chance to enjoy taking aim at some imperialist aggressors. Kim Jong-un inspected the park in 2011, and needless to say, Supreme Commander was not pleased. He ordered the park to be cleaned up and brought to the standards of the Songun era, with the “Military First” ideology that officials serve the people. No word on any improvements being made just yet."
75,Ryugyong Hotel,"Pyongyang, North Korea","North Korea's massive ""hotel of doom.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ryugyong-hotel,"This 300-meter-high skyscraper would be an imposing presence in any city’s skyline. In Pyongyang, North Korea it dwarfs every other structure in sight, dominating not only the skyline but the city itself. It is North Korea’s largest building, and yet it remains for the moment, unfinished. In 1986, a South Korean Group completed the construction of the 226-meter-tall Westin Stamford Hotel in Singapore, at the time the most ambitious construction project ever undertaken by a Korean company. The communist leadership of the North wanted to prove that its own engineers were capable of constructing a building on an even more grandiose scale. Baekdu Mountain Architects & Engineers started construction on the tower in 1987. Its name translates to “capital of willows” and it was a historic moniker of Pyongyang. The building consists of three triangular sections, each 100 meters long. The sections converge at the summit, giving an overall pyramidal outline to the structure. It is a gigantic building containing roughly 360,000 square meters, roughly 67 football fields, of floor space. At the apex of the hotel is a 40-meter-tall, eight-floor conical structure, which was supposed to house seven revolving restaurants. The hotel’s original plans called for 3,000 rooms, as well as plenty of space for additional commercial venues. According to the original plan, the hotel was supposed to open in 1989, however, construction problems forced the government to postpone its opening several times. In the early 1990s, multiple problems hit the project. Poor quality materials, electricity shortages, and a widespread famine in the country all became serious obstacles to the completion of the building. Expected foreign investments never materialized. Finally, in 1992, construction was halted. Japanese sources estimate that over the course of its construction, the project swallowed over two percent of North Korea’s GDP, or roughly 750 million US dollars. The hotel’s empty shell was left standing empty for 16 years. Due to the financial burden the project placed on the already starving nation, and the drab and menacing look of the naked concrete structure, foreign media dubbed the hotel the “World’s Worst Building” and the “Hotel of Doom.” Nevertheless, work resumed in 2008, and a slick glass facade was installed and finished by 2011. The new official date for the opening of the Hotel was set for 2012, on the 100th anniversary of the birth of the Great Leader Kim Il Sung. Plans ground to a halt for a second time in March 2013, when the company that expressed interest in running the hotel pulled out; likely in response to North Korea’s nuclear tests. As of 2016, the building remains closed."
76,North Korea's International Friendship Exhibition Hall,"North Pyongan Province, North Korea",A bizarre collection of gifts to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il from the despots of the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/north-koreas-international-friendship-exhibition-hall,"If you are an iron-fisted despot or terrorist organization, what do you get another tyrannical dictator as a gift? It would seem, judging from North Korea’s “International Friendship Exhibition Hall” that going with a dead animal is always a safe bet. Located in the UN recognized biosphere reserve of Mount Myohyang, North Korea’s “International Friendship Exhibition Hall” is an exercise in contradictions. First off, for North Korea, one of the most isolated countries in the world, having an “International Friendship Exhibition Hall” itself is a bit of a contradiction. In essence, it amounts to an enormous collection of gifts given to Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong Il by various other communist, terrorist, and despotic regimes. Among the over 100,000 items gifted to the Kims are: Green railway cars from Mao and Stalin, a bronze tank from the USSR headquarters in East Germany, a gold cigarette case from Yugoslavia’s Tito,a 25-watt boombox from the People’s Republic of China Communist Party which seems kind of cheap, considering, a gem-encrusted silver sword and reproduction of a Moslem mosque from Palestinian leader Yassar Arafat, and an antique gramophone from China’s first premier Zhou Enlai. This isn’t to say the US has never given anything. Yet another of the contradictions of the “International Friendship Exhibition Hall” is that gifts have indeed been given by the democratic western world, albeit only a few, and are proudly displayed. The circumstances of the gifts from the US are unknown and probably date to Kim Il Sung’s era, but include a book, vase, and mirror, three pewter and silver pieces, and two homemade art objects. One can’t help but wonder who made these “art objects” and what they could possibly be. Among the other gifts from the west is a basketball signed by Micheal Jordan, and given (for what reason it is unclear) by Madeleine Albright. One of the more bizarre gifts are perfect copies of the black limousine cruisers seen in “The Untouchables” from Soviet leaders Georgy Malenkov and Nikolai Bulganina. Obviously less concerned with impressing North Korea, Gorbachev sent only a Glass vase with the Communist star on it. Mongolia sent silver chopsticks, while the Chairman of the Journalist Association of Kuwait sent a pen set. From various Industrialists trying to woo Kim Jong Il: a robot drink server, wooden mace, astronaut’s suit, Sony Walkman, Casio keyboard, Yamaha organ, football signed by Pele, and an old Apple computer – which seems like someone might have just been getting rid of their trash – and once again with a somewhat unimpressive display, a tiny rubber ashtray from the Hwabei Tire Factory in China. But by far the most popular theme for gifts given by one dictator to another is taxidermy. Fidel Castro gave a crocodile-skin briefcase, and Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator who was overthrown and killed by his own people, gave a bear head mounted on a red satin pillow. Lebanon gave Water buffalo-horn handles and the president of Tanzania gave an ivory lion. The National Black United Front gave Kim a small butterfly collection, at some point Canada gave North Korea a polar bear skin, and someone gave a tiger claw positioned as to be tearing through an American map. Of course, the most creative and unusual of the gifts belongs not to a dictator or even a head of state, but naturally, a revolutionary. The Sandinistas of Nicaragua donated an upright grinning alligator, holding out a wooden tray of cocktail glasses. It comes with a matching ashtray. While to an outsider the museum represents a bizarre collection, with a remarkable amount of kitsch, ashtrays, and uninteresting consumer goods, it is not outsiders that are the intended audience. North Koreans have almost no contact with the outside world, and this is one place in which they are allowed to see many of the goods from around the world. The aim is to convince them that their leaders are universally admired and lavished with gifts. One of the hall’s guards is quoted as having noted the basketball signed by Micheal Jordan and saying “When the general plays with that ball, it proves that he controls the whole world in his hands.” For that North Korean Guard, Kim Jong Un, like his father and grandfather, really does hold the whole world in his hands."
77,Mansu Hill Grand Monument,"Pyongyang, North Korea",A giant bronze monument to Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il is one of the most sacred sites in North Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mansu-hill-grand-monument,"On Mansu Hill in North Korea’s capital city, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il stand a staggering 20 meters of bronze. This memorial monument allows the Great Leaders—who are immortal in the eyes of the people—to be remembered forever. It is one of the most sacred places in the DPRK. As such, visitors are expected to show the correct visiting etiquette—purchasing flowers to lay at the giant statues’ feet, marching in solemn line, hand by your sides and bowing. Photographs of just part of the monument are forbidden and considered insulting; photos must be framed to include the entire monument. Kim Il-sung—the one with his arm outstretched away from the 70-meter-wide mosaic of Mount Paektu— was the original monument, unveiled in 1972 to celebrate the leader’s 60th birthday. (Reportedly the statue was originally covered in gold leaf, but was changed to the less expensive bronze at the insistence of China.)  After his death, the leader’s son, Kim Jong-il joined him in bronze. On either side of the two Great Leaders, there are enormous stones with KWP flags and 228 bronze figures all standing at 5 meters high. This sculpture is symbolic of the socialist revolution and the struggle against North Korea’s imperialist enemies, the Japanese. The American enemies are not forgotten either; they have a slogan dedicated to them: “Let us drive out US imperialism and reunify the country.”"
78,The USS Pueblo,"Pyongyang, North Korea","Captured in 1968, the Cold War spy ship is the only U.S. Navy vessel being held by a foreign government.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-uss-pueblo-pyongyang-north-korea,"The U.S.S. Pueblo is an American intelligence-gathering ship captured by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on January 23, 1968. The “Pueblo Crisis” was a major incident in the Cold War but remained little-known, as it was overshadowed a week later by the Tet Offensive attacks of the Vietnam War. At the time of the capture, North Korea stated that the ship had strayed into their territorial waters, but the United States maintained that the vessel was in international waters. The Pueblo was initially approached by a submarine chaser and its nationality challenged. The Pueblo responded by raising the U.S. flag. The DPRK vessel then ordered the crew to stand down or be fired upon. The Pueblo attempted to move away but was attacked by the sub chaser, three torpedo boats, and two MiG-21 fighter aircraft. The Pueblo was taken into port at Wonsan and the crew moved to POW camps; upon their release, some of the crew stated that they had been starved and regularly tortured while in North Korean custody. This treatment had worsened when the North Koreans realized that their prisoners were secretly giving them the finger in staged propaganda photos. Commander Lloyd M. Bucher, Commanding Officer of the Pueblo, was tortured and put through a mock firing squad ordeal in an effort to make him confess. Eventually the North Koreans threatened to execute his men in front of him, and Bucher relented. On December 23, 1968—exactly 11 months after being taken prisoner—the crew was taken by buses to the DMZ border with South Korea and ordered to walk south across the “Bridge of No Return.” The Pueblo officially remains a commissioned vessel of the United States Navy and is currently moored along the Taedong River in Pyongyang. It is the only ship of the U.S. Navy currently being held “captive” and is now used as a war museum. Tours are officially conducted by military guides who refer to Americans as “U.S. Imperialist Aggressors,” and a propaganda video is shown prior to commencement of the tour in case any doubt remains. As with most sites of interest in North Korea this has to be organised officially. Photos are allowed from on board the vessel (including of the guides and .50 cal guns) but not of the exterior from the dock."
79,Taedonggang Brewing Company,"Pyongyang, North Korea",An English brewery transported to North Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taedonggang-brewing-company,"The team first arrived in the rural English town of Trowbridge in the summer of 2000. There were two brewers, two engineers, and eight government officials. They were all from North Korea, and they had come to take the brewery. Their leader, Kim Jong Il (nicknamed “Kim Jong Ale” by the residents of Trowbridge), had recently decided that North Korea needed a better state-run brewery. But instead of building a brewery from scratch, the North Korean leader decided to go shopping for one. For £1.5 million, North Korea bought the 175-year-old Ushers of Trowbridge Brewery. A team of Russians came in to entirely dismantle the brick-walled factory, then the North Koreans shipped all four million pounds of it back to Pyongyang. The crew left nothing, taking every vat, keg, pipe, nut, bolt, tile, and toilet seat in the brewery. They wanted to take the brewmaster himself, but had to settle for just his knowledge. Korean translators spent weeks with him poring over beer-making schematics. A mere 18 months later, in 2002, the Russian team had reassembled the factory on a cabbage field in East Pyongyang. Since named the Taedonggang Brewing Company, the brewery produced seven styles of beer, named pragmatically from light pilsner “Beer Number One” (“Taedonggang 1”) to dark, chocolatey dunkel “Beer Number Seven.” (They have since added at least one more.) Taedonggang is considered some of the best beer available on the Korean Peninsula, and even within Asia. Despite the improved state-run brewing game, most North Koreans still prefer cheaper, harder stuff such as the local liquor, soju. Rural North Koreans must use food rations to buy beer, which makes it a luxury item few can afford. In the country’s capital, men receive beer vouchers (usually 1–2 liters a month) that can be redeemed in a Pyongyang bar. But for the most part, beer is still an urban, middle-class affair, more akin to a nice glass of wine than a party beverage. Although North Korea and the Taedonggang Brewing Company would like the world to focus on their surprisingly good beer, the brewery still remains the property of a mysterious and harsh dictatorship. In 2016, Pyongyang held its first-ever beer festival, which attracted 45,000 visitors. In 2017, however, the festival was canceled by the government without explanation.  For foreigners, your best bet is checking for tour operators that visit the brewery. Otherwise, Taedonggang's beers can sometimes be found—depending on the state of sanctions and international relations—in grocery stores in countries such as China."

In true DPRK fashion, the symbolism does not stop there. Because it was erected for the 50th anniversary of the Workers’ Party, the monument is precisely 50 meters (165 feet) tall. Not only that, the number of bricks around its belt symbolise the date of Kim Jung II’s birth. It reads “Long live the Workers’ Party of Korea, the organizer and guide of all victories of the Korean people.” Inside the monument there are three large bronze pictures that represent the roots of the party, the unity of the people and the party’s vision. Do not walk ahead of your guards - although hidden from sight there are military personnel stationed here and they are not shy about coming out to shout at you if you get a little ahead of yourself!"

There’s much more to Juche; it has been credited with creating the cult of personality surrounding North Korean leaders. It would later become known by another name: “Kimilsung-ism.” The Juche Tower was built in 1982 on the banks of the Taedong River in celebration of Kim Il-sung’s 70th birthday. As everything in North Korea is symbolic, the Juche Tower makes no exception. It’s comprised of 25,550 blocks—one for every day of Il-sung’s life. Some have even said that he was the architect of the grand monument to his own philosophy, but this is unlikely. The monolithic structure is reminiscent of the United States’ Washington Monument, and in fact, Juche Tower is considered to be in direct competition with the famed Washington, D.C. monument, as it is exactly one meter taller than the American obelisk. This makes it one of the highest monuments in the world, second only to Houston’s San Jacinto Monument. The tower is a popular tourist destination, where visitors can ride to the top in an elevator to view Pyongyang from above. For the heights-avoidant, there are videos displayed at the base of the tower explaining the monument’s significance to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, to the philosophy of Juche, and to Eternal Leader Kim Il-sung."

This is the image of Chollima, one of the most important symbols in North Korea. Located in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, the towering statue is a monument to Korean workers, the symbol of which crowns the monument. The symbol itself is of Chinese origin, a magical horse that is so fast, no man can mount it, being an Eastern allegory to the pegasus. The name even translates to “thousand-mile horse.” The symbol was introduced to North Korea by in 1956 by Kim Il-Sung, who used it as the mascot for his Chollima Workers Movement. The country was in need of rapid reconstruction following the Korean War, and Il Sung used the slogan, “Let us dash forward in the spirit of Chollima!” to invoke the mythical creature’s speed and perseverance over seemingly impossible goals. The campaign seemed to work too, leading to years of rapid reconstruction. Unfortunately, people are not magical tireless horses, and by the 1960s the movement had petered out for the most part. However, the Chomilla remains a popular icon in the country, even lending its name to the national football team. There are small versions of the statue to be found all over the country, but the main Chollma Statue in Pyongyang was built in 1961 and stands over 150 feet tall.

86,Arch of Triumph,"Pyongyang, North Korea",Pyongyang’s Arch of Triumph is the second tallest triumphal arch in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arch-of-triumph,"The Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang, North Korea was modeled on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but was built to be just a little bit taller than its French counterpart. The Arch of Triumph was officially opened on April 15, 1982 to mark the 70th birthday of Kim Il-sung, the first leader of North Korea. It was President Kim Il-sung who, according to North Korean history, led the Korean resistance to Japan from 1925 to 1945 (although he was only 13 in 1925). The arch was built on the site of Kim’s triumphant return to Pyongyang in 1945, marking the end of the Japanese occupation of the city. The Arch of Triumph is a vast structure, its imposing nature only enhanced by the relative isolation in which it sits, alone on an expansive square surrounded by roads that see little traffic. At 197 feet (60 m) high and 164 feet (50 m) wide, it’s the second tallest triumphal arch in the world after the Monumento a la Revolución in Mexico City. It’s also 33 feet taller than the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, upon which it was undoubtedly modeled. The arch is steeped in symbolism, with references to the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, the Korean nation and, of course, Kim Il-sung. The structure is apparently made from 25,500 blocks of white granite, each one representing a day in the life of President Kim Il-sung up to his 70th birthday. On either side of the arch are the dates 1925 and 1945, referring to the period during which Kim spent in resistance to the Japanese. Also inscribed on the arch are the words of the revolutionary hymn “Song of General Kim Il-sung,” and 70 azalea reliefs representing each year of Kim’s life. Bronze statues on the arch pay homage to the three pillars of the Workers’ Party of Korea, showing workers, farmers and the intelligentsia, and the soldiers who fought for the Korean Revolutionary Army. Also represented is Mount Paektu, a sacred mountain that played a part in the fight against Japanese occupation (Kim Il-sung organized his resistance in the dense forests surrounding the mountain). Inside the Arch of Triumph, meanwhile, are a series of viewing platforms and rooms connected by elevators and stairs. From the top, visitors have impressive views across the surrounding neighborhood, Kim Il-sung Stadium and Moranbong Park.  The Arch of Triumph is located at the intersection of Moranbong Street, Chilsungmun Street and Kaesonmun Street in the Moranbong Distict of Pyongyang. The Kaeson Metro Station is located nearby. Some tourist buses coming from the airport into Pyongyang stop at the arch to let visitors have a quick walk around. Alternatively, you can arrange a tour to the arch once in Pyongyang. The Arch of Triumph is open every day. Entrance to the rooms and viewing points inside the arch costs about $5 US. Check your nation’s travel advisory for any warnings before traveling to North Korea."
87,Mohenjo-Daro,"Moenjodaro, Pakistan",This lost city belongs to one of the earliest civilizations in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mohenjodaro,"Contemporaneous with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley Civilization was, as the name suggests, centered around the Indus River basin. However, little was known about this ancient culture until the 1920s, when a couple of long-buried cities were first excavated by modern archaeologists. One of these rediscovered sites was Mohenjo-Daro. The name Mohenjo-Daro, meaning “Mound of the Dead Men,” is a modern one, as the original city was anything but. Spreading over an area of 300 hectares (about 750 acres) with a peak population of about 40,000, Mohenjo-Daro was one of the largest and most advanced cities in the world during its time. Laid out in a rectilinear grid and built out of baked bricks, the city featured a complex water management system, complete with a sophisticated drainage and covered sewer system, and baths in nearly every house. The original name of the city is forgotten, although one scholar speculates it may have been Kukkutarma, or “The City of the Cockerel” (a.k.a., Rooster City). The uniform size of the manufactured bricks used to build Mohenjo-Daro, the discovery of standardized weights and measures used to facilitate trade, the considerable degree of civil engineering and urban planning evident in the city’s development, and the fact these characteristics are shared with other Indus-Sarasvati Valley sites (most notably Harappa, the first site to be excavated) suggest a highly organized civilization with bureaucratic coordination of things like construction and commerce. Given that, it is perhaps puzzling to note that Mohenjo-Daro does not seem to feature any palaces, temples, monuments, or anything else indicative of a seat of governing power. The city’s largest structures are things like public baths (including one that had an underground furnace to heat the pools), assembly halls, a marketplace, ancient apartment buildings, and the aforementioned sewer system — all things that suggest an emphasis on an orderly, clean, and modest civil society. Built around 2500 BCE, Mohenjo-Daro — like the rest of the Indus Valley Civilization — went into sudden decline for unknown reasons in 1900 BCE and was subsequently abandoned possibly because of the drying up of a major Sarawati River. After its rediscovery in the 1920s, a few decades of excavations were ultimately discovered to be exposing the ancient structures to considerably weather damage, and all further archaeological work on the site was halted in 1966; today, only salvage excavations, surface surveys, and conservation projects are allowed."
88,Attabad Lake,"Hunza Nagar, Pakistan",This dazzlingly turquoise mountain lake was created in the wake of a natural disaster.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/attabad-lake,"On January 4, 2010, a massive landslide thundered down the sides of the remote Hunza Valley in the Gilgit Baltistan Region of Northern Pakistan. The village of Attabad was buried, killing 20 people and destroying 26 homes. The disaster, however, was far from over. The landslide had dammed the Hunza River, and the rapidly rising waters of the newly formed lake threatened villages both below and above the dam. The waters behind the newly formed natural dam soon rose to a depth of more than 300 feet, creating a lake that eventually measured 13 miles in length. As the lake grew, it displaced some 6,000 people from upstream villages and flooded a 12-mile stretch of the Karakoram Highway, leaving the region stranded. In May 2010, local authorities excavated a spillway to guide the flow over the dam. A month later, however, too much water was flowing over the landslide. Below the dam, lower Shishkat was completely submerged and Gulmit partly flooded. By August 2010, the spillway was beginning to perform well. But by that time, as many as 25,000 individuals had been affected, either as a result of the initial landslide, flooding, or due to the destruction of the highway. The government provided aid to the victims, but many remained in fear of further disaster. If the dam burst, 50,000 people living downstream could be in peril, as well as a road that served as an important trade link with China. Thankfully, the dam held. And from the disaster came an unexpected attraction that would eventually lead to a tourism boom in the area: Attabad Lake, a shimmering turquoise lake that is now one of the main attractions in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. The lake’s chilly waters are a stunning turquoise in spring and early summer, when meltwater from the surrounding mountains deposits glacial silt into the lake. In winter, the lake typically freezes over. Most visitors come to enjoy this spectacular landscape when the lake is ice-free. Various recreational activities take place on and around the lake, including boating, jet skiing, and fishing. And with the rise in tourism, an increasing number of hotels and guesthouses have sprung up around the lake, as well as a handful of campsites. Presumably, the influx of tourists has benefited many of the locals who were affected by the landslide. And now that the highway has been rebuilt with new tunnels, access is better than it was before. Still, if you take a boat out onto the calm surface of Attabad Lake, it’s strange to think that 300 meters below you sits a once-lively village. Now Attabad lake is one of the top tourist attraction points in Pakistan. However, with the level of water rising, the government of Pakistan is planning to build a dam around the lake.  Attabad Lake is about half an hour east of Karimabad, the capital of the Hunza District in the Gilgit-Baltistan province of Pakistan (Karimabad, incidentally, was named one of the five ""Best Tourist Sites"" in Pakistan by The Guardian). If you arrive independently, you can arrange trips on the lake with local guides or in Karimabad. Most boat trips tend to last at least an hour. Alternatively, you can organize five-day tours from Islamabad, which often include the Hunza Valley, Attabad Lake, and the Pakistan-China border region."
89,Chaukhandi Tombs,"Karachi, Pakistan",Reputedly haunted sandstone necropolis with exquisite stone carvings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chaukhandi-tombs,"If you’re going to bury someone above ground, the container should probably be both secure and reverent. This knowledge seems to be almost instinctive, as ornate tombs and mausoleums can be found sheltering bodies above the surface in cemeteries from New Orleans to Timbuktu. The most famous of these tombs are clearly the great pyramids of Egypt, but other examples of respectful celebration through decoration are found the world over. The Chaukhandi Tombs near Karachi, Pakistan are a unique example of such burials. Buried south to north – unusual for the area and time period – these tombs are constructed out of huge sandstone slabs, which are delicately stacked into a finessed pyramid shape. The slabs were then clearly painstakingly carved with intricate patterns, drawings and relatable scenes. Built between the 15th and 18th centuries, the Chaukhandi Tombs now form a remarkably well-preserved necropolis that often attracts curious visitors and archeologists alike, but the area is not without foreboding legends. Beyond the elaborate decoration of the tombs, another feature the tombs seem to share with similar necropoli around the world is the conviction locals tend to have that the area is haunted. The tombs at Chaukhandi are renowned for being one of the most haunted sites in the region, and visitors are particularly warned against entering the graveyard at night. Avoiding the tombs at night isn’t bad advice, haunting or otherwise, because the details and drawings on these fascinating artifices are clearly best experienced in the broad light of day. A fact for which many visitors are likely very thankful."
90,Khewra Salt Mines,"Khewra, Pakistan","The world's second largest salt mine, said to have been discovered by Alexander the Great's horse.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khewra-salt-mines,"In 326 BC, Alexander the Great, the Greek King famous for conquering an empire ranging from Asia into Africa and Europe, was making his way across Pakistan. Stopping his army for a rest in the area now known as Khewra, Alexander’s horse began licking the stones on the ground. Seeing that all the horses were doing so and taking note, a soldier himself tried one and found that the rocks were quite salty. The Khewra salt deposits had been discovered. Today, some 2330 years later, the Khewra salt mines are the second largest in the world — behind the Sifto Canada, Inc., salt mine in Goderich, Ontario — turning out 325,000 tons of salt per year, and an estimated 220 million tons over its lifetime. This is barely even a dent in the massive salt stores here, which are said to be 6.687 billion tons. Officially, salt mining wasn’t recorded until the 1200s under the Janjua-Raja’ tribe, but salt has probably been mined and traded here since Alexander’s time. Covering an area of 110 sq. km, 228 meters or 748 feet deep (with 11 separate stories), the massive mine has over 40 kilometers of tunnels running some 730 meters, or nearly half a mile into the mountain under which the salt deposits are found. To keep the huge space from collapsing in on itself, only fifty percent of the salt found is mined; the other half serves as support columns to hold up the mine. With such a massive area, a large workforce, and the ease of carving and building with salt bricks, some interesting sights have been built within the salt mine. Among the earliest structure built within the mine is the small Badshahi Mosque, complete with a small salt minaret. Built more recently, specifically to attract tourists, are small salt versions of the Great Wall of China, the Mall road of Murree, Lahore’s Shimla hill, and the Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore. Both the mosque and the miniatures are built from salt bricks, which vary in color from red to pink to white, and which are now lighted electrically and radiate a beautiful warm glow. At times, the many colors and bricks of light give the mine a sort of disco-Yellow-Brick-Road look. Other sights — and there are many — include a 75-meter-tall “assembly hall” chamber with stairs spiraling up the walls, a 25-foot-long Salt Bridge called the Pul-saraat (an allusion to the Islamic “Pul-e-Saraat,” a bridge you must cross on Judgment Day which is described as “thinner than a strand of hair and sharper than a sword”), brine ponds, and beautiful salt-crystal formations such as stalactites. Much of this can be seen from the narrow gauge electric railway, in place since the 1930s, which once extracted salt from the mines and now brings tourists into them. The Khewra salt mine even has its own fully functioning postal office, for use by the workers. The post office is built entirely from salt bricks and is the only post office built out of salt in the world. While a popular tourist destination today, the salt mines were the scene of brutal oppression and forced work by the British in the 1800s. Miners were locked into the mines and not allowed to leave until they fulfilled their quotas. This included pregnant women and children, and a number of children were born within the mine. Strikes were met with violence from the British, and in 1876, twelve minors were shot and killed at the entrance to the mines. Their graves can be seen at the middle gates of the mines. One can taste the output of this salt mine by going to their local grocery and looking for “Himalayan Salt,” a reddish or pink rock salt. It is significantly more delicious then your average table salt, and comes with a much more interesting back story. Motorway M2:The fastest way to reach Khewra mines is via motorway M2. The mines are located 30km east of Lilla interchange towards Pind Dadan Khan. Road signs are quite visible. Highway N5: A slower but scenic approach is also available from GT road?from Mandra.?Distances?from Mandra (0km)are:?Chakwal (63km), Choa Saidan Shah (93km) and Khewra (103km). There are two trains daily between Malakwal Jn and Khewra which cover 27km distance in exact 1 hour. You have to change trains at Malakwal Jn which is connected to Lala Musa Jn on mainline at one end and Sargodha Jn at other. There are 6 daily trains on this Lala Musa - Malakwal - Sargodha route."
91,Makli Hill,"Thatta, Pakistan",One of the largest necropolises in the world is home to a stunning array of historic Middle Eastern tombs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/makli-hill,"Dominating an area over 26,000 feet in diameter atop a Pakistan hilltop, the aptly named Makli Hill is a sprawling city of the dead that is made of beautifully crumbling tombs. From around the 14th century through to the 18th century CE, the Thatta region was inhabited by local royalty who used Makli Hill as their communal burial site. Each new succession of rulers would build elaborate burial structures, often differing wildly from one another, creating a massive and varied cornucopia of historic graves unlike anything else on the planet. Kings, queens, scholars, holy men, and other figures of import are buried on the hilltop in their ornate stone tombs. Around 120,000 people are thought to be buried on the hill. Hindu, Islamic, Asian, and other styles can be picked out among the collection of tombs, which have been split into four distinct periods of creation corresponding to the ruling society of the time. Some of the tombs have tall columns, while others are decorated with sweeping arches. All together, the hill is like some sort of archaeological dreamscape. The site, while in need of a great deal of preservation, is able to be visited by tourists and necropolis fans. The latter especially will not be disappointed."
92,Lahore Fort Elephant Path,"Lahore, Pakistan",These stairs were built to accommodate royals mounted on elephants.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lahore-fort-elephant-path,"Because it would be a shame to leave one’s elephant parked outside the citadel, the magnificent Lahore Fort in Pakistan features an entranceway crafted for an entire pachyderm parade. As the Mughal Empire expanded across the Indian subcontinent in the 16th century, Lahore became an increasingly important stronghold. Its strategic location was key in tying the expanded Mughal territories to the fortified cities of Kabul, Multan, and Kashmir. The city’s fortress was built under the reign of Emperor Akbar between 1566-1605 and housed several Mughal (and later Sikh) rulers over the following centuries. The two sections of the fort are divided by usage - an administrative portion and a residential portion. The elephant stairs (or Hathi Paer) are part of the private entrance to the royal quarters, and effectively allowed royalty to ascend all the way to the doorway before dismounting. In order to accommodate the lumbering creatures, the stairs were designed with wide treads, but minimal height (a balking elephant can really dampen the mood of a procession). Although it’s been centuries since a herd of jewel and silk-laden elephants travelled several abreast along this sloping corridor, it was once certainly the most magnificent driveway in the world."
93,Tomb of Ali Mardan Khan,"Lahore, Pakistan","This grand Pakistani mausoleum can only be accessed via an almost 1,000 foot long alleyway.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tomb-of-ali-mardan-khan,"The grand Tomb of Ali Mardan Khan has stood for centuries as a lovely funerary monument for the Mughal-era governor. While it was once surrounded by a lush garden, it now sites largely forgotten surrounded by industrial rail yards. Adding to the sense of melancholy, the side is only accessible via a macabre passageway lined by barbwire cutting across rail yards. Originally built around the 1650s, the tomb holds the remains of Ali Mardan Khan, a former governor in the region. Before being buried in his lovely, octagonal tomb, Khan governed the areas of Kashmir, Lahore and Kabul in the mid-1600s. The large brick tomb had actually been prepared for Khan’s mother, but when he died in 1657, and was buried adjacent to her inside, the tomb came to bear his name. At the time of its construction, it likely stood in the middle of a richly attended paradise garden, like many similar tombs. In its original form, the tomb was likely covered in colorful decoration, but time has taken its toll on the tomb, and the exterior is now a uniform brick color that belies its construction. Nonetheless, the iconic dome on top of the structure. and it’s decorative columns still stand. Even inside, the actual tomb, which lays below ground level, is often surrounded by offerings left by visitors. Local rumor has it that Khan was considered a holy man, and many refer to the tomb as his shrine. Today, the garden is long gone, and the site of the historic tomb is surrounded on all sides by railway yards. In order to keep people out of the yards, but still allow access to the tomb, an almost 1000 foot long passageway was created out of unbroken brick walls that enclose a narrow alleyway path. While it seems like a drab entrance to such a grand tomb, it manages to make actually arriving at the site all the more impressive.  This monument is located behind the fruit market at Shalimar Road near Gulabi Chowki in Mughalpura Lahore"
94,Hussaini Suspension Bridge,"Hussaini, Pakistan","Known as the most dangerous bridge in the world, the Hussaini Hanging Bridge is only one of many precarious rope bridges in Northern Pakistan.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hussaini-hanging-bridge,"UPDATE: It is believed this bridge was washed away in a 2011 monsoon storm. In a world of commercial space flight and supersonic jet flight, it can be easy to forget just how hard it can be to traverse certain parts of this planet. But those living in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Northern Pakistan were cut off from the rest of Pakistan until 1978 due to the mountainous terrain and lack of roads. You could take a small airplane, but that was reserved for only the richest citizens. For everyone else, the only way to travel was by walking across mountain passes to Rawalpindi. In 1978, the Karakoram Highway was completed and the region was connected, but inter-region travel remains as difficult as it was 100 years ago. Regular aspects of travel through this region include the rickety cable and plank bridges that cross Northern Pakistan’s mountain streams and rivers. Among these is the Hussaini Hanging Bridge, crossing Borit Lake in the Upper Hunza. This rope bridge is both long and poorly maintained. Many planks are missing, and strong winds shake the bridge as you cross it.  As of now, there is only one suspension bridge connecting the Hussaini Village with Zarabad (located across the Hunza River) Despite its dangerous looks, however, the Hussaini is is a relatively safe bridge and has become one of the most sought-after tourist attractions, with hikers testing their nerves as they carefully work their way across.  Ticket price for visiting the place is 200 pakistan rupees There is a small Juice Outlet that serves the fresh cherries juice and it is a must try. Locals from the village have also setup small stalls of dry fruit which are cultivated by them."
95,Fairy Meadows,"Diamer District, Pakistan",A place as enchanting as the journey to reach it is harrowing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fairy-meadows,"Nestled in the Raikhot valley high in the Himalayas, it’s not hard to guess why this lush green mountain pasture at the foot of a majestic snowy peak was named Fairy Meadows. Known as “Joot” among locals, the place was given the name Märchenwiese (literally “Fairy Tale Meadows”) by German mountaineers who were no doubt astounded when they first glimpsed this idyllic landscape. At 3,300 meters (10,826 feet) above sea level, the wide grassy meadow surrounded by dense alpine forest is fed by waters from a glacier formed by the Nanga Parbat, the ninth-highest mountain in the world (and second-highest in Pakistan, after K2) that towers over Fairy Meadows from the south. A magical setting indeed — made all the more wondrous by the dangerous road one must take to get here. There is only one road to Fairy Meadows, and it isn’t your average tricky mountain road; in 2013, the World Health Organization ranked it as the second deadliest road on the planet. The windy narrow gravel mountain road is open to locals only (thanks to the high number of fatalities the way has claimed), who ferry visitors from Raikhot bridge to the village of Tato, one six-person Jeep-load at a time. If you make it through the ride without ending up a smoldering heap at the bottom of the ravine that stands in as the “shoulder” of the road, you still have a three- to four-hour hike from Tato before you can take in the hidden splendor of Fairy Meadows. But once you’re there, you’ll never want to leave! (Because you’ll be terrified to go back the way you came.) Visitors to Fairy Meadows can find accommodation in small on-site cabins or designated camp sites (the Pakistani government declared the location a National Park in 1995). The site serves as a launching point for mountain climbers summiting the northern face of the Nanga Parbat."
96,Badshahi Mosque,"Lahore, Pakistan",A 17th-century mosque that was used for war more than worship.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/badshahi-mosque,"For 313 years, the Badshahi Mosque was the largest in the world. With capacity for 100,000 worshippers on its grounds, it dwarfed the Taj Mahal, a structure that could fit inside the massive courtyard. Although the mosque seems like a tremendous religious structure, its history has almost seen more use as a military base. For the first 70 years after its construction in 1673, the mosque was known simply for its great size, and was visible from almost 10 miles away. The crown jewel of Lahore, the Badshahi Mosque was a symbol of power in the Mughal Empire. Cursed by its size and location, when the region was cast into civil war and overtaken by Sikhs, the mosque began a new history of exploitation for military purposes. At the turn of the century, Sikhs were in control of Lahore, and began using the mosque as a stable for horses and other military units. 50 years later during the Sikh Civil War, guns were mounted on the 170 foot high minarets to bombard a group that had taken refuge in the nearby Lahore Fort. Throughout British rule, the mosque continued to be used for military storage, and was in a bad state of preservation. After 1947, when Pakistan became an independent Muslim state, the mosque was returned to its original purpose, and extensive repairs were undertaken. Repairs have happened continuously through 2008, and the Badshahi Mosque is now almost restored to its original 17th century condition."

It is mostly famous for the Makran Coastal Highway, which snakes across an inhospitable lunar landscape and passes several bizarre rock formations, most notably a rock resembling the Sphinx of Giza and the so-called Princess of Hope, a rock formation in the shape of a human being on a rocky outcrop. Another important feature of the national park is a mud volcano, the only one in South Asia and at the same time the highest located mud volcano in the world. Its geological features aside, the 1650 square kilometers park is also an important habitat for Ibex, Gazelles, Urials and a large number of bird species."
98,Derawar Fort,"Derawar, Pakistan",Massive fortress bastions in the desert of Cholistan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/derawar-fort-cholistan,"There was once a time when not just anyone could step into the massive stone fortresses whose ruins now dot the countryside mostly as tourist attractions. They weren’t historical landmarks for exploration – they were private property, and sometimes residences, populated by soldiers with a job to do. In the desert of Cholistan, the soldiers are long gone, but one of the most remarkable forts of the medieval world still exists as private property, owned by the royal Abassi family who also keep a necropolis for their family on the property. Derawar Fort is more than 1 kilometer in circumference and 30 meters high, featuring 40 stunning bastions rising out of the vast expanse of empty desert. Its ramparts are wide and smooth, creating an imposing structure unlikely to be breached by advancing forces and, more useful for modern times, an unique appearance more compelling than typical straight-walled castles. It’s very difficult to reach Derawar Fort in its remote location, and typically one needs to hire a special guide to take them on the full-day journey to the site of the fort. That said, pretty much anyone can go look at it, but to go inside, one needs special permisssion from the Amir of Bahawalpur, so visitors need to plan ahead to get the full experience.

Brought to the attention of the outside world by way of tales from Indian and Greco-Roman literature, Taxila presents an explorable walk through the rise of human civilization in Southeast Asia, from Neolithic tombs all the way through to the footsteps of the Buddha himself. Located at the junction of ancient trade routes bestowing prosperity to the area, Taxila is a giant in terms of both size and scope of its archeological holdings. Three distinct masonry techniques divide the site into three separate “cities” hailing from three distinct time periods. In addition to its famed Buddhist stupas, some of which predate the tradition of physical representations of the Buddha, Taxila is considered by many to have the world’s first university, Takṣaśilā. Moreover, the ruins at Sarai Kala were home to Early Harappan remains dating back to as early as 2900 BCE. Though far less well-known than many other historic sites, few places on Earth have such a concentration of our historical record; so it was with little surprise that UNESCO Designated Taxila a World Heritage Site in 1980.  With this influx of preservation and curatorial-mindedness, a museum was created to provide an efficient guide to the three millennia of human civilization underfoot, making the city’s vast wonders accessible to all."
100,Kalasha Valleys,"Chitral District, Pakistan",Unique pagan culture in three extremely remote mountain valleys.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kalasha-valleys-pagan,"In the devoutly Muslim lands of Pakistan, the presence of the pagans in the Kalasha Valleys is quite an anomaly. The three valleys of the Kalash people—Bumburet, Rumbur, and Birir—form a cultural island where ancient traditions and pagan beliefs have managed to sustain themselves throughout time, in a land locally known as Kafiristan, the “Land of the Non-Believers”. The origins of the Kalash people remain mysterious, but it’s generally believed that the Kalash are descendants of Alexander the Great’s army, which seized the region in the third century BC; however, genetic research could not pinpoint their beginnings. The culture of the Kalash people is highly complex, comprised of a belief-system with a multitude of gods and is characterized by rigorous rules regarding taboos, religious ceremonies and animal sacrifices. One of the most unique features of the Kalash people is their relationship with periods. Women retreat into a wooden hut called a Bashali and they can not be touched by others during this time. Since the three valleys are extremely remote, they have more or less successfully resisted Islamization, unlike the Kalash in neighboring Afghanistan, who were forced to convert to Islam in 1893. Pakistan’s government often uses the colorfully dressed Kalash people to demonstrate the diversity of the country. However, today the Kalash people face enormous pressure from surrounding Islamic communities who are pushing toward Islamization of the valleys, one of the valleys already having a Muslim majority. That, coupled with the fact that the valleys are in a region where the Pakistani government has de-facto no control, makes the future of the ancient culture of the Kalashas unknown."
101,Shangri-La Lake,Pakistan,The place that allegedly inspired James Hilton's depiction of Shangri-La.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shangri-la-lake,"Shangri-La is a fictional place described by author James Hilton in the 1933 novel “Lost Horizon.” It is described as a harmonious, peaceful, and isolated place, which was inspired by the mythical Buddhist kingdom of Shambhala. Given the description of Shangri-La (a Tibetan word for “Heaven on Earth,”) one might not immediately think of troubled Pakistan as the proposed location of earthly paradise. It is undisputed that Hilton visited the Northern valleys of Pakistan a couple of years before publishing his book. Nevertheless, the exact location remains unknown, and one can only speculate which place in the Greater Himalayan Region was the main inspiration for his depiction. In an attempt to fuel tourism to Pakistan, the Skardu Valley was promoted as the “true” locale that served as the inspirational source for Hilton. In 1983, the Shangri-La Resort (no relation to the chain of luxury hotels of the same name) was opened at the Lower Kachura Lake, which was then given the moniker Shangri-La Lake. As a result of the continued volatile political situation in Pakistan, the anticipated influx of tourists never came. Thus, today, the resort sits rather forlorn in the undoubtedly beautiful valley. The resort comprises of two buildings of mock-Chinese architecture, as well as an airplane, which once served as a restaurant (but is only sporadically open today). The airplane is a reference to Hilton’s depiction of a plane that crash-landed at Shangri-La – makes the unusual sight of Far East Asian architecture in Pakistan even stranger. Unsurprisingly, the Skardu Valley is not the only place in the greater region which claims to be the “real” Shangri-La. Most of these places are located in the People’s Republic of China. In 2001, Zhongdian County in Yunnan, was even officially renamed Shangri-La County. Additionally, historians regularly claim that certain places in Nepal, Bhutan and India might have been the true inspirational source for Hilton.

In reality, Mumtaz Begum is neither a fox nor a woman, but is actually played by the performer Murad Ali, a man who inherited the role from his father who had previously portrayed the supernatural attraction. Each day Ali cakes his face with a thick layer of makeup and bright red lipstick and crawls into the box beneath Mumtaz’s cage, popping his head through a hole in the top to make it look as though his head is attached to a lounging fox carcass. A shawl is placed around Ali’s head to hide the connection and then the visitors begin filtering in. The creature that Ali plays is known as a kitsune, which is said to be able to see the future. Children and adults alike come to the zoo to ask Mumtaz Begum about everything from exam results to visa approvals. Ali gamely provides advise and peppers the interaction with references to his mysterious origin and his diet of juice and cakes. Visitors coming to see Mumtaz Begum often leave small donations and cake and juice like supplicants to a charlatan prophet. However in true huckster fashion, anyone wishing to speak with the kitsune will need to pony up for a special ticket into the Mumtaz Mahal itself."

The Hinatuan Enchanted River in Mindanao, Philippines, is a flawless saltwater river that flows into the Pacific Ocean. It is around 80-feet deep, and just barely long enough to be considered a river, yet the flow attracts visitors from around the world who want to experience the beautiful waters that locals have long thought to be miraculous. Its moniker “Enchanted River” came from a poem by Modesto Farolan. In fact, no one is sure exactly where the saltwater emanates from, although the prevailing theory involves an underground cave system that spits the river out, free of any dirt or silt which would usually cloud such a stream. Whatever the explanation, the clean waters are a natural wonder unlike any other. Local legends tell all sorts of stories about the river. One of which states that fairies added some mesmerizing colors of sapphire and jade to the river. Another legend states that the river is home to a mysterious fish that is impossible to catch. In 2017, the local government prohibited swimming in the main pool for preservation and maintenance. At the same time, they designated a swimming area some  33 feet (10 meters) away from the pool. Travelers should keep in mind that the infrastructure by the river is close to zero, thus, there are no facilities to buy medicine or food.  From the Butuan City Domestic Airport, you can take a van that goes straight to the town of Hinatuan. They can let you off near a signboard that Hinatuan Enchanted River where you can ride a motorcycle that passes through a dirt road and then a forested area leading to the river.You may also come in from Davao City and take a van or a bus to the same signboard to Hinatuan."

The bamboo tables and cook stations at the watery eatery sit merely feet from the rush of a small waterfall, allowing guests to lean under the rushing waters after finishing their barefoot meal. Diners can tuck into a kamayan-style buffet of fish, rice, barbecued chicken and bananas (the latter is locally known as “banana cue”), fresh fruit, and more, all spread across banana leaves. The small falls, known as Labasin Falls, is not actually a natural falls, but instead is the runoff from the Labasin Dam, the Philippines’ first hydroelectric plant. But despite being an artificial falls that runs beneath the tables at the Waterfalls Restaurant, the uniqueness of the experience is very real."
105,Asik-Asik Falls,"Alamada, Philippines",This wondrous waterfall rushing down a green-covered mountain wasn't discovered until 2010.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/asikasik-falls,"Streams of pristine water rushing down a mountain cliff covered wholly in green makes for a stunning image, and the judges of a national photography contest held in 2012 in the Philippines clearly thought so too. They awarded a photo of the Asik-Asik waterfalls in the mountainous Alamada region, and in doing so, announced the existence of this natural wonder to the world. The picture went viral on social media, and Filipinos were stunned by this discovery. The beautiful falls had been unknown to the public for a remarkably long time; the residents of the nearby village of Sitio Dulao had only come across the site two years earlier, after a series of floods and forest fires destroyed a significant chunk of the forest that was hiding it. The newfound oasis was christened Asik-Asik, meaning “sprinkle-sprinkle” in the local Hiligaynon language, after the sprinkle of falling water on nearby rocks. Lush vegetation covers the entirety of the ravine, and adds mystery as to where the water is coming from. The most likely sources are thought to be springs deep within the mountain or an underground river. Getting to the falls is not as daunting as it used to be, after the government, sensing a wonderful tourism opportunity, developed the roads and site around it. But there are still descending and ascending treks on stairs that wind around the mountain side. A tiny portion of the falls can be seen from the top, but as you descend, the full majesty of water gushing from the green mountainside slowly reveals itself in all its glory."
106,Hanging Coffins of Sagada,"Sagada, Philippines",Hundreds of wooden coffins dangle from cliffs and caves in the Philippines.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hanging-coffins-of-sagada,"The people of Sagada follow a unique burial ritual. The elderly carve their own coffins out of hollowed logs. If they are too weak or ill, their families prepare their coffins instead. The dead are placed inside their coffins (sometimes breaking their bones in the process of fitting them in), and the coffins are brought to a cave for burial. Instead of being placed into the ground, the coffins are hung either inside the caves or on the face of the cliffs, near the hanging coffins of their ancestors. The Sagada people have been practicing such burials for over 2,000 years, and some of the coffins are well over a century old. Eventually the coffins deteriorate and fall from their precarious positions. The reason the coffins were hung was due to the belief that the higher the dead were placed, the greater chance of their spirits reaching a higher nature in the afterlife. Many of the locations of the coffins are difficult to reach (and obviously should be left alone out of respect), but can be appreciated from afar. Do not touch or walk under the coffins. Bring binoculars or a telephoto camera to view these remarkable coffins from a respectful distance. From Manila, by bus or private car, travel north to Mountain Province. For commuters: you can find buses in Cubao headed directly to Sagada. The alternative is to hop on a bus headed to either Banaue or Baguio and then transfer to respective public rides bound to Sagada. During summer, it will take you about 12-13 hours to reach Sagada. During the rainy season, not only is travel time longer, but the roads also become very dangerous, and sometimes closed due to landslides."
107,Vulcan Point,Philippines,"An island in the middle of a lake, in the middle of a volcano, in the middle of a bigger lake, in the middle of a bigger island, in an archipelago, in the Pacific Ocean.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vulcan-point,"The paradisiacal beauty of Lake Taal, on an island in the archipelago known as the Philippines, belies the mammoth terror at its center: a highly active volcano that has taken thousands of lives and has been roiling since 1991 after a dormant period following its 1977 eruption. With 33 recorded eruptions, the Taal Volcano is the second most active volcano in the Philippines and a part of the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire,” a large swath of the Pacific known for its earthquakes and active volcanoes. Despite the active seismic activity, this place is rather popular with tourists. Once at the Taal Lake shore, travelers take a boat to reach the volcano island, where they either hike up the hill or ride a horse. But the Taal Volcano is more than that. The region has some strange geological features that attract visitors from around the world. The way the features are arranged is something like nesting dolls. On the Filipino island of Luzon is Lake Taal. Within that lake is a volcano, Taal Volcano. At the top of the volcano, a thousand feet above sea level, is a basin, known as a caldera, carved out of the mountain hundreds of thousands of years ago. The caldera itself is filled with water, creating a crater lake, the largest crater lake in the world. At the center of the crater lake is a tiny island, Vulcan Point, which is one of Taal Volcano’s cones. The title of “the largest third-order island” is a short form of the logic that it’s an island within a lake, within another island, within a lake, on an island, within an archipelago, within the Pacific. On January 12, 2020, the Taal Volcano erupted, resulting in the deaths of 39 people. The eruption has caused the crater lake to dry up and disappear. Regular tours might not be operating in the near future as the area recovers.  Taal Lake is located less than 100 km south of Manila."
108,Barracuda Lake,"Coron, Philippines",This curious fresh and salt water lake holds a secret that draws in deep divers from around the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/barracuda-lake,"Barracuda Lake, situated on the north shore of Coron Island in the Philippines, offers one of the most unique diving experiences in the world. Occasionally referred to as Luluyuan Lake by locals, its crystal blue waters hidden between majestic rocky formations aren’t big on actual barracudas and other wildlife. Instead, divers can experience a thermocline and halocline unlike anywhere else. Starting out on the surface of the lake, divers, swimmers, and scuba enthusiasts can expect temperatures around 82 degrees Fahrenheit. But as you descend into the depths of the lake, around 45 to 50 feet down, the temperature drastically changes to just over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (to put that in perspective, most people keep their hot tubs at 104 degrees, so it’s best to forego a wetsuit here). This strange increase in temperature is due to the fact that the lake contains both salt and freshwater. Divers can even see the thin, distinct boundary that separates the two bodies of water. The lake is also characterized by an impressive display of limestone formations that rise up on all sides and extend beneath the surface. Divers have described a sense of “weightlessness” while exploring the hot/cool depths, and the sensorial experience (which is largely devoid of flora and fauna) has also been likened to what it must feel like to walk on the moon. But the lake holds yet another surprise: just when the salt watery heat becomes a tad unbearable, the temperature changes back to cool again near the bottom. Another unique feature of the lake is the sand at the very bottom, which has been described as “jelly-like,” “silky,” “airy,” and “silty.” It’s apparently good for play, too. And although the barracudas aren’t really around anymore, if you’re lucky, you may still catch a glimpse of one.  This lake is best experienced via scuba diving to get the full experience of the thermocline."
109,Fantasy World,"Lemery, Philippines","The abandoned medieval theme park was meant to be the ""Disneyland of the Philippines.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fantasy-world,"A castle sits atop a hill in the Philippines, its colorful walls adding an unexpected pop of color to the surrounding greenery. The stalwart structure, which looks like an image straight from a fairytale, seems oddly out of place. There were grand plans for the castle and its surrounding theme park to become the “Disneyland of the Philippines.” Called Fantasy World, it was meant to rival the beloved international amusement parks. But for the people behind Fantasy World, opening the park was a dream that never came true. The businessman who backed the project ran into financial issues before construction was complete, forcing him to abandon his plan. Now, the castle’s once-bright exterior is fading. Paint peels from the walls of its unfinished rooms. The rides lay dormant, never able to grumble to life beneath hordes of delighted children. Though the park couldn’t open as planned, you can still enter and explore the Disneyland that could have been. You can walk across the rope bridge that leads to the park’s tree house, which offers beautiful views of the local scenery. You can even climb the castle’s towers and feel like a real-life Rapunzel surveying the empty kingdom. Though it never opened as planned, tourists can still enter (for a fee) to wander around and take pictures."
110,Philippine Tarsier and Wildlife Sanctuary,"Corella, Philippines",A patch of Philippines forest devoted to saving the lives of an emotionally sensitive species of googly-eyed primates.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/philippine-tarsier-sanctuary,"On the Philippine island of Bohol, there is a sanctuary populated not just by skinny trees but also by protected tarsiers, an endangered species of strange-looking primates that cling to the thin branches with their long, alien fingers. The Tarsier Sanctuary is a large forest dedicated to the protection of tarsiers, small nocturnal primates with big, round eyes that feed primarily on insects. They usually cling to low branches or the trunks of slim trees. Prior to the development of the sanctuaries, many tarsiers were kept as pets by private individuals in environments not conducive to their lifestyle and survival. Tarsiers are delicate, emotionally sensitive creatures that get stressed easily (and they have been known to commit suicide via banging their heads against tree trunks), so visitors have to lower their voices and keep the noise level to a minimum. Visitors are allowed to take pictures (without the flash), but touching the tarsiers is an absolute taboo. The sanctuary is officially run by the Philippine Tarsier Foundation, an organization devoted to making sure that the dwindling and delicate population survives and thrives. The park also has a store where tourists can buy t-shirts, key chains, and hats to promote the protection and preservation of the tarsiers and their habitats. Unfortunately the situation in the Philippines is obscure when it comes to organizations claiming to be tarsiers’ conservation units. There is at least another one with the mention “conservation area” in the name but this is one is a mini-zoo, built only for touristic purposes.  It's easy to find since it's well known. In the town of Corella, travel to Barangay Canapnapan to Tarsier Sanctuary Road, where you will find the sanctuary."
111,Chocolate Hills,"Sierra Bullones, Philippines",Bohol's mysterious brown hills.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chocolate-hills,"Were you to fly over Bohol Island in the Philippines during the dry season, you might notice what looks like thousands of chocolate kisses protruding from the terrain. These mysterious conical mounds are known as the Chocolate Hills. There are approximately 1,268 individual hills, their heights ranging from 100 to 160 feet, though the highest is almost 400 feet high. The hills, which are almost all symmetrical, consist of grass-covered limestone and turn brown during the dry season. Despite the abundance of hills, it is unclear how they were formed. There are multiple geological explanations ranging from oceanic volcano activity to limestone weathering. A recent theory is that an ancient volcano self-destructed and chunks of it were dispersed over the region. Numerous legends and tales also exist to explain the Chocolate Hills. One is about a giant buffalo who came and wreaked havoc in the region, eating and destroying all the crops. As an act of vengeance, locals left out spoiled crops. When the buffalo ate them it got sick and left mounds of feces in its wake, bringing new meaning to the name “Chocolate Hills.”"
112,The Ruins in Talisay,"Talisay City, Philippines",A once great mansion stands in stately ruin.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-ruins-in-talisay-talisay-city-philippines,"According to the story, in the early 20th century sugar baron Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson built his ten bedroom Italianate mansion in memory of his wife, who had died during the pregnancy of his 11th child. Located on a sugar plantation in the Negros Occidental province of the Philippines, WWII Filipino guerrillas employed by the US Armed forces intentionally set the building on fire in order to prevent invading Japanese forces from being able to use the building as a headquarters. The intention was to burn it to the ground. Despite smoldering for several days, the walls and foundation of Don Lacson’s once stately home remained sound. After sitting idle for decades, the grounds at Talisay have been restored and reopened to the public, though the mansion is still without windows, a roof, interior walls, and much of the floor that once divided the first and second stories. Today the Ruins is a picturesque tourist destination with a restaurant nearby. It  is a popular venue for weddings and other social events."
113,Abandoned Puerto Azul,"Ternate, Philippines",The once-grand remains of this resort are slowly turning into the strange ruins of the future.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-puerto-azul,"In its heyday, the Puerto Azul Golf and Country Club in Ternate, Philippines, was a lush pleasure destination where people from around the world came to enjoy its tropical amenities, but today large portions of the resort have fallen into disrepair, closed off and abandoned to the jungle to become the lost ruins of tomorrow. During the 1980s, when the resort was new, it was called “The Golf Capital of the World,” and “Asia’s Paradise Resort”, but today it looks more like a nightmare resort. When it was at full working capacity, the massive facility had more than 300 hundred rooms spread out in little clusters that essentially formed their own village areas. The jewel of Puerto Azul, however, was the challenging and picturesque golf course, which had been designed by a legend in the sport, Gary Player. For a time it was surrounded by an air of exclusivity and opulence that was nearly unrivaled. Unfortunately, the changing tastes and trends of the rich and vacationing began to change as other resorts and golfing options opened up in the area, drawing away the customer base and making Puerto Azul seem more and more dated. The resort also ran into legal troubles, and eventually portions of the organization had to be shuttered. Although both the property’s owners and local government continually talked about revitalizing the sprawling property, nothing ever materialized. While everyone dithered, nature and time took their toll on the abandoned portions of the resort. Today Puerto Azul continues to operate, but large portions of it are abandoned and off limits to visitors. Rumors of an effort to bring the resort back to life still surface, but the many of the buildings have been irrevocably retaken by the tropical surrounds. Parts of the old resort now look like a modern version of some crumbling Indonesian temple; given enough time and neglect, they may come to mirror those stunningly overgrown ruins even more closely.  From Manila, take the Coastal Road Highway then take the Cavitex Road. Drive straight for a while going past Kawit and Naic. Make sure you stick to the parts of the resort that are sanctioned to visit, and do not trespass on the off-limits portions of the abandoned resort."
114,Sunken Cemetery,"Catarman, Philippines",A cemetery and the town it served sinks beneath the sea during the volcanic birth of Mt. Vulcan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sunken-cemetery,"There are no flowers or gravestones to mark the resting places of the lost citizens of Camiguin – only a giant cross rising up out of the water to mark where this place of rest once was. In the 1870s, a volcano near this place erupted and caused the cemetery along with the capital city surrounding it to sink below sea level. In order to commemorate this place of loss, a looming cross was built in remembrance. Visitors all over the Philippines and the world come to admire this man-made marvel filled with legend and enchantment. Some say a feeling of loneliness will hit you once you see this structure standing all alone in the middle of the sea. A place of reverence and reflection, the site is accessible by boat and visitors can stand on its small base while it remains above water. Many take the small boat ride in order to take photos and soak in the view of Mt. Vulcan, the volcano that sacrificed the people of Camiguin to the sea when it came into being."
115,Corregidor Island,"Cavite City, Philippines",The ruins on a deserted tropical island in the Philippines bear the scars of WWII.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/corregidor-island,"Located at the entrance to Manila Bay, “Isla ng Corregidor” was identified by the Spaniards as a strategic defense location when they arrived in the 16th century. They named it “Island of the Corrector,” since this was the place where all ships entering Manila would stop for inspection. Since then the fortress island has been the site of many battles, from the Spanish-American War to the period of American colonialism. The oldest landmark on the island is the lighthouse dated 1853, but much of this lush tropical island is dominated by ruins that reflect the intense fighting that took place in World War II. In addition to defense and battery buildings, there are shops, a movie theater, and a swimming pool, all from the soldiers stationed here many years ago. During the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in 1941, Corregidor was the temporary headquarters of the Philippine Government. American and Philippine troops fought desperately to defend the island using tunnels dug into the rock as storage for ammunition and hospitals, but without reinforcements the troops were beaten badly. Corregidor was surrendered to the Japanese by spring of 1942. In 1945 the tide of war turned against the Japanese. Enduring months of aerial and naval bombardment in the tunnels on the island, they surrendered to American and Philippine forces in February that year. Even on a bright, sunny day the place is heavy with memories of what happened here. The buildings and fortifications have been left untouched, which would give the impression that the fighting ended just yesterday if it weren’t for the greenery that has grown over in the decades since their abandonment. Tour guides on the island report they are still finding detritus from the battles of WWII. They occasionally come across objects in the jungle undergrowth dating back to even earlier, when Philippines and American families were stationed on the island at the turn of the 20th century. The expansive tunnels below ground are no doubt the eeriest part of the island. These dark corridors are allegedly haunted by Japanese soldiers who took their own lives before defeat, but whether or not you believe that legend, the tunnels are disturbing for the sheer amount of violence that occurred there. The island is now a designated national monument and war memorial. The ruins have been maintained in memory of the American, Philippine, and Japanese soldiers who fought and died here. As it is a designated national monument access to Corregidor is by guided tour only. Tours can be arranged through Sun Cruises which depart from the pier located next to harbor square adjacent to Manila Yacht club. Departures for Corregidor island are twice daily during the week and three times on weekends. The guides are knowledgeable and very friendly, many are ex–servicemen. There is also a small hotel on the island so it is also possible to stay overnight and take advantage of the after dark tours of the island."
116,Tinago Falls,"Iligan City, Philippines",Hidden deep within a Filipino jungle is an incredible waterfall that plunges into a dazzling blue-green pool.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tinago-falls,"Away from the more than 300,000 inhabitants of nearby Iligan City, Tinago Falls provides a serene getaway deep within the jungles of Mindanao. Tucked within a forest-fringed ravine, this mighty waterfall’s name fittingly means “one that is hidden.” Approximately 240 feet high, its colossal rock structures are dotted by thick masses of trees and natural foliage. Despite this towering scene, what lies at the bottom of the falls leaves visitors in even greater awe. Tinago’s basin features a stunning blue-green pool of water. The colorful sheen of the water is more than enough to inspire legends of supernatural guardians that protect this aquamarine refuge. In spite of its mystic undertones, Tinago has been developed by locals to carry adventurers toward the falls. By way of a small ferry ride on one of two makeshift bamboo rafts, you can experience one of the area’s main attractions: when directly underneath the plunging falls, you can feel the therapeutic beating of the water on your skin. More than a hundred feet deep, the basin is not only a site for those who want a peaceful sanctuary, but also those who crave adventure. Thrill-seekers and adrenaline junkies are often found climbing and jumping off of the high rock walls surrounding the basin.  Tinago is under the care of the Philippine Tourism Authority. As a result, a small fee of about 50₱ (around $1) is required. Be prepared to climb up and down the ravine's more than 500 individual stairs. Bring some water to drink, you'll need it."
117,Puerto Princesa Subterranean River,"Puerto Princesa, Philippines",Five miles of underground river link lake to ocean.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/puerto-princesa-subterranean-river,"In 1898, the American Zoologist Dean C. Worcester described mysteries and wonders of the Philippine Islands from his travels, including the tantalizing reference, “If accounts are to be believed, of a lake opening to the sea by a subterranean river.” This extraordinary river does indeed exist, snaking over five miles underground through limestone caves, linking lake to ocean in the Palawan province of the Philippines. One of the world’s longest underground waterways, the Cabayugan River passes though 15 miles of caves, studded with stalactites and stalagmites, the water rising and falling with the tides of the South China Sea at its end. The caves have been a National Park since 1971, made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999, and was named one of the “New Seven Wonders of Nature” in 2012.  The easiest for groups of people (e.g., families, friends) is to book the visit to the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River through a travel agency, whether in town or in Manila. However, it is also possible to do it yourself. There are public transport going to Sabang and back (though often it's full when going back to Puerto Princesa. Just make sure to pay your entry fee to the Subterranean River in Puerto Princesa. Go early as they have a daily limit."
118,Timbac Mummies of the Philippines,"Kabayan, Philippines",Smoked mummies housed in mountainside caves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/timbac-mummies-of-the-philippines,"Known by a variety of names such as the Kabayan Mummies, Ibaloi Mummies or Benguet Mummies, the Fire Mummies of the Philippines remain an elusive bunch. With their exact locations kept unpublicized by the government due to a a series of thefts in the 1900s, the mummies can be found only after a five hour car ride up the mountains to the villages of Kabayan, then another five hour hike up a dizzying escalation of stone steps. There the mummies stay in Timbac caves, still curled in their original coffins. Scientists believe these mummies were first created sometime by the Ibaloi tribe between 1200 and 1500 CE. Mummification began shortly before a person died, where they would ingest a very salty drink. After death, the body was washed and set over a fire in a seated position, thus drying the fluids. Tobacco smoke was blown into the mouth to dry the inside of the body and internal organs. Finally, herbs were rubbed on the body. It’s estimated that the entire process could take weeks, sometimes months, to finish. They were then buried in the caves. The practice died out in the 1500s when Spain colonized the Philippines. Today, the mummies are left in their natural caves with relatively little security and have been designated as one of the 100 most endangered sites in the world. Officials know of between 50 and 80 other mummies, but they will not give their locations for fear of vandalism. Locals still pay respects to these exposed mummies with offerings such as gin and chicken dishes, ensuring the dead are well fed and are having a good time in the afterlife. A small museum in Kabayan also displays a few mummies."
119,Gardens by the Bay,Singapore,Singapore's landscaping project is home to 18 incredible Supertrees.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gardens-by-the-bay,"Along Singapore’s Marina Bay, a landscaping project known as Gardens by the Bay hopes to beautify the marina and help transform the dense city-state into a “city in the garden.” But with futuristic design features that border on otherworldly, this garden is unlike any you’ve seen before. Due to their sheer height and fantastical appearance, Gardens by the Bay’s defining feature is almost certainly its collection of 18 “Supertrees.” With heights ranging from 80 to 160 feet and light displays that come alive at night, the Supertrees complement the nearby high-rises and add distinctive flair to the Singapore skyline. As you may have guessed, these trees are not trees in the traditional sense, but rather a series of man-made frames which house both greens and green technology. Roughly 200 species of orchids, ferns, and other tropical climbers scale the Supertrees’ trunks, forming a lush, colorful skin. In some regards the Supertrees imitate the functions of regular trees: absorbing and redistributing heat, collecting and filtering rainwater, and providing shade with their expansive canopies. Eleven of the trees are outfitted with either solar panels, which power the Supertree Grove’s lighting displays, or ventilation systems used to capture exhaust from the park’s greenhouses. Visitors can get an up-close look at these mechanical marvels from a 72-foot-high walkway known as the OCBC Skyway. The Supertrees, though probably the park’s most visually commanding features, are by no means the only impressive attraction at Gardens by the Bay; the garden complex is also home to two enormous greenhouses, as well as several outdoor gardens and lakes. The Flower Dome supports thousands of varieties of cool-dry climate plants and flowers, while the nearby Cloud Forest fosters plants that prefer wet conditions found on mountains and tropical highlands. Both of these greenhouses use sustainable technologies to minimize the their environmental impact. In addition to incorporating elements of the natural world into Singapore’s city life, Singapore’s government hopes the project will attract ecotourists from around the world.  While there is an entrance fee for the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, the outdoor gardens including the Supertree Grove are free. Don’t miss the spectacular light and sound show that takes place at the Supertree Grove at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. every night. The gardens are open 5:00 a.m.-2:00 a.m. daily, but are not illuminated in the early morning. The Supertree lights are turned off at midnight."
120,Singapore's Rooftop Pool,Singapore,The largest pool at its elevation sits on top of one of the most expensive resorts in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/singapore-rooftop-pool,"The Singapore skyline boasts the largest swimming pool of any other skyline in the world. The massive pool sits on the 57th floor, above the three 55-story high hotel towers of the Marina Bay Sands Resort, an integrated resort property whose construction project was the most expensive of its kind. The design, conceptualized by the resort’s architect Moshe Safdie, was inspired by a deck of playing cards, appropriate, as one of the hotel’s main attractions is its large casino. The pool’s vanishing edge gives the appearance of an abrupt cut-off at 650 feet in the air; however, just below the top edge is another trough-like basin which catches the water and returns it to the main pool. Measuring 478 feet long, almost three Olympic swimming pools in length, the SkyPark pool is the world’s largest infinity-edge pool at that height. There is also a restaurant, bar, spa, and botanical garden with 250 species of trees and 650 plants, and an observation deck which costs 23 SGD (or around 18 USD) to enjoy. Please note you cannot swim or relax at the poolside unless you are a hotel guest. Marina Bay Sands is linked directly to Bayfront Station on the Circle Line and Downtown Line of Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) train system. MRT services to/from Bayfront Station operate daily from (approximately) 6:00am to midnight."
121,Haw Par Villa,Singapore,A Buddhist theme park brings you a Buddhist version of Hell.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/haw-par-villa,"Mentioning Haw Par Villa to Chinese Singaporeans may raise an eyebrow or two, and will likely lead to a conversation about how they were forced to go there as children in order to learn about good morals, the consequences of their actions, and to see the horrors they may face in the afterlife, should they stray. Casually referred to as a “Buddhist amusement park”, Haw Par Villa is actually a very graphic and educational journey through the hodgepodge of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism that constitute the traditional fabric of Chinese life, legend, spirituality and morality – along with a smattering of references to Singaporean history and their relationship to the world around them – spelled out in greater than life-size plaster dioramas. The villa was created in 1937 as “Tiger Balm Gardens” by Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, the makers of the medicinal ointment known as Tiger Balm, as a way to give back to the community and to pass on the beliefs and values of Chinese culture to the uninitiated. After many years of additions – many were dubious and short lived – and changes (some statues were moved to the Chinese Garden in western Singapore), the sprawling grounds still feature hundreds of huge dioramas (some of which are large enough to walk into), and over a thousand wonderfully rendered statues. As you walk through the park you will come across a beautiful koi and turtle pond that is a great spot to take a break, feed the fish and relax amongst the bridges, pagodas and, incongruously, the Statue of Liberty. You can easily spend an entire afternoon losing yourself in this plaster maze of mythology posing with the Monkey King and Sumo wrestlers, or the very, very bloody battle between rabbits and rats, but be mindful to save some time for the highlight of your trip: Buddhist Hell. Loosely based on Buddhist notions of Hell, the Ten Courts of Hell Cave uniquely illustrates the cultural synthesis of Buddhist and other mythologies that is ubiquitous in Chinese culture. viewable in all of its surrealistic beauty and spooky lighting. You will be treated to a very graphic, up close and personal account of what you have to look forward to as a result of your transgressions in this life. Not to give any of it away, but who knew being reincarnated was so involved, or so brutal? A walk back to feed the turtles may be in order after this, or maybe a visit to the gift shop. Tiger Balm soothes all aches…  Taxi: A quick ride from downtown, but it's also a straight shot from HarbourFront MRT (NE1), which makes it an easy side trip if you plan on visiting VivoCity or Sentosa. Train: A MRT stop on the Circle Line named Haw Par Villa (CC25) takes you to the front gate. Bus: Take SBS Transit bus 200 from Buona Vista MRT Station (EW21), SBS Transit bus 10, 30, SMRT Bus 188 from HarbourFront Centre, SBS Transit bus 143 from Orchard Road, SBS Transit bus 51 from Chinatown, or SBS Transit bus 175 from Clementi MRT Stn/Temporary Bus Interchange. Tickets: Note that while there is no cost to check out Haw Par Villa, there is an admission fee to see the Ten Courts of Hell, which is part of Hell's Museum. It's 18 SGD for adults and 10 SGD for children (free for those aged 6 and under). If you want to pay using a credit/debit card, you can purchase your tickets in advance via their website."

That may seem like quite an investment to honor a fragment of bone, but the tooth purportedly belongs to one of the most famous religious figures in history—the Buddha. The temple claims that the tooth is a relic recovered in 1980 from a collapsed stupa in Myanmar, but little additional information has been provided. Experts have called into question the authenticity of the tooth, saying that it is most likely “the tooth of a cow or water buffalo, but definitely not a human.” The tooth is located on the fourth story of the temple in the Sacred Light Chamber. It is only available for viewing during certain hours, so be sure to check the website before you go. Photography is strictly forbidden inside the relic chamber. Even if you miss the tooth, the temple itself is very impressive, featuring multiple floors of buddha statues, nagas (the popular Southeast Asian dragon-snakes that guard sacred relics), and impressive ceremonial venues in which to pray and meditate. There are a handful of other temples that claim to have tooth relics, including the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, Sri Lanka."

For Chan Hon Meng’s soya sauce chicken rice, you’ll need $3. Do expect to stand in line for an hour or two, though. The Malaysian-born chef dropped out of school at 15 to help his parents on their pig, duck, and vegetable farm. He decided he wanted to work in the kitchen in his 20s, and began training in Hong Kong. The techniques and recipes he learned there became the cornerstone of the food-court stall he opened with his wife, Irene, in Singapore in 2009. Every day, he makes his secret Cantonese-style, soya sauce–based marinade from scratch (without divulging all of its ingredients, he concedes to adding Chinese angelica roots, cloves, coriander, and star anise). He marinates 180 chickens overnight before braising and hanging them in his stall-front before service opens. The accompanying rice is fried in chicken fat and boiled in chicken stock. While he sells char siew noodles, pork rib, and hor fun noodles, the chicken is his stall’s major draw. When Michelin representatives phoned Meng in 2016, inviting him to the Michelin Guide Singapore Gala Dinner, he thought they were kidding. The representative insisted that the awards were selected based on food rather than venue. With that, Meng’s stall became the home of the world’s most affordable Michelin-starred meal. In the year after earning his star, he opened a full restaurant in the mall next to the food court, as well as several others, as far away as Thailand and Taiwan, with plans slated for Melbourne, as well. While he has aspirations to sell his chicken around the world, he refuses to compromise on its accessibility and flavor, hoping each plate of chicken tastes exactly as it does in the original humble food court stall that won him culinary acclaim."
124,Henderson Waves,Singapore,The highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore looks like a series of undulating waves rising between two public parks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/henderson-waves,"The city-state of Singapore is the greenest city in Asia according to the Green City Index. The green cover of the so-called Garden City is almost at 50 percent, and the lush environments are supported by a focus on renewable energy and future sustainability. Part of this interconnected system is the Southern Ridges, a 6.2-mile (10-kilometer) trail in the south of the city. And this is where you’ll find the Henderson Waves, the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. The idea for the Southern Ridges was conceived in 2002. Its aim was to connect a series of parks located along the southern ridge of Singapore, with one trail running between the Mount Faber, Telok Blangah Hill, and Kent Ridge parks and the Labrador Nature Reserve. To achieve this, local authorities commissioned a number of architecturally striking pedestrian bridges and walkways to connect the different green spaces, at a cost of S$25.5 million (US $18.5 million). The Henderson Waves, completed in 2008, is the most impressive of all the bridges along the trail. It connects Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Hill Park, stretching for 899 feet (274 meters) and reaching a height of 118 feet (36 meters) above Henderson Road. The bridge’s most notable feature is its organic wave-like design. The walkway itself is formed by slats of yellow Balau wood, sourced from certified sustainable timber farms in East Malaysia, and around this flow the “waves.” The waves are formed by seven undulating curved steel ribs that at various stages rise over or beneath the walkway. In some sections, the wave flows high over the bridge forming alcoves that provide sheltered seating areas for passing pedestrians. The bridge was designed to integrate with the green areas around it. At the same time, it was made with multifunctionality in mind. Not only does it connect two green spaces, it also provides a recreational experience in its own right. It’s a popular destination for joggers and walkers, as well as couples and families who come to sit in the shaded alcoves. People come to enjoy the panoramic views of the city, harbor, and Southern Islands, while bird watchers walk the bridge to spot the various birds that can be seen in the surrounding canopy. And at night a different experience awaits. Every day between 7 p.m. and 2 a.m. the bridge is illuminated with LED lights, creating a wave of light that flows through the Singapore night.  Henderson Waves is located in the south of Singapore. It crosses over Henderson Road and connects Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Hill Park. You can get there by taking the bus (number 145) to the stop on Henderson Road right beneath the bridge. From here you’ll find a staircase going up to the bridge. Alternatively, you can get the bridge from Mount Faber. From the cable car station on Faber Peak, it’s a 15 to 20 minute walk to Henderson Waves."
125,Changi Airport Slides,Singapore,The busy transport hub is home to the tallest airport slide in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/changi-airport-slides,"“Fun” is a rarely used adjective when it comes to air travel, but Changi Airport has long endeavored to change that. With above-and-beyond amenities such as a rooftop swimming pool and an indoor jungle space known as the Jewel, it’s no surprise that the transport hub was voted the best of its kind in Skytrax’s 2019 World Airport Awards—a title that Changi has held on to for seven consecutive years. Among Changi Airport’s most functional wonders are two giant slides that send travelers to their gates with as much speed as amusement. Unveiled in Terminal 3 in 2010, the original slide towers over 39 feet high across four stories as the tallest slide in Singapore and a record-holder among airports. With dims yet to be confirmed, the newer of the two slides is located in Terminal 4, and empties out near a five-story netted play area known as the “Red Chandelier.” But it’s not all fun and games—terms and conditions apply. In order to access either slide, travelers have to have spent a minimum of $10 at a shop or restaurant in Changi Airport that day, and passengers can redeem up to 10 joyrides within 24 hours. For those who skew toward the traditional, stairs and escalators are still a classic means of reaching each gate.  The slides are open to travelers between 12 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. The $10 that passengers are required to have spent in the airport excludes medical clinics, Crowne Plaza Hotel fees, currency exchange fees, and a Jewel cash card. In order to gain access to the Changi Airport slides, participants must be between four and six and a half feet tall."
126,The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum,Singapore,Terrapins of all colors and shapes are quick to bring fascination (and possibly long life) at this museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-live-turtle-and-tortoise-museum-singapore,"Located inside Lorong Chencharu, ORTO,  the Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum in Singapore hosts more than 800 turtles and tortoises across more than 50 different species. The menagerie is surprisingly colorful and diverse with varieties such as the long-necked snake-headed turtles, the otherworldy mata-mata, and the regal golden soft-shell turtle. The hard-shelled reptiles are spread out in pools, ponds, and tanks where visitors can view the living specimens. There are vegetables for purchase to feed the creatures, but anyone wishing to get up close and personal with the turtles is advised that they may mistake your fingers for carrots. In addition to the zoo collection, the museum has thousands of terrapin-shaped ceramics, dishes, furniture pieces, and knick-knacks of all sorts. In Japanese tradition, turtles represent long life and good fortune, so if you are lucky, a visit to The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum might not just be educational, but also life-extending.   Five to 10 minute walk from Khatib MRT. Closed on Tuesdays. Open 10 am to 6 pm daily."
127,Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve,Singapore,This rare wildlife haven in Singapore feels like you're in the tropical rainforest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sungei-buloh-wetland-reserve,"Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is a fresh spark of natural greenery and rich biodiversity, something which is largely uncommon in Singapore. The unique rustic charm is especially beautiful around the mangrove areas. In many ways, it almost feels like you’re entering the tropical rainforest of Malaysia or Indonesia. But in fact you are here in the far northwestern area of Singapore in a unique wildlife haven. Sungei Buloh, Singapore’s first ASEAN Heritage Park, has its trails pass through coastal areas, forest trails, mid-canopy walks and migratory bird trails. The entire route covers the distance of 3,700 meters. The reserve is an important stopover point for over 150 species of exotic migratory birds from as far as Alaska, Siberia, Northern China and Australia, making this an important ecological site forming the East Asian Australasian Shorebird Site Network. Other than migratory birds, many distinctive fauna can be found along the wetland. One of the most frequent animal sightings is the infamous Malayan water monitor lizard, which is huge enough that some people confuse them with the Komodo dragon. For expert guidance, learn and explore with experienced guides by joining the free guided walks that are conducted at the reserve every weekend. - The best way to get to Sungei Buloh is by boarding Kranji Express from Kranji MRT Station, which operates 8.30-17.45 everyday.
- Migratory birds are best spotted during September-March period. Make sure you bring a binocular so that you can observe these unique birds from a respectful distance.
- Singapore's well-conditioned and hygienic indoor environment may make you forget that it's still in Southeast Asia after all. Humid, hot environment is to be expected in Sungei Buloh, so wear breathable clothes and bring insects repellent."
128,World's First Salmon ATM,Singapore,"Frozen in Norway, vended in Singapore.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-first-salmon-atm,"In January of 2019, a new ATM was unveiled in Singapore’s Wisteria shopping mall. Instead of cash, however, this machine dispenses 200-gram fillets of frozen salmon from the fjords of Norway. Today, dozens of salmon ATMs dot the island city-state. Manish Kumar, founder and CEO of Norwegian Salmon Pte Ltd, has a stated goal of making his beloved salmon available to all and affordable for everyone. By cutting out the cost of storefronts, staff, and distributors, he’s able to sell his fillets for S$5.90 ($4.25). And by holding them under -4 degrees F in each vending machine, the fish stays fresh for up to two years. Thanks to promising first quarter sales, though, it’s unlikely any fillets will stick around that long. The company decided on Singapore because of the country’s vending-machine culture (Singaporean machines vend everything from ice cream to luxury cars) and affection for Norwegian salmon. With locations in shopping malls, commercial areas, housing condominiums, and suburban areas, Norwegian salmon is now available to salmon-loving Singaporeans in 61 locations, 24/7. In an interview with RiceMedia, Kumar noted, with apparent satisfaction, “There have been many cases where customers buy salmon after midnight.”  The ATMs do not take cash, and the fish is dispensed frozen. The original ATM is located on the first floor of the Wisteria Mall."
129,House of Tan Teng Niah,Singapore,"This house is one of the most colorful in the country, and is the last remaining example of a historic villa.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-tan-teng-niah,"This vividly colorful house was constructed in 1900 by a local businessman named Tan Teng Niah. At the time, the neighborhood was an industrial zone (Tan’s candy and rubber factories were located nearby) and many of Singapore’s ethnic-Chinese businessmen lived in similar villas. Amid Singapore’s rapid economic growth and social change during the 20th century, the neighborhood evolved into what is now known as Little India. Most of the old merchant houses were razed to make way for modern commercial buildings and sleek skyscrapers. However, the Tan Teng Niah house survived, and during the 1980s, it underwent a full restoration to what people see today. Believed to be the last such house in existence, it’s now preserved under landmark status from the National Heritage Board. Although the house’s historical background is interesting, the key to its popularity among locals and visitors is its current appearance. The exterior is painted in a rainbow riot of vivid colors, with every element—each individual slat, molding, panel, and pilaster—in a different hue than its neighbor. An array of sky blue, avocado green, traffic-cone orange, highlighter yellow, and nail-polish pink shades adorns the house. Further embellishments beyond the psychedelic color-palette include gilded Chinese calligraphy, intricate floral lunettes, and a bamboo-tiled roof. The house is now used as a commercial space, and recent tenants have included a pharmacy and a business training school. Quite the ordinary activities, within one of the most extraordinary buildings in Singapore.  The house of Tan Teng Niah is located at 37 Kerbau Road, a block away from Little India MRT Station."
130,Katong Antique House,Singapore,This jam-packed Singapore antique museum preserves the fading remnants of a uniquely mixed culture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/katong-antique-house,"Decorated with intricately painted green tiles and painted a cheery yellow, the Katong Antique House is a treasure trove of Peranakan antiques. The two-storied shop house is located in Katong area in the east of Singapore, where many old Peranakan families live. Run by Mr. Peter Wee, a fourth generation Peranakan, the Katong Antique House is more than a museum for Baba-Nyonya artifacts and a shop selling Peranakan goods, it is a tableau of the Peranakan presence in Singapore. The Peranakans refer to the descendants of Chinese who immigrated to the Malayan Peninsula and the Indonesia Archipelago between the 13th and 15th century. These immigrants adopted some Malay customs and traditions while retaining some of their own; some say they retained the original Chinese traditions much better than the Chinese who remained in China as they were unaffected by the eradication of culture during the Cultural Revolution. They eventually went on to develop their own culture and language based on that of their adopted countries. When Singapore was colonized in 1819, some Peranakans moved to the tiny island state and befriended the English colonialists, thus beginning their history in Singapore which Mr. Peter Wee has spent his life striving to preserve. Adorning the walls of the old shophouse inherited from Wee’s maternal grandfather are Peranakan prints and portraits. Peranakan crockery, costumes, and furniture fill the space. The influences and origins of the Peranakan culture are evident in these antiques. The baju panjangs (long dress) and batik sarongs are reminiscent of the native Malay dresses. The intricate kasot manek, handmade shoes with beaded designs, have beautiful motifs of fish, flowers, phoenixes and dragons, similar to the motifs found in Chinese designs. These motifs are found all over the furniture in the store, in the legs of tables and sides of cupboards, each associated with something the Chinese value like prosperity, fertility, longevity and wealth. Wee has dedicated most of his life salvaging these treasures from the bins of Peranakan families whose young do not know of their family histories. His small museum-store preserves the remnants of Peranakan heritage abandoned by the unsentimental nature of the modern local. If you are ever in Singapore, this place is a must for those wishing to examine an integral part of Singapore history before it fades into history."
131,Keppel Hill Reservoir,Singapore,A former reservoir that was only recently discovered after more than 60 years of disuse.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/keppel-hill-reservoir,"Situated on a small hill that leads up to Mt Faber, the abandoned Keppel Hill Reservoir serves as a hidden sanctuary for thrill-seekers and urban explorers. Although its origins are unknown, it dates back more than a century, yet was absent from official maps for decades until it came to the attention of the National Heritage Board and local media in 2014. Roughly one-third the size of an Olympic swimming pool, the enclosed body of water once served the needs of nearby residents, although its use shifted from hydration to swimming and leisure. The remnants of a diving board are still visible, and maps from the era of Japanese Occupation label the area as a swimming pool. Just as the reservoir may have brought bouts of laughter and enjoyment, it was also the site of some tragedy: Newspaper reports from the mid-1900s note several deaths due to drowning. Emerging out of the jungle, the reservoir feels like a secret, if not a fairy tale. Nonetheless, it fell into disuse, possibly because its paltry size made it an ineffective water source. Today it is overrun by vegetation and overhanging branches that can exude a menacing aura. Still, the Keppel Hill Reservoir is evidence that much remains to be discovered even in the dense urban jungle that is Singapore, and that such landscapes still exist in the liminal space between public consciousness and history.  From Harbourfront MRT station, a 15-minute walk will take you to Wishart Rd. Turn right and walk up Keppel Hill. At the fork, take a left and follow the stone path all the way into the foliage where you will be greeted by the sight of the Keppel Hill Reservoir. Turning right at the fork would lead you to 11 Keppel Hill, which was formerly known as Keppel House. While the site is in a public park, local authorities advise caution when exploring, as the reservoir has not been prepared for visitors and has potential to support wildlife. As of 2019, the organization My Heritage offers a tour that includes a visit to the reservoir."
132,Bukit Brown Cemetery,Singapore,One of the largest Chinese cemeteries outside of China spent years overgrown and forgotten.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bukit-brown-cemetery,"While exact numbers are not available, an estimated 100,000 people lie buried within the 0.86 square kilometers (212 acres) that comprise Bukit Brown Cemetery. However, final resting places are not so final in this crowded city-state, and now this unique cemetery set aside for Singapore’s Chinese residents faces disruption to meet the relentless demands of development. Originally owned by private Chinese clans for burials, the site became an official municipal cemetery in 1922. However, the new plots sat dormant for months despite the pressing need for burial grounds, as the Europeans that laid out the cemetery did not take into account the feng shui requirements of Chinese burial plots and thus had to re-plot much of the land. As several million Chinese migrants either passed through or settled in Singapore, Bukit Brown Cemetery is a significant feature of the city’s cultural history. Many famous Singaporeans (of all classes and statuses) are buried there, drawing from very diverse origins including Hokkien, Hainanese, Cantonese, Hakka, and Teochew. The tombs range from the tiny to the impressively grand. Beautiful, unique Peranakan tiles adorn many of the graves, attracting attention and study from ceramic experts from around the world. Laying largely dormant since 1973, Bukit Brown Cemetery has become overgrown and forgotten. Now that construction of an eight-lane highway promises to necessitate the exhumation and relocation of thousands of bodies, efforts are underway to plot and record all of the cemetery’s residents. This is, however, a difficult task, as documentation is very limited, and new tombs are still being discovered. In addition, Bukit Brown Cemetery is also known for its lush greenery which serves as a home for a wide array of animals such the Changeable Hawk Eagle, the Large Flying Fox and other threatened species. The Friends of Bukit Brown (aka the “Brownies”) are working hard to raise awareness about this precious cultural heritage site. Bukit Brown MRT Station is easy to get to. Wear pants if you want to explore; the bulk of the place is untended, overgrown grounds. Wear sunscreen and bug spray and bring lots of water. Watch out for stray dogs."
133,CHIJMES,Singapore,A historical convent known for taking in bad luck babies left on its doorstep is now an upscale shopping center.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chijmes,"The bustling civics district of Singapore contains a plethora of historical and religious sites that have been converted into museums and galleries for tourism and heritage purposes. The one site that stands out most is the CHIJMES (pronounced as “chimes”) said to be Singapore’s version of London’s Covent Gardens. Designed by George Coleman, CHIJMES (Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus Middle Education School) is a huge complex of buildings of great architectural diversity, ranging from Anglo French Gothic to Neoclassical. All over the complex are intricately designed metal staircases, handmade stained glass windows and tall grand spires. Although CHIJMES has features of such grandeur, its beginnings were more humble than what its exterior would suggest. CHIJMES started out as a convent school set up in 1854 by French nuns of the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus, a religious institute of Religious Sisters founded by the French Minim friar, Father Nicholas Barré. At the request of Father Beurel the priest of the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd, the institute sent a group of nuns to set up a school for girls in Penang and Singapore. The Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus had a mission to help the disadvantaged in this South East Asian island. It served as a school, pioneering education for girls in a time when many locals were poor and education for girls was not considered important. It also served as an orphanage as many poor families could not afford to keep all their children. One of the most famed features of the former convent is the modest Gate of Hope. While the small grey door may seem less grand than expected, it was a symbol of hope for many of the babies who were left there. Due to poverty, many families left usually female babies there for the nuns of the convent to care for. Female babies born in the Year of the Tiger were also often abandoned there as well by Chinese families who believed that female Tiger babies brought bad luck. These orphans were given a free education and home within the walls of this convent. Another famed feature would be the first building of the complex, Caldwell House which originally served as the residence of a Senior Magistrate’s Clerk before being bought by the sisters to serve as their headquarters. The other buildings were added around it in later years to become what was colloquially known as the Town Convent. However part of the original nuns’ quarters was demolished to make way for SMRT(Singapore Mass Rapid Transit) offices. Even though the nuns eventually moved out of the school in 1984, they did not stop helping the disadvantaged and educating the girls of Singapore. Before their final year in the Town Convent, the nuns had set up various convents for primary and secondary education all over Singapore, each bearing the name of the Holy Infant Jesus, from CHIJ St Nicholas to CHIJ Kellock in the years before. Today it serves as a high end retail complex of shops, bars and restaurants and hence revamped as CHIJMES, a play on words using the original name of the convent CHIJ. Its beautiful Gothic chapel is often used as an entertainment venue for parties and weddings. CHIJMES won a Merit Award in the UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2002. While 160-year-old CHIJMES has not been a place of learning and sanctuary in years, this place still holds great value in the hearts of many convent girls and is an integral part of Singapore’s history."
134,German Girl Shrine,Singapore,A Singapore shrine to an unnamed German girl who has become a local deity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/german-girl-shrine,"Nestled in the lalang grass of Pulau Ubin, a tiny island off the coast of Singapore, is a small mysterious yellow hut that houses the century-old German Girl Shrine. The hut contains an altar with eerie feminine items like nail polish, brushes and lipstick, offerings to the German girl represented by the doll encased in a box at the center of the altar. The shrine was made to store the remains of a German girl who lived and died before WWI. Her parents had owned a plantation on the island. Before the war broke out, the British came upon the island and rounded up the plantation owner and his family. The daughter, believed to be about 18 years old, escaped the British but not death as she fell off a cliff into a quarry. Her body was found the next day by the Boyanese who had worked for her father. Out of respect, they buried her. Years later, locals took her remains and her silver crucifix and stored it in an urn they placed in the shrine. Over time, the girl in the shrine somehow became a Taoist deity in the eyes of the people, stranger still since the girl had likely been Roman Catholic when she was alive. The shrine became known to gamblers all over the region, attracting those from the mainland and Malaysia who still make offerings of nail polish and dolls for blessings of luck and health from the German girl. In 1974, quarry company Aik Hwa gifted the shrine with a Jiangsu urn to store the girl’s remains, but tragically the urn was later stolen by vandals, along with the remains of the German girl and her silver crucifix. Although many know that her remains are likely no longer on the island, the German girl’s worshippers and devotees still believe that her soul and powers are still active on the island whose history she had become a part of. Near Ketam Quarry on the West side of the island. Follow the Ketam bike trail and the signs will lead you to the shrine. It is no longer in a small yellow hut, but is now in a more permanent concrete building. You are required to remove your shoes before entering."
