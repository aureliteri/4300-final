0,Ta Prohm,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",A battle between nature and architecture in the Cambodian jungle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ta-prohm,"Had Ta Prohm been diligently maintained from its construction in 1186 to the present day, it would be just a footnote to the larger Angkor Wat temple. But while Ta Prohm lay forgotten and neglected by men, the Cambodian jungle wasted no time in devouring it. Silk-cotton and strangler fig trees took root in the loosened stones of the temple, which was built entirely without mortar. Their roots wound through the structure, creating an astonishing merger of nature and architecture. Built at the height of the Khmer Empire by Jayavarman VII as a Buddhist monastery and center of learning, Ta Prohm (known as Rajavihara back then) has a traditional Khmer structure consisting of a series of gradually smaller enclosures, the largest of which is about 1000 by 650 meters. The sanctuary is centered around the huge, elevated stone face of Prajnaparamita, the personification of wisdom, whose features were modeled after those of the king’s mother. When Angkor was rediscovered in the early 20th century by French archaeologists, all of the temples had become overgrown–but none so spectacularly as Ta Prohm. Nevertheless, as they excavated and restored the other temples, the archaeologists had to make sure that the giant tree roots enveloping Ta Prohm would not further deteriorate the structure or make it dangerous to visit. Though Ta Prohm may look like nature unfettered, the appearance of neglect is in fact fastidiously maintained. Ta Prohm’s popularity has soared in recent years along with the rest of the Angkor complex, but especially because of its appearance in the movie Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. Be sure to check out the controversial Dinosaur of Ta Prohm–a corner of the Ta Prohm temple with a strange story of its own. Another contributor to the rising popularity of Ta Prohm was the inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1992.  Flights into Siem Reap Airport are a short jump from Phnom Penh or Bangkok. The best months to visit the temple complex with smaller crowds is the wet season from May to October."
1,Bokor Hill Station,"Kampot Province, Cambodia",A former French military respite turned jungle tourism hotspot.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bokor-hill-station,"One of the first things anyone notices during a visit to Cambodia, is the unbearable heat. Sweltering and oppressive temperatures and humidity beat down on travelers wading through the dense tropical jungles of the Southern region. Incidentally, when a larger and more aggressive group of travelers, the French military, made their way through the country, they also found the weather brutal and unforgiving. As the unfamiliar temperatures began killing off French troops, the occupying European power needed to create artificial respite. Their answer to the tropical problem was Bokor Hill Station, a small resort town for French soldiers in the region. Construction finished in the early 1920s, and the result was jungle chic. Instead of building a small outpost to keep soldiers cool and dry, the French opted for opulence, and a small elegant city was born. Bokor Hill was built with the basic amenities of a post office and church. It was also featured the over-the-top Bokor Hill Hotel and Casino, which stands as a monument to French occupation in Cambodia. When civil war broke out in the 1940s, the French headed back to Paris, leaving the station abandoned and open for use by various military regimes including the Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge. Continuous war throughout the 20th century left the station gutted and eerily decaying in the center of Phnum Bokor National Park. Only one completely ruined road leading to the relic still exists, and is a bumpy ride up more than 3,500 feet to the station. Recently, a private investment group has outlined a plan to rebuild the road and restore the area, creating a larger Bokor Hill city complete with a casino and golf course, making Bokor once again a stop for invading foreigners in the southern jungles of Cambodia. The project is now well under way, as can be seen in some of the photos. The red lichen on the walls has been covered with a layer of thin concrete making the building look newer, even at the cost of the old charm. The casino has been built, though the locals consider it an eyesore. Behind the temple is Wat Sampov Pram, Temple of the Five Ships, where rock formations look a great deal like sailing ships when the fog the normally enshrouds the mountain is clear enough to let you see them and the spectacular view of the valley below. Farther down the road, but still on the mountaintop, is Popkvil, Waterfall in the Clouds. it is a popular destination and worth the short ride from the old casino. Between the two, along a back road, is an area called 500 rice fields; a natural area that looks a lot like the Cambodian countryside in miniature. Across the street and through the guard station is an area teaming with rare carnivorous plants; nepenthes or pitcher plants. This area is perfect for their growth and hundreds can be found along the road. They have garnered a lot of attention in recent years because the young plants can look a great deal like something you might buy in an adult toy store.  Some of these plants can be found in the 500 fields area, but if you are a photographer, it is worth it to pay the few bucks to get into the area where the bigger plants can be found. Update December 2018: The reconstruction is complete and it is no longer derelict.  Around 40 km driving from Kampot."
2,Kbal Spean,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",This Cambodian riverbed is covered in ancient Hindu carvings both above and below the waters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kbal-spean,"Tucked away in the jungles of Angkor, Cambodia is a small river that runs over a series of elaborate carvings that have been etched both along the shore line and into the very stone of the riverbed itself. Created some time around the 11th and 12th century, the carvings at in the Kbal Spean River look like something right out of an Indiana Jones production diary. The designs range from fields of low circles that almost look like holy cobble stones to ornate images of Hindu deities carved in relief on the rocks. Not all of the carvings seem to have originated in the same era, having been added to down the millennia, but today, they all look like they are of a piece. The site is also known as the “Valley of a 1000 Lingas.” This common name is in reference to the low carved circles that were once mound-shaped representations of the Hindu god Shiva, called “lingas.” In contrast there are also a number (though not so many) of designs symbolizing the yoni, a symbol for the Hindu goddess Shakti. The site looks not unlike something that would have come out of a Hollywood storyboard, all fearsome gods and cryptic symbols, barely hidden beneath the jungle undergrowth. Whether you are visiting for a sense of adventure, archaeology, or simple history, the Kbal Spean carvings won’t let you down.  31 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Siem Reap. From the parking lot it's a beautiful mile walk in to the stretch with the carvings."
3,Dinosaur of Ta Prohm,"Siem Reap, Cambodia","Hoax, mistake, or evidence of dinosaurs in human times?",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dinosaur-angkor-wat,"Hordes of tourists descend on Cambodia every year for the sole purpose of visiting the temples at Angkor. This magnificent series of temples, carved out of the jungle in the 12th and 13th centuries by Khmer devaraja, or god-kings, is still the largest group of religious complexes ever created. Yet most visitors miss one of its more intriguing mysteries. At Ta Prohm, near Angkor Wat and built by the epic builder king Jayavarman VII in the late 1100s, a small carving on a crumbling temple wall seems to show a dinosaur - a stegosaurus, to be exact. The hand-sized carving can be found in a quiet corner of the complex, a stone temple engulfed in jungle vegetation where the roots of centuries-old banyan trees snake through broken walls. After parts of Tomb Raider were shot here, the temple got a PR lift and has become one of the site’s top tourist draws. But many of the package tours are still ushered in and out without spotting the enigmatic dinosaur carving. Several different theories have been advanced to explain its presence. Some maintain it’s a recently-carved hoax, while others say that the ancient Khmers could have unearthed a fossil and figured out what kind of creature it belonged to. One theory has it that the image actually shows a cow or rhino with a palm tree in the background - the palm’s fronds being easily mistaken for the fin-like blades running down a stegosaurus’s back. Or maybe the carving is evidence that dinosaurs really did live on until much later than previously thought. (Creationists would certainly like to believe so.) Perhaps here in the humid, ancient jungles of Southeast Asia, where the climate has remained largely unchanged since the dinosaurs’ days, giant reptiles lived on well into the human era - long enough to persist in the Khmer folk memory. If only these walls could talk, we might have a clue.  The carving is located in a corner of a courtyard in the Ta Prohm temple. Look to the left of the central exit."
4,Sambor Prei Kuk,"Prasat Sambour, Cambodia",More than 100 Hindu temples are slowly being swallowed by the forest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sambor-prei-kuk,"Gnarled trees wrap around the ruins that speckle this archaeological site. The centuries-old temples, many of which are capped with grass or shrouded with tree roots, are slowly being reclaimed by the forest. Sambor Prei Kuk consists of a fortified wall enclosing 150 Hindu buildings. An engraving on the main temple of this complex refers to King Isanavarman I, and it is accompanied by a date: September 13, 627. Whether or not this is the exact date when the construction of the temple was completed, it still means that Sambor Prei Kuk predates Angkor Wat by several centuries. Sambor Prei Kuk was the capital of the Chenla Empire (600 to 800). The label of “empire” should be qualified, as it stems from accounts by Chinese emissaries, but it probably referred to a cluster of semi-independent chiefdoms co-existing in a peaceful federation. The site is divided into three groups. Group N (North) and S (South) are both from the seventh century and glorify Shiva. Prasat Sambor (the main temple) belongs to Group N. Group C (Central) consists of more recent temples from the ninth century, including Prasat Boram, a temple famed for its lion sculptures. There are some obvious architectural similarities between Sambor Prei Kuk and the temple found on Angkor Wat grounds. The outstanding lintels, pediments, and columns of Sambor Prei Kuk are precursors of the Angkor style. There are, however, some aspects that are distinctive to Sambor Prei Kuk, such as the 10n octagonal towers, which are unique in Southeast Asia. Of the 150 religious buildings, most are in ruins and barely recognizable, but it is a thrill to wander in the forest and trying to locate some of these buildings, which, at times, blend in seamlessly with the vegetation. As in other archaeological sites in Cambodia, the intrinsic value of these temples is only part of their attractiveness. The other part is the interplay of human-made structures and nature that stands simultaneously as a reminder of the reliance of these ancient buildings and the sobering thought that in the long run, nature will always have the upper hand. But though the archaeological site now feels like a tranquil forest escape, it hasn’t always been the peaceful spot it is today. In the 1970s, a contingent of the Khmer Rouge took refuge on the grounds of Sambor Prei Kuk, and, as a result, the United States bombed the site, damaging some temples. You can still see some of the dips in the ground that the bombs created. To make things worse, it seems that the Khmer Rouge also littered the grounds with mines, which weren’t removed until 2008.  Sambor Prei Kuk is an archaeological site about 19 miles (30 kilometers) west of provincial capital Kompong Thom. The site is open daily from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Caution should be exercised—though these grounds were cleared of all landmines in 2008, it's hard to know with absolute certainty that no mines have been left behind."
5,Phnom Penh Memorial Stupa,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia","5,000 skulls in memorial to those killed by the Khmer Rouge.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phnom-penh-memorial-stupa,"After the Cambodian Civil War ended, the vicious rule of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge began. From 1975-1979, they killed 1.7 million people out of a population of 8 million. Many of those murdered were buried in mass graves in what has come to be dubbed the “killing fields.” In Phnom Penh at Choeung Ek, a memorial was erected to remember those who were killed at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. At the site, the remains of an estimated 10,000 people were found. The memorial was then constructed so as not to obscure the facts, but to show the grisly and honest truth. Designed in the style of a Buddhist stupa, the Choeung Ek memorial has glass sides, and is comprised of multiple layers of human skulls. Totaling 5,000 of those executed at the site, the skulls are a harsh reminder of a genocide that took place only 40 years ago. The memorial is particularly disturbing upon closer examination of the skulls, many of which bear marks of the trauma they suffered before their execution. Along with the stupa, Choeung Ek still has a number of pits that were used as mass graves, and some human bones can still be seen in the area. The Cambodian government encourages visitors to see the site, and never forget the atrocities committed during the Khmer Rouge regime. For more information on amazing ossuaries, charnels and skeletal remains around the world, visit Paul Koudounaris’ website Empire de la Mort, or purchase his definitive book  The Empire of Death: A Cultural History of Ossuaries and Charnel Houses."
6,Killing Caves of Phnom Sampeau,"Krong Battambang, Cambodia","Limestone caves in the Cambodian countryside, once the site of genocide, now a place of peaceful beauty.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/killing-caves-of-phnom-sampeau,"The Killing Caves of Phnom Sampeau (also known as Phnom Sampov) are a place of beauty, turned tragedy, turned beauty once more. The cave are located halfway up a mountain which is dotted with beautiful wats, statues, and lookout points over the village below. Macaque monkeys roam the mountainside, and millions of bats can be seen at dusk. Stairways snake up the mountain and back down again into limestone caves and canyons. One of these caves is the Killing Cave. From 1975 to 1979, 1.7 million Cambodians were killed at the hands of Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge soldiers. These are the bones of doctors, teachers, men, women and children who were killed by the Khmer Rouge at this site. At the top of the cave is the natural skylight which the Khmer Rouge marched people to, lining them up, then bludgeoning them and letting their bodies fall into the darkness below. The site has now been turned into a memorial to those who lost their lives at this site. The descent into the cave is quite beautiful—the rock is covered in green vegetation and low-hanging vines. The cave is quite large inside, and a huge golden Buddha reclines in the center of the room. But at the bottom of the stairway sits a chicken-wire cage full of bones. The atrocities that took place in this beautiful spot suddenly become very present. To the right is another memorial of human remains, these encased in a glass box. Today a mix of mostly Cambodian tourists mills around the cave, and people sing and take pictures. It is a surprisingly jovial atmosphere considering the horror of what took place. But as many Cambodians will explain to you, joy is the best way to move past tragedy.  A hill 7 miles (11 km) southwest of Battambang"
7,Preah Vihear Temple,"Kantuot, Cambodia",This impressive clifftop temple was once at the center of an international custody dispute.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/preah-vihear-temple,"Sitting majestically atop a perilous cliff among the Dângrêk Mountains, the Preah Vihear Temple is a gem of Cambodian temple architecture, although for a long time, many fought for this jewel to belong in Thailand’s crown. A temple has existed on the site since the 9th century, but the elaborately detailed complex found here today dates back to around the 11th century. It was built by the Suryavarman kings who were replicating the glorious intent of the nearby temples at Angkor. While the temple buildings at Preah Vihear are not as glorious as those at Angkor, they were meant to represent the same holy pinnacle. The whole complex is set up in a long horizontal line along the edge of the cliff, comprised of multiple structures, each impressive in their own right. As the Dângrêk Mountains have borders belonging to both Cambodia and Thailand, the site’s ownership became an issue between the two countries when the temple was rediscovered in the early 20th century. Both sides wanted to own the ancient site and its rich trove of artifacts, and the dispute even went to The Hague. In 1962, the matter was finally settled when the international court decided that the temple belonged to Cambodia, a ruling that stands today.  Although open from the Cambodian side, the Thailand side is often blocked."
8,Phsar Thmei (Central Market),"Phnom Penh, Cambodia","One of the biggest markets in Asia, under one of the continent's largest domes.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phsar-thmei-central-market,"Phsar Thmei, also known as Central Market (the name actually means “New Market”), is the largest market in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, and was once said to be the most expansive in all of Asia. It also has the distinction of sitting under one of the largest domes on the continent. Before the completion of Phsar Thmei in 1937, the area on which the market now stands was occupied by a swamp fed by runoff water during the rainy season. For the French Protectorate of Cambodia, who was in charge of Phnom Penh at the time, having a swamp in the middle of their city was far from ideal. So they drained it and set about building a huge market, designed by Jean Desbois and supervised by French architect Louis Chauchon. At the time of its construction, Phsar Thmei was said to be the largest market in Asia. But despite its grandeur, it nonetheless had a troubled start. Flooding was a problem, perhaps unsurprisingly given its location in a favored gathering point for runoff water. Then came the Franco-Thai war (1940–1941), during which the market was bombed by Thai aircraft, causing extensive damage. It was closed temporarily and rebuilt after the end of World War II. It later fell into an undeniably shabby state, until the French Development Agency completed a $4.2 million renovation in 2011. It remains one of the largest domes in Asia, measuring 148 feet (45 meters) in diameter and 85 feet (26 meters) high. To say that the market is somewhat incongruous with the rest of central Phnom Penh would be an understatement. With its huge yellow dome and four extending “legs,” it looks—from the air at least—as if a Barbarella-esque Art Deco space robot planted itself in the middle of the city. Walk inside, however, and you’ll find yourself in a vast, cool, and always buzzing market under the towering central dome, with more stalls spreading along the four adjoining wings. Despite the often inflated prices, especially for visiting tourists, Phsar Thmei is the best place in the city for browsing. It’s packed full of all kinds of goods, from impressively intricate gold and silverware to souvenirs, antique coins, electronic goods, clothing (imported and traditional Cambodian), flowers, and an impressive array of dubious watches. And when hunger strikes, the market also has a colorful fresh produce section and plenty of food stalls selling classic local dishes. It’s the best place to escape from the heat, as it is naturally cool inside.  Phsar Thmei Market is located at Street 128 (Kampuchea Krom) in Phsar Thmei 1 Commune, Daun Penh District. It's open daily from 6.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. There's a taxi rank near the northwest corner of the market, and a bus stop near the southwest exit."
9,Well of Shadows,"Krong Battambang, Cambodia",A gruesome memorial for those lost in this area during the Khmer Rouge genocide.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/well-of-shadows,"The Well of Shadows is a memorial for those lost in this area during the Cambodian genocide at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. At the top, skulls of the dead are encased in a glass box—at the bottom, bas-reliefs depict the horrors that took place in the woods and rice fields surrounding the memorial. The victims commemorated by this memorial were held at a nearby temple which was seized by the Khmer Rouge and turned into a prison. An estimated 10,000 people were killed there, of the estimated 1.5-2 million deaths that occurred between 1975 and 1979. Reliquaries such as this, displaying the skulls and bones of victims that have been found, dot the country. These remains ask us to remember the atrocities committed. The bas-reliefs circling the bottom of the memorial are more unique. They illustrate in detail the particulars of different ways in which men, women, and children were tortured and killed. While the piles of remains show us the sheer numbers, these images bring home the horrors in vivid detail. The inscription on the memorial, with characteristically Cambodian optimism, reads, “The full extent of Cambodia’s tragedy will never be known. The remains of some of the victims of this genocide may never be recovered, nor their murderers identified. But the gentle and forgiving Khmer are energetic and optimistic people and will now walk confidently through the well of shadows to reclaim their ancient culture and restore this beautiful land to become again, the legendary paradise of celestial Apsaras.”  6 kilometres north of Battambang, on the east side of the Sangkar River"
10,Battambang Bat Cave,"Banan, Cambodia",Take a hidden path to the mouth of the cave to watch millions of bats swarm at sunset.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/battambang-bat-cave,"Just down the road from the Killing Caves of Phnom Sampeau, visitors gather at sundown for an incredible spectacle of nature: the nightly exodus of a gargantuan colony of hungry wrinkle-lipped free-tailed bats. Most spectators convene at the bars and stalls on the side of the road, where food and drinks (and cover) are available. But for those wanting a more intimate experience, you can have a local guide lead you up the hidden path to the mouth of the cave. Standing so close to the cloud of flying creatures whooshing out of the cave is an enthralling encounter. The bats won’t hurt you—they’re too busy hunting for bugs to even care about you—but the swarm is so large and furious you can actually feel the temperature rise as they soar overhead. The bat population is so high it can take upwards of 20 minutes for the cave to clear. Once they’re out, it’s amazing to watch the animals streak across the sky. The hordes of flying bats seem to paint the air with fluid black shapes, forming a series of striking images against a sky tinged with the last bits of sunset colors. Phnom Sampeau is about 30 minutes south of Battambang. Hire a car or a tuk-tuk and visit the nearby Killing Caves for a sobering experience."
11,Bamboo Trains,"Ratanak Mondul, Cambodia",A quick and simple solution to Cambodia's train woes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bamboo-trains,"Cambodia’s rail system was, for years, a cruel joke. It consisted of a single line. Trains seldom ran. When they did run, the warped, gapped, sometimes missing tracks provided a ride that maxed out around 20 miles per hour and could easily double the time of any other form of transportation. Again, that’s if the trains ran. The “Bamboo Trains,” or “noory” have been a source of transportation, commerce, and communication for those living in parts of Cambodia where access to solid roads, buses, and other automobiles was for years underdeveloped or non-existent. Unlike the hulking carriages and engines of the national line, the bamboo trains are a tinier, simpler affair—a masterpiece of necessity engineering. The body of a norry consists of a single queen-size platform, often made of bamboo, which lies on a metal undercarriage. Steel wheels on a pair of axles lie underneath. A belt wraps around the rear axle and is connected to a lawnmower or boat engine mounted on the rear of the platform. The driver yanks a cord to start it up, the engine emits its mosquito-on-steroids whine, and down the tracks it goes. Nearly a dozen passengers, livestock, or produce and other goods (or any combination thereof) can come along for the ride. The bamboo trains connect small villages and provide a means of transport for both people and goods in areas otherwise unserved. As it is a single line of parallel rails, with travelers going in both directions, a little etiquette is called for. When two noory meet on this single line of track, the lighter train stops, empties its load, the drivers and passengers disassemble the entire operation, removing it from the track so the other noory can pass. Then, they reassemble it, re-start the engine, and on their way they go, once again. It all takes about a minute. The bamboo trains were once found outside of numerous provincial towns anywhere railroad tracks had been laid. It was possible to take the bamboo trains from Battambang to Phnom Penh. As of January 2018, a new dedicated track has been built for the Bamboo Railway, due to the existing line being restored and reinstated for passenger trains and freight services later in 2018. The norry outside of Battambang are the last in existence. A ride on the bamboo trains, perhaps with a chicken, some dogs, and fellow Cambodians, is a great way to see some of the backcountry and to get a feel (bring a cushion) for just how bad the train tracks once were. All aboard!"
12,Kep-Sur-Mer,"Krong Kaeb, Cambodia",An abandoned Cambodian resort that mirrored the downfall of the country as it was happening.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kep-sur-mer,"Kep-Sur-Mer, or Kep by the Sea, (typically shortened to “Kep”) was born by royal decree in 1908 and spent its early years as a station climatique, a seaside escape for French colonial bureaucrats and their families, but now the abandoned luxury homes form a seaside ghost town. The relative stability following Cambodia’s peaceful transition to independence from France in 1953 encouraged international investment and the development of a Cambodian elite. During this boom, Kep became the premier seaside resort as the elite built villas along the gold-orange coastline. Known by various monikers such as “Cambodia’s Riviera,” or, “The St. Tropez of Southeast Asia,” Kep even flaunted a casino during its heyday. The villas took on a number of contemporary influences, from French colonial wrought iron to Le Corbusier-inspired modernism to New Khmer assertiveness. Cambodia’s aristocracy, including the charmed “Playboy King” Norodom Sihanouk, turned Kep into a Cambodian version of Gatsby’s West Egg during this period of Cambodia’s “golden age.” And like the glitzy Long Island of the 1920s, Kep-Sur-Mer’s dream couldn’t last. Cambodia’s bourgeois began the abandonment of Kep after the Lon Nol coup in 1970. The modernist villas began to fall into decay and Kep saw fighting during the Khmer Rouge takeover, which finally put a stop to any future growth. Some reports suggest the buildings were specifically targeted for destruction by the Khmer Rouge and stripped of valuables by the occupying Vietnamese army following 1979. Today the villas remain overgrown with flora and some, the ones not squatted by local residents, are structurally intact and worthy of, though not necessarily safe for, exploration. Their state of picturesque decay may not last long, however; increases in tourism to Cambodia have brought characteristic increases in foreign and local investment and development. Kep may yet see another “golden era.”"
13,Wat Phnom,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",The capital of Cambodia is named after the hill on which this ancient temple complex stands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-phnom,"Built in 1372, the temple of Wat Phnom stands on the only hill in Phnom Penh, which lent the the Cambodian capital its name. According to legend, the temple was originally built to house four statues of the Buddha found in a tree floating in the nearby river. Back in 1372, or so the story goes, a wealthy widower named Daun Penh came across a fallen koki tree floating in the river near her home. Inside the tree she found four bronze statues of the Buddha. Amazed by this discovery, Penh and her neighbors built a temporary shrine on a piece of raised ground near her house. The locals called the small hill Phnom Penh, or “Penh’s Hill,” in her honor. About 60 years later, King Ponhea Yat, the last king of the Khmer Empire, moved to Phnom Penh. He gave the order to increase the size of the hill, and to build a wooden temple atop it. This was the first rebuilding of Wat Phnom—one of many over the following centuries—and the remains of Ponhea Yat are still housed in a stupa behind the main temple. The main temple was rebuilt in 1434, 1806, 1894, and 1926. Its importance rose and fell over the years, depending on the whims of kings, and extensive renovations were made to fit the ideologies of various rulers, including the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot. New shrines and statues have been added, and the original walls plastered and painted over on numerous occasions. Today, the temple is an amalgam of styles and structures from across its more than 600-year history, including gardens built by the French in the late 19th century and shrines that represent Taoist, Confucian, and Hindu beliefs. The grand main entrance runs up the eastern stairway, its path guarded by lions and naga, the mythical snakes of Hinduism and Buddhism. Inside the temple sits a large bronze Buddha, the walls covered by paintings that tell his story, and murals that recount the Reamker, the Khmer version of the Ramayana. Many more shrines dot the sides and base of the hill, but few are more important than the shrine to Daun Penh, the supposed founder of the wat. The front of her shrine is often crowded with people leaving offerings of food and praying to Daun Penh, and many women come here to pay tribute to the temple’s female founder. Other notable features include a little shrine dedicated to the spirit or genie Preah Chau, which is thought to offer protection from enemies and is especially popular among the Vietnamese community. There’s also the over 200-foot-wide flower clock, originally a gift from France in the 1960s, but replaced in 2000 by a new version given as a gift by China.  Wat Phnom is located north of Road 102, Norodom Boulevard, in the center of Phnom Penh. It's open from 7 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. Entrance is $1, and $2 for the on-site museum. Prepare yourself for a somewhat chaotic scene when you arrive and begin the walk to the top of the hill. Pushy vendors and beggars vie for your attention, but it's easy enough to navigate; just hold on to your wallet. You should also avoid the people selling birds in cages. Often children are the ones doing this. The idea is that you pay to have the bird released, but the birds are typically trained to return to their cages, or they die from the stress of the whole experience. To make things worse, some of the birds are endangered species."
14,Neak Pean,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",A small 12th-century temple surrounded by waters believed to have curative properties.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/neak-pean,"The Neak Pean temple stands at the center of a reservoir known historically as Jayatataka Baray. A wooden bridge leads to a small island in the center of the reservoir, beautiful pink lotuses greet visitors on either side of the pathway. The temple itself stands in the middle of the pond and is dedicated to the Buddhist deity Avalokiteshvara. This central pond is again surrounded by four smaller pools that represent fire, water, earth, and wind. It’s believed that the site is a representation of the mythical Lake Anvatapta in the Himalayas, which was believed to have healing powers. In its heyday, the temple served as a place of rejuvenation and relaxation. People would bath in the different ponds based on their ailments. Today, the temple is a shadow of its former self, but even then, it enchants visitors with its serene aura. It’s near the massive Preah Khan temple in Angkor Archaeological Park in Siem Reap, Cambodia.  The Angkor Temple Pass is required to visit. Head to the temple early in the morning to experience its serene vibes."
15,Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",Khmer Rouge's high security prison.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tuol-seng,"Tuol Sleng is nestled within in the heart of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. From the outside it looks unremarkable: a multi-story former high school with whitewashed walls and grey shutters. However, inside, Tuol Sleng holds a dark history. Under the Khmer Rouge, Tuol Sleng was transformed from a school into Security prison 21 (S-21), a place in which some of the most violent atrocities of the Pol Pot’s regime were perpetrated. Originally named Chao Ponhea Yat High School, the complex includes five buildings in total. Several months after the Khemer Rouge took power in 1975, they implemented measures to convert the high school into a high-security facility. Between 1975 and 1979 it is estimated that over 15,000 people were imprisoned at Tuol Sleng. The prison held between 1,000 and 1,500 occupants along with a large security force. Life within the prison was terrible, and the people imprisoned at Tuol Sleng were treated cruelly. Prisoners were shackled into their cells, forbidden to talk to one another and frequently beaten and tortured by the guards. All prisoners were interrogated during their stay at Tuol Sleng. These interrogations normally included torture: Prisoners were shocked with electricity, burned with irons and water-boarded. In 2010, Cambodia convicted Kang Kek Iew, the chief of Tuol Sleng Prison, for crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and died while still in custody in 2020. Today, the former prison stands as a monument to the brutalities of the Khmer Rouge. It is now a museum dedicated to preserving the memory of those who passed through its gates. Several of the implements that were used to torture the prisoners are also on display along with a “skull map,” a map of Cambodia made entirely from human skulls and bones. Rooms that were once used to torture and abuse are now lined with thousands of photographs of those who were incarcerated there.  Located in the heart of the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. The museum is open to the public from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m."
16,Hanging Temple of Hengshan,"Datong, China",A 5th-century temple improbably built into the side of a cliff.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hanging-temple-hengshan,"The Hanging Temple, located about 60 kilometers southeast of Datong, China, in the Shanxi province, is one of the world’s forgotten wonders. Clinging to a crag of Hengshan mountain, in apparent defiance of gravity, it consists of 40 rooms linked by a dizzying maze of passageways. The temple is said to have been built by a monk named Liao Ran during the late Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534) and restored in 1900. It was constructed by drilling holes into the cliffside into which the poles that hold up the temples are set. Interestingly, the temple is dedicated to not just one religion, but three, with Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism all practiced within the temple and represented in 78 statues and carvings throughout the temple.  The temple is located about 60 kilometers southeast of Datong. It is five kilometers away from the town of Hunyuan."
17,Red Beach,"Panjin Shi, China",A part of the world's largest marsh seems to be growing bright red Martian grass.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/red-beach,"As we look out across the world’s largest wetland area, the swath of marshy flora growing in the shallow waters of Dawa County, China is an eye-popping crimson. A vast luscious landscape surrounded by an astronomical beauty of “red weed”, as if found on Mars. Claimed by French astronomer and author Camille Flammarion — the reason Mars is red is the red vegetation growing on it. Despite its otherworldly appearance, the lush red grasses of this Chinese marsh have all too Earthly, if still rare, origin. The plant is actually a form of Chenopodium (a member of the Amaranthaceae). This specific species is unique in that it can thrive in alkaline soil, or sweet soil. This other worldly landscape is also known as ‘home of the cranes.’ Namely the red crowned crane, among the rarest cranes in the world. This graceful animal is also known as a symbol of luck, longevity and fidelity. Governmentally protected, tourists can walk among the rare reeds via specially installed wooden walkways that extend out over the delicate ecosystem. It is unlikely that this location was an inspiration for H.G. Wells’ War of the World’s weeds, but it makes the site no less unearthly. The area thrives with the world’s largest reed marsh which is reproduced to papyrus-like paper, perfect for writing science fiction stories on."
18,Avatar Hallelujah Mountain,"Zhangjiajie, China",This vertical pinnacle in China was the inspiration for the floating mountains in the movie “Avatar.”,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/avatar-hallelujah-mountain,"It wasn’t until 1982 that China created its first national park: Zhangjiajie National Forest Park. They couldn’t have chosen a better site—Zhangjiajie is famous for its 3,000 vertical pillars, each standing hundreds of feet tall and covered in dense green foliage. These pillars were formed by erosion and draw in upwards of 30 million tourists every year. One of these pillars was named the “Southern Sky Column,” and it stretches 3,544 feet into the air, the length of 78 school buses. In a strange turn of art imitating life imitating art, in 2010 the name was changed to “Avatar Hallelujah Mountain” after the highest-grossing film of all time, Avatar, used photographs of the pinnacle as inspiration for the floating Hallelujah Mountains of Pandora. This was part of a successful attempt to bring more tourists into the national park, using phrases like “Pandora is far but Zhangjiajie is near” and “discover the real world of Pandora.” This, of course, was not all good news for the Chinese government. The state-run “China Film Group” was afraid that Avatar would inspire people to make connections between the plight of Pandora’s fictional “Na’vi” people, who were being displaced from their land for the purpose of economic expansion, and the plight of the millions of real Chinese civilians being evicted from their homes to serve the interests of urban developers. Hence, in a wildly controversial move, just 14 days after being released in China, Avatar was prematurely taken off of 1,628 2D screens. Two weeks too late. By that point Avatar had already become China’s highest-grossing film of all time, and “Avatar Hallelujah Mountain” continues to be the name of the pinnacle, despite the government’s censorship efforts of the film. The connection to Avatar has surged the popularity of Zhangjiajie. To cater to the more adventurous tourists in the area, a new attraction was built in the national park in 2015: the longest glass bridge in the world."
19,Houtouwan,"Shengshan Island, China",This abandoned fishing settlement may well be the greenest village in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/houtouwan,"This fishing village in the Shengsi Islands of China has been abandoned for years, but it is anything but decrepit. On the contrary, Houtouwan may well be the most verdant and stunningly green village the world over, as nearly every building is overgrown with ivy and other lush vegetation. This green gem, situated about 40 miles from Shanghai, was once an active settlement, inhabited by around 2,000 fishermen and their families. In the early 1990s, when the small bay became increasingly unable to meet the growing fish industry’s needs, residents began migrating to the mainland in search of other employment and a better life, a pattern that was common in many small Chinese villages. Slowly, nearly every house was abandoned, and only a handful of residents now remain. Over the past two decades, the forces of green took over, plastering nearly every surface of the settlement with dense overgrown foliage. Adding to the otherworldliness, a peek inside the deserted houses reveals decaying household items and pieces of furniture frozen exactly as they were placed years ago before the inhabitants left. Now, some villagers who used to live in Houtouwan have found another form of income in tourism, showing an ever-increasing stream of visitors the lush landscape, and selling them water, the only item on offer on the island. The scenery is green as far as the eye can see, making this a wondrous sight, and a photographer’s paradise."
20,The Forbidden City,"Beijing, China",The most famous location in China was home to whole dynasties worth of imperial rulers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-forbidden-city-beijing-china,"Possibly one of the most recognizable locations in all of China, this world-famous icon and modern day tourist magnet was once the exclusive estate of China’s ruling class. Separated into an inner and outer court, the Forbidden City forms a rectangle several thousand feet long and wide, with a moat surrounding all four sides.  The huge estate contains five major gates and numerous halls, large and small, each with grandiose names such as the “Gate of Divine Might” and the “Hall of Literary Glory.” Construction began in 1402 and lasted for 16 years, employing over a million workers.  It served as the seat of the Ming Dynasty from 1420 until 1644, at which point it housed the heads of the Qing Dynasty until 1912. After the Emperor Puyi abdicated in 1912, the Forbidden City underwent several periods of turmoil, including the evacuation (some would say theft) of numerous artifacts to Taiwan in 1948 by a fleeing Chian Kai-shek of the Guomindang.  It was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, and today the entire complex is part of the Palace Museum, whose collection includes over ten thousand ancient fans, among other artifacts and priceless works of Chinese art.  Besides the pieces contained inside, visitors can admire the high imperial architecture, as well as a mingling of religious influences including Taoism, Manchu shamanism, and Tibetan Buddhism. Easily one of the most visited locations in China, The Forbidden City is a one-of-kind monument to one of the most culturally rich periods in Asia’s history."
21,Tianmen Shan,"Zhangjiajie, China",999 stairs lead visitors through a massive hole in a mountain known as the Gateway to Heaven.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tianmen-shan,"In almost any condition, China’s Tianmen Shan looks otherworldly, like a portal to something greater than the Earth. Usually shrouded in blinding sunlight or dense fog, visitors climb 999 steps to reach the peak, where they end their trip 4,100 feet up, in a realm where legend believes the gods meet the mortal world. 420 feet high and 180 feet wide, the cave slit of the “Gateway to Heaven” is visible from any distance below the cave. The exhaustive hike up the hill follows an old path of carved stone stairs, dotted with small wooden huts. The entire path is guided by the portal at the peak, but the views on the way up make it obvious why generations of people in Hunan believed that Tianmen Shan was the realm of the gods."
22,Huanglong Travertine Pools,"Aba, China",Intensely colorful calcite pools in Southern China.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/huanglong,"For 2.2 miles in the Huanglong Valley, naturally formed terraced hot spring pools gently flow between rugged mountains and forests. Filled with awe-inspiring creatures known only to China it has been dubbed “Fairy Land on Earth.” Over millennia of geological change, mineral deposits built up and naturally created the travertine pools of Huanglong. Formed out of limestone, the hot springs rose to varied levels, making the light blue water cascade over waterfalls into other series of pools and even hollowing out caves along the valley. With rugged, snow-capped peaks on both sides, the slicing river of hot springs looks almost like a dragon, earning the title of “Yellow Dragon.” In many ways, the backdrop of this UNESCO site is as dramatic as the pools. Untouched forests gently slope toward the water, and Golden Snub-Nosed Monkeys and Giant Pandas have made the fantasy world their home. The most scenic 2.2 miles begin at the Benbo temple and gradually wind their way to the Xishen Cave Waterfalls where the main site ends. Although many incredible environmental sites in China have been faced with mounting pressure from industrialization and business, Huanglong is protected both nationally, and by UNESCO."
23,Zhangye National Geopark,"Zhangye Shi, China",These layered sandstone mountains in China look like they are made of pressed crayons.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zhangye-national-geopark,"What would you get if you mixed rainbow and rock? The Zhangye Danxia Landforms might be an example. Found along the path of the Silk Road in Northwestern China’s Gansu Province, this stupefying array of colorful geology awaits those who are willing to find it. Vivid reds, oranges, and yellows stripe along the mountains in technicolor harmony with rocks allegedly shaped like animals and mythical creatures. This geological park also offers several hiking areas and scenic overlooks to fully enjoy the color. That being said, visitors don’t need to struggle to see the rainbow rocks. Where did the rainbow come from? The answer is not as magical as one might hope: different layers of sandstone dating back millions of years. With erosion, wind, and weather, the colorful layers were formed. But what matters isn’t why there are rainbow mountains, but that somewhere out in the wild, a place like this actually exists. And no, it’s not through the looking glass.  Zhangye is on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway line, and the Zhangye Danxia Landforms can be reached via bus from Zhangye. There are buses within the park to get between sites."
24,Luoxiagou,"Qujing, China",A canvas of crops grow from vibrant red soil in this terraced farmland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/luoxiagou-dongchuan-red-land,"Luoxiagou is one of the places on earth that is hard to believe exists. The internet community has debated its reality, and its sweeping palette of farmland has dropped the jaws of many pragmatists, convinced the landscape has been photoshopped. But it hasn’t. Luoxiagou, a small village in the Dongchuan Red Land, is actually that colorful, and that breathtaking, and truly exists in southern China. The area earned the name “Red Land” due to its striking colors. The base color of the earth in Luoxiagou is tinted with oxidized iron. Nearly saturated with the mineral, the dirt has taken on a dark brown and reddish hue. Yet the soil is only the beginning of the fantastic countryside. Some 26,00 feet above sea level, an ocean of farmland and white flowers grow from farmland splotched with patches of oxidized red dirt. Without much infrastructure or government organization, the region is largely comprised of unaffiliated farmers who plant individual crops on the terraced slopes of the province. Although the lack of organization has left the area underdeveloped, it has also caused the stark differences in color and crop in the swimming farmland of Luoxiagou, and has made the land a stunning natural portrait."
25,Bund Sightseeing Tunnel,"Shanghai, China",This psychedelic tourist trap is a leisurely descent into madness.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bund-sightseeing-tunnel-2,"When trying to cross the Huang Pu River in Shanghai’s bustling Bund district, you can either hop on an inexpensive metro car, or you can take a psychedelic trip through the Bund Sightseeing Tunnel. Located under the iconic Oriental Pearl Tower, the tunnel was built to be one of the Bund’s major tourist attractions, and still manages to draw large numbers of travelers despite costing more than ten times as much as the metro. Although riders do get a rather mind-blowing (if dated) experience. After hopping into a small, futuristic rail car, riders are leisurely carried through a tunnel which is covered in pulsing, strobing lights that attempt to simulate flight through some acid-soaked version of space. The bombardment of flashing lights and colors is accompanied by a rather ominous soundtrack punctuated by an occasional intonation of English words such as “…shining star…” and “…hell…” It is unclear whether the ride is trying to evoke wonder or terror, but both reactions seem appropriate. Despite its name, the Bund Sightseeing Tunnel offers no Shanghai sights other than its own sensory bombardment. The entire ride lasts just under five minutes, but the mind-blowing light show could have much more lasting effects.  Price is 50 RMB one way, 70 for a round trip"
26,Great Wall of China Slide,"Beijing, China",Why walk on this historical site when you can zoom down instead?,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-wall-slide,"Millions of people dream of one day standing atop the Great Wall of China. But at the wall’s Mutianyu section, visitors have the opportunity to experience the world wonder in a much more thrilling way: by whizzing down it in a toboggan slide. Though the majority of visitors to the famous edifice flock to the easily accessible Badaling segment, it’s worth driving just two hours north to Mutianyu. There, after ascending to the top of the Great Wall via gondola, chairlift, or foot, you can return to the base by zooming down a steep, zig-zagging slide, with views of the Great Wall along the way. The ride, which runs adjacent to the wall, lasts about five minutes depending on how much you apply the brakes with the joystick attached to your cart. The average speed on the slide is 12 mph, although a few adrenaline junkies might reach much higher top speeds. It isn’t just for daredevils—celebrities like Michelle Obama and Peyton Manning have taken their turns on the slide, too."
27,Tianmen Skywalk,"Zhangjiajie, China","For those with no fear of heights: a skywalk 4,700 feet up on a Chinese mountain.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tianmen-skywalk,"Tianmen or “Heavenly Gate” mountain is named for the enormous gaping hole in the center of the rock that appears as a sunlit portal to another world. The mountain, which towers over the Zhangjiajie National Forest Park in China, has just acquired even more reason to associate itself with the lofty firmament. A terrifying glass walkway slithers around the vertical cliffs of the mountain, bringing adrenaline junkies to new heights. The skywalk sits 4,700 feet up the mountain, offering breathtaking views and spine-tingling thrills. The crystal clear bridge is 3 feet wide, 2 1/2 inches thick and winds around the mountain for 200 feet. While the landscape imparts a beautiful view of the surrounding mountains, this is one scenic route you’ll want to walk gazing downward. The skyway offers a unique vista of the mountainous summits that launch out of the dense foliage of the park underneath. Clouds sometimes obscure the spectacle underfoot, but hey, it’s not everyday you get to walk on a cloud."
28,Shilin Stone Forest,"Kunming, China",270 million year-old forest of stone.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shilin-stone-forest,"In China’s Yunnan Province is the famous stone topography of Shilin, meaning “stone forest.” Covering an area of three-hundred square kilometers (or 186 miles) the stone forest is a massive otherworldly landscape of karst formations over 270 million years old. Over the millennia seismic activity and water and wind erosion have carved the present-day limestone formations. The giant stalagmite-like pillars create huge arrays of labyrinths that are easy to become lost in. Shilin is divided into many smaller stone forests and features caves, waterfalls, ponds, a lake with an island, and even an underground river. Two of the smaller individual stone forests, Naigu Stone Forest and Suogeyi Village, are a part of the South China Karst, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. One of Shilin’s most famous attractions is the Ashima Stone, which legend says was formed after the beautiful Sani girl, Ashima, ran into the forest and was turned to stone after being forbidden to marry the man she loved. Every year on June 24 the local Sani people hold the time-honored Torch Festival at Shilin, which features many “traditional performances such as wrestling, bull fighting, pole-climbing, dragon-playing, lion-dancing, and the A-xi Moon Dance.”"
29,Yangzhou Zhongshuge,"Yangzhou Shi, China",Mirrored floors and arched shelves create the illusion of an infinite tunnel of books.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yangzhou-zhongshuge,"A bookstore and library in Yangzhou, China has created a bibliophile’s dream. Black mirrored floors shimmer beneath arched shelves that stretch to the ceiling, creating the illusion of a never-ending tunnel of books. A zig-zagging gap prevents the top of the shelves from touching. When reflected on the floor below, the lighting bolt shape, which represents a river, acts as a pathway to entice visitors to drift deeper within the building. People who pass through the tunnel can pause to pluck books from the shelves. Those who carry on trekking through the trippy optical illusion will find additional architectural gems at the end. The tunnel leads to a children’s reading room. Here, a series of LED lights turns the ceiling into night sky freckled with stars that twinkle above bright, whimsical shelves. There’s also an adult reading room full of curvy architecture and, of course, more books to browse. The Shenghai-based architectural studio X+Living designed the tunnel, which was completed in 2016 under the direction of chief designer LI Xiang. They drew their inspiration from the city’s closeness to the Yangtze River and its abundance of arched bridges."
30,Three Natural Bridges,"Chongqing, China","Not one, not two, but three natural bridges remain in this captivating spot post-sinkhole.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/three-natural-bridges,"In Chinese, their names translate into “Sky Dragon”, “Azure (or Green) Dragon”, and “Black Dragon.” These stunning natural stone bridges were formerly caves until the ground collapsed, leaving “tiankengs” (sinkholes) and the breathtaking limestone arches known as Tiānshēng Sān Qiáo. Calcite formations are still visible on some of the walls, and waterfalls with quaint names sprinkle down from on high. An outpost building seated between the first and second bridges was once used for a scene in the film Curse of the Golden Flower. Tourism in this area is still developing, so those who stumble upon it find that this somewhat bemusing location is well worth a visit since it’s not yet swarming with tourists. If you do manage to find it, you will be treated to a ride in a glass elevator to save your legs from a healthy walk to reach the bridges. Or, if you like, you can use the steep, treacherous staircase, 1,000 steps in all."
31,Zhangjiajie Glass Bridge,"Zhangjiajie, China",The latest in a series of long glass bridges suspended at terrifying heights.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-longest-glass-bridge,"Zhangjiajie National Forest Park is full of natural wonders that draw thousands of visitors a day, from misty forests to towering sandstone pillars. Allegedly, its landscape even inspired the scenery of James Cameron’s Avatar. But it’s not rock formations or trees that tourists have been flocking for lately–it’s a bridge. A 1,400-foot-long, 900-foot-high bridge made out of glass. This bridge, opened in the summer of 2016, comes as part of a trend in glass suspension structures. There’s “Brave Men’s Bridge”, located in the same natural preserve as the Zhangjiajie bridge, as well as a swath of other Chinese glass bridges in both urban and natural settings. All of these have been constructed within a decade of each other, each trumping the last in superlatives. The Zhangjiajie glass bridge currently holds the record as both the longest and the highest in the world. The appeal of these attractions is both the ability to see the natural landscape below one’s feet and the element of fear inherent in walking on such a massive structure made of delicate material. As if that wasn’t enough to terrify, one of China’s other glass walkways cracked under the feet of visitors just two weeks after its opening. Though authorities assured the public the crack in the glass was merely superficial and no one was in any danger, it’s understandable why people were scared. When the Zhangjiajie bridge was unveiled, a number of publicity events were staged to prove the bridge’s sturdiness, including driving a car across it and whacking the inches-thick glass panes with sledgehammers. The bridge stood the test, but to ensure safety only 600-800 people are allowed to partake in its glass wonder at any given time."
32,Marobo Hot Springs,East Timor,No one is quite sure of the origins of these idyllic natural hot springs at an abandoned mountain resort.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marobo-hot-springs,"Marobo is an isolated village on the border between the Ermera and Bobonaro provinces in Timor-Leste. Hidden in this remote part of the world, down a bumpy, turbulent dirt road, lay hot springs and the remains of what must have once been an idyllic retreat in a lush, tropical mountain setting. Who built this resort is a matter of contention. Though a few sources claim the Japanese constructed it during World War II, many others say the Portuguese created it during their 500-year colonial stint. The truth might sit somewhere between these two views, with the Japanese renovating and perhaps expanding what the Portuguese had previously started. Who built what exactly may never be known. What is known, however, is that the local population was forcibly mobilized to undertake the construction work in what is clearly a violation of human rights. Today, the only surviving remnants of this resort are a stone building, numerous terraced falls, and the pools, all set in a lush green landscape with a great view of the surrounding mountains. The hot springs produce nearly 530 gallons of water per minute, and have the characteristic pungent stank of sulphur. They also contain a large quantity of sodium and calcium. The highest temperature of the water is approximately 120°F, and is found where the small falls are. The roads from Maliana or from Bobonaro are paved but dangerous, with massive potholes and segments of road that have collapsed. The dirt road leading down to the hot springs is very steep and slippery. To reach this location, you need a 4x4 vehicle or a motorbike, but most of all, you need an experienced driver."
33,Uma Lulik,"Lospalos, East Timor",These sacred totem houses connect the Fatakulu people with the spirits of their ancestors.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/uma-lulik,"The Fataluku people of Timor-Leste (East Timor) are an ethnic minority renowned for their elegant totem houses on stilts, sacred houses called uma lulik. These holy huts symbolize a link between the past and present, the dead and the living. There are traditional uma lulik still in place throughout the indigenous villages of East Timor, as well as several replica houses built more recently to honor the tradition and to display the Fataluku people’s craftsmanship. These homes, which are built or renovated every 10 to 20 years, serve as a bond between families. The rebuilding process strengthens the ties between the past and the present and families that members are born into and those they choose. A uma lulik belongs to a specific family, but it also stands for all other descendant groups that have formed a bond with it through marriages. Ultimately, uma lulik embody the spirit of the family, its network, history, traditions, and, inevitably, its essence. The presence of the uma lulik is as a testament to the resilience of the Fataluku people. First colonized by Portugal  in the 16th century, the island was later occupied by Japan and Indonesia. The indigenous people were persecuted during Indonesia’s 25-year occupation. During this time, many of uma lulik were destroyed or fell into disrepair. In 2002, when the country gained its independence, a resurgence of traditional customs emerged and these sacred homes began appear again. Uma lulik are usually built with local timber, bamboo and twine. Yet, each and every element transcends its physical properties and is charged with symbolism. This mingling of physicality and spirituality is extended to the way each element of the uma lulik is bound together with others to form something higher than itself. The structures are a connection between past and present, those here and those who have gone. Uma Lulik can be found in villages throughout Timor-Leste. The above coordinates are for a sacred house in the Lospalos district."
34,Lake Ira Lalaro,"Lospalos, East Timor",This crocodile-infested East Timor reservoir is also home to a spectacular half-sunken forest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-ira-lalaro,"The East Timor lake known as Ira Lalaro is a gorgeous oasis surrounded by flat grassland on the northern shore and by swamps on the southern shore, but be careful not to get so enchanted that you get eaten by one of the lake’s copious crocodiles. The lake is a self-contained body of water that sits in a depression in the land. The northern shore offers great views of the lake with the mountains and lush forest in the background and the grassland is littered with water buffaloes wallowing in their swimming holes. Bucolic as this might be, it’s the swamps on the southern shore that set this lake apart from the others. The landscape provides vistas of half-drowned trees that reach back like a haunting bayou. While the lake and its surrounds are teeming with all manner of life swimming among the underwater trunks it is the massive population of Estuarine crocodiles that distinguish the lake. It is thought that over 300 of the beasts are packed into the relatively small area. One of the reasons that the animals have nearly taken over the natural landmark is that the native tribe consider the crocs to be sacred totem animals that are not to be hunted. Swamps and crocs are usually associated with the American Southeast but this lake gives the traditional bayou a run for its money. The strangely lovely landscapes of Lake Ira Lalaro may be alluring but they also pack quite the bite.  About half-way between Fuiloro and Tutuala, Ira Lalaro (a lake) can be seen in the distance from the main road on the right hand side. A few hundred metres after the lake ends (going East), a dirt road branches off from the main road on the right. Follow that road for five or six kilometres - until it plunges into the lake."
35,Escola do Reino de Haudere Ruins,East Timor,A surprisingly large and sturdy ruin on the outskirts of a remote village.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/escola-do-reino-de-haudere-ruins,"Not much is known about the once-grand abandoned building that used to house the Escola do Reino de Haudere (Portuguese for “School of the Kingdom of Haudere”), other than it was built by the Portuguese and bears witness to Timor-Leste’s colonial past. The building was one of seven schools built in the late 1920s and early 1930s in what was then the Portuguese colony of Timor, now Timor-Leste (East Timor). While others have been restored and preserved, the Escola do Reino de Haudere was severely damaged during World War II, and fell into disuse after the war. Abandoned for decades, what is left of the ruin is now overgrown with vegetation. This large and enigmatic ruin now greets travelers heading to Baguia, a remote village on the eastern slope of Matebian, the second-tallest mountain in the country. The abandoned school stands on the side of the road that leads to the village, backdropped by dramatic mountains vistas.  Escola do Reino de Haudere is located just over 1 mile (about 2 kilometers) before reaching Baguia. In the village of Baguia a formerly abandoned Portuguese fort built around 1915."
36,Venilale Tunnels,"Venilale, East Timor",These underground shelters dug by the Japanese during World War II later helped East Timor achieve its independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/venilale-tunnels,"Venilale is a sleepy town in inland East Timor known for its cool weather, comparatively speaking. In its colonial past, this town was a prime destination for Portuguese settlers wishing to escape the heat. At the outskirts of Venilale are a set of tunnels that are steeped in World War II history, from when the eastern part of Timor was controlled by Portugal, and the western part by the Dutch. In 1942, Australia deployed troops on the island as a response to the attack on Pearl Harbor. This was designed as a precautionary move, not really expecting Japan to launch a full-on attack on Timor. But East Timor was particularly vulnerable, as the Portuguese were counting on their declaration of neutrality as a deterrent against Japan. (In hindsight, this was an obvious miscalculation.) When Japan attacked, it did so with an unexpected intensity and number of troops. Those Australian and Dutch troops that managed to survive were forced to retreat to the harsh and mountainous interior of East Timor to join another renegade Australian contingent. Timorese people either joined the fighters or supported them by other means, and from here, guerrilla warfare was waged against the Japanese occupation. During the six months that it took Japan to gain control of the island, Japanese forces had to venture farther and farther inland, and Venilale became a Japanese stronghold. It was at this time that a set of tunnels was dug out to be used as shelters. The story may have ended here, but it didn’t. Fast-forward events to 1974, when the Frente Revolucionária de Timor-Leste Independente (commonly referred to as FRETILIN) was founded. East Timor was still Portuguese territory, and FRETILIN was a pro-independence movement whose members were freedom fighters that adopted the guerrilla warfare approach to gain independence for East Timor. In 1975, soon after East Timor gained independence from the Portuguese, Indonesian forces invaded it, and in their struggle against the Indonesian forces, FRETILIN fighters also used the Venilale tunnels as hideouts. The tunnels that were once a reminder of a long and bloody occupation became instrumental to the achievement of the country’s independence. On a side note, Timor-Leste and East Timor are synonymous, but Timor-Leste is the name used by Timorese people. Timor means East in Tetum, the local language, and Leste means East in Portuguese. Basically, whether you use the local or the English forms, the name is still “East-East.”  Venilale is 30 km south of Baucau, the most sizeable settlement in the area. Public transport is sporadic. The best way to reach Venilale is by your own transport. The road is bumpy and many sections are not paved, but a regular car or motorbike can manage easily. The tunnels are not signed-posted, but they are hard to miss."
37,Rock Art at Nino Konis Santana National Park,East Timor,Ancient images hide within the park's caves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rock-art-at-nino-konis-santana-national-park,"Rock art found at Nino Konis Santana National Park consists of paintings created using different colors, but with some rare exceptions, only those drawn in black or dark brown are visible to the naked eye. Among the motifs portrayed in these caves are boats, animals, birds, people, the Sun, stars, geometric patterns, and figures featuring a mixture of human and animal traits. The first caves within the park were explored and studied in 1966. The last nine caves were explored and studied for the first time in 2000. Considering the thick vegetation and rugged terrain, it would not be unfathomable to speculate that more rock art is yet to be found. Carbon dating tests run on human-made findings from the Lene Hara cave show that humans have been living in this region for at least 30,000 years. The dating of the paintings, however, has proven to be more controversial. Some scholars initially claimed that the paintings date back to the Neolithic Age (about 12,000 years ago), but this view has been challenged by more recent research that suggests these images are from as recent as 2,500 years ago. These rock paintings exhibit techniques, styles, and motifs also present on other islands in the South Pacific, including Australia. Techniques and styles can travel a long way, adapting to specific and diverse cultural contexts. Yet, the similarities in motifs suggest that in spite of the significant distance among them, these islands may have shared the same symbolic system. If this is the case, these societies must have had more interchanges with one another than previously thought.  The rock art sites are located on the island's easternmost tip, within the boundaries of Nino Konis Santana National Park. Some can be found near the dirt track leading from Tutuala to Waloo beach, while others are located deeper in the forest. The most commonly known of these sites are Ile Kere Kere, Lene Hara, and Jerimalai. For the caves near Tutuala, you can ask people for directions. They are near the dirt track to Waloo beach, and the path leading to these sites is clear. For caves deeper in the forest, you need to hire a guide."
38,Sia Maubara,East Timor,A haunting place that is now home to thousands of birds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sia-maubara,"Sia Maubara (aka Lago Maubara) is an 8-hectare salt lake set in a natural reserve. Home to thousands of birds, Sia Maubara doubles as a bird watcher’s paradise and historical place. It is all but impossible to visit the lake without sighting Australian Pelicans and numerous other species of birds that call the reserve home. Other birds frequenting the lake include Black Cuckoo-doves, Pink-headed Imperial Pigeons, Jonquil Parrots, Streak-breasted Honeyeaters, and Flame-breasted Sunbirds. Beyond bird watching, Sia Maubara has a tragic history. During the Timor-Leste war for independence, pro-Indonesia elements (including Indonesian soldiers) murdered up to 200 Timorese people in what became known as the Liquiçá Church Massacre. It was said that one way in which the bodies were disposed of was to sink them in Sia Maubara.  The suspicion was eventually confirmed when Australian Marine Divers recovered corpses of twelve victims from Sia Maubara. Despite its violent past, Sia Maubara is a place of unsettling beauty where bright blue water and soil cracked by the heat meet. Dead trees bleached by the sun are scattered along the shore, giving the lake an eerie ambiance that is reminiscent of the lake’s macabre past. Adding to the unease, you may not be the only visitor, as crocodiles may be visiting the lake too.  Coming from Liquiçá, Sia Maubara is located 3 km from Maubara Village. It is clearly visible from the main road."
39,Cristo Rei,"Dili, East Timor",This giant Christ statue was a failed attempt by Indonesia to dissuade East Timor from demanding independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cristo-rei,"East Timor is the one of the most Christian countries in the world, with 99.1% of the population subscribing to the faith. Meanwhile its neighbor next door, Indonesia, is the most populous Muslim country on Earth. While this religious intermingling has caused a few incidences of violence over the years, it also begat a compassionate yet awkward gift exchange. This 89-foot statue of Cristo Rei was constructed in 1996 as a present from Indonesia to East Timor. Indonesian President Suharto wanted to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Indonesia invasion and annexation of East Timor by half-apologizing to the East Timorese people for Indonesia’s decades of occupation. To please the Catholic majority, Suharto, a Muslim, built a giant statue of Jesus standing atop a globe, accessible by a 590-step staircase. The statue was built in the Indonesian city of Bandung, where nearly all of the workers carving the face of Jesus into copper were Muslim. Despite three months of construction and a cost of 5 billion rupiah ($559,000), the Indonesian government failed to appease the majority of East Timorese people. Part of the reasoning for this is that Suharto angled the statue to be facing the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, which caused controversy among the Timorese. The ploy had little effect on staving off the East Timorese independence movement, which the people voted overwhelmingly for in 1999 and ultimately won in 2002. But, like its counterpart in Rio De Janeiro, the Christ statue in Dili still stands."
40,Portuguese Fort Ruins,"Cova-Lima, East Timor",The remains of a former colonial fort on a stretch of beach that is occasionally visited by crocodiles.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/portuguese-fort-ruins,"In the 16th century, the Portuguese started trading with East Timor, and by the end of the century, East Timor had become a Portuguese colony. The Dutch and the British managed to take power for short spells of time in subsequent centuries, but the Portuguese managed to win the colony back. It was not until 1975 that East Timor became independent. After two decades of violent struggle with neighboring Indonesia, East Timor finally formalized its status as an independent country in 2002. In effect, the Portuguese ruled over East Timor for about 500 years, and they mainly relied on Indigenous semi-autonomous governance. They did, however, build a number of military forts for the protection of the territory. Several forts were built throughout East Timor, but very few remains can be found, partly due to the fact that they were usually built with locally found rocks neatly arranged to form a wall and held together by a mineral adhesive that eventually lost its binding properties. One of the most scenic of these forts is in the Southern village of Suai Loro, which also used to serve as the administrative headquarters and prison. Located along the beach, the few walls remaining of this structure are now being reclaimed by a banyan tree. There is no guardian, and no entry fee, but do keep an eye out for crocodiles. It is unlikely you will encounter one, but if you do, be mindful that they are particularly dangerous all along the south coast of East Timor."

The Balibo Trust estimates the fort to be 350-370 years old, and it is believed to be the second-oldest such fort in East Timor. According to the trust’s website, the fort was built by the Portuguese, who wanted to protect their colony of Batugade. Balibó’s height and its location at a crossroads of travel routes made it an ideal strategic location for a defensive structure. Today, the former fort is home to a modern, heritage-influenced hotel, and a café and restaurant with panoramic views from the mountains to the ocean. The Balibo Fort Hotel forms part of the social enterprising overseen by the Balibo Trust, which established the nearby Balibo Dental Clinic and Community Centre, and has made substantial contributions to local schooling infrastructure."
42,Quarry Bay 'Monster Building',Hong Kong,This hulking behemoth is actually five interconnected towers built in the 1960s.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/quarry-bay-monster-building,"There’s a reason Hong Kong earned a reputation as a concrete jungle. Both people and skyscrapers pack its busy streets. One behemoth building in particular offers an astounding visual of its immense population. Its individual units are stacked one on top of the other and create a colorful, cohesive tapestry of homes. Quarry Bay is a densely packed neighborhood in Eastern Hong Kong, with more and more industrial and residential spaces opening each year, but perhaps no building is quite as condensed as the “Monster Building.” The Monster Building, as it’s been nicknamed by locals, isn’t actually a single building, but an E-shaped complex composed of five connecting structures: Oceanic Mansion, Fook Cheong Building, Montane Mansion, Yick Cheong Building, and Yick Fat Building. They were built during a population boom in the 1960s to offer government-subsidized housing for low-income residents. The compound has a similar look to other subsidized housing built in the same decade, when the upper floors of the building were used as residences and the lower floors were used for shops selling tea, fish, and other groceries and household goods. Because of its photo-friendly symmetry and aesthetically striking architecture, the building has become a favorite spot for urban explorers and Instagrammers. The area has been used as a set in multiple films, including Ghost in the Shell and Transformers. With the growth of popularity, photographing the building has become more challenging due to a ban on public access to the inner courtyard.  Take exit A at Quarry Bay MTR Station and walk along King’s Road toward Tai Koo. Remember that this is a private residential area. People live in these apartments and you're a stranger in their yard."
43,Un Chau Estate Flower Tunnel,"Kowloon, Hong Kong","In Hong Kong, a fairytale flower tunnel is hidden within the gardens of a public housing complex.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/un-chau-estate-flower-tunnel,"Every spring, a magical flower tunnel blossoms within an easily over-looked public housing complex. It’s a fleeting, hidden gem concealed among the crowded buildings of Hong Kong. Like a secret garden, the tunnel is covered in vibrant Bougainvillea. Come Spring, the tunnel blooms with a ceiling of pink leaves and tiny white flowers growing along the vines that snake over the walkway. The effect is absolutely enchanting. Walking through the tunnel is like entering a secluded, floral oasis worthy of a fairytale. It instantly makes you feel as though you’ve left the bustle of the city behind and entered a veritable wonderland of nature. The flowers only show up during the Spring, between March and April, adding an extra sense of ephemeral wonder to the experience. The flower tunnel is part of the Housing Department’s plan to add more green spaces to public housing developments throughout Hong Kong. These fleeting springtime wonders, as well as the year-round pockets of greenery, are meant to provide relaxation and also help reduce heat and pollution in the city.  Getting to Un Chau Estate is easy. Take exit C2 at the Cheung Sha Wan MTR station, and you'll get out directly at the Un Chau Estate. The flower tunnel is right at the estate’s entrance, and can't be missed. Travelers should note that the flower tunnel is a popular destination with photographers so it's advised to go early and skip the crowds."
44,Chungking Mansions,Hong Kong,"Teeming with illegal goods and services, this towering maze of vice is also a popular tourist accommodation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chungking-mansions,"The Chungking Mansions are an infamous melting pot of seedy underground activities and vices nestled into one of Hong Kong’s busiest areas. The sprawling building is composed of five residential towers built in 1961 in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong. Aside from headquartering illicit prostitution rings and drug traders, the building’s labyrinthine structure and minimal upkeep have led to a reputation for the cheapest accommodations in Hong Kong, giving the twisting building a legendary status among fearless backpackers. While the 17-floor towers have nearly 2,000 guest-rooms housing nearly 4,000 people nightly, the “Chungking Express” mall on the first two floors remains the main attraction for passerby. After undergoing a massive facelift in the early 2000s, the mall reopened in 2004 with more than 500 stores and restaurants. From curry restaurants to African bistros to black market phone smugglers, the ground floor is a non-stop carnival of shopping and scheming. Despite the recent overhaul of the mall, the building’s residential towers maintain their reputation as a dangerous fire trap due to unsanitary conditions, antique electrical wiring, and blocked stairwells. Even with all of the activities that would rather not be in the spotlight, the building gained a foothold in popular culture via the 1994 drama film Chungking Express and has intrigued academics since the 2011 publication of the book, Ghetto at the Center of the World. Chinese University of Hong Kong anthropology professor Gordon Mathews published the book after spending more than 4 years in the Mansions documenting its residents and operations. Mathews estimated more than 120 different nationalities pass through the Mansions each year along with up to 20% of the active cell phones in sub-Saharan Africa having passed also through the building. All of the academic and high-art representations aside, the most accurate description of the Chungking Mansions comes from The Economist’s 2011 analogy which equated the towering den of vice to the Mos Eisley Cantina, the fictional intergalactic pirate haunt from Star Wars. Apparently in space, people can hear you scheme."
45,Kowloon Walled City Park,Hong Kong,"Remnants of the most densely packed city in world history, that thrived on anarchy for 30 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kowloon-walled-city-park,"At its peak, Kowloon had a population density of 3,300,000 people per square mile. Occupying every inch of hundreds of mid-rise buildings, Kowloon was such a lawless maze of alleyways and secret staircases, that police from the outside world would rarely venture in without a sizable group. There were two main alleys on the ground as well, but they did not get any natural light, instead the city had neon lights that were working 24 hours a day. When it was first built, Kowloon was a military base with walls 13 feet high and 15 feet thick. During the 19th and early 20th century, it traded hands a number of times until after World War II when the Chinese made an attempt to reclaim their rights to the city. Before they could get control, an influx of immigrants occupied Kowloon, making its regulation and governance impossible by the Chinese authorities, as well as the British administration in Hong Kong. Over the next 50 years, Kowloon grew at an enormous rate, swelling the 6.5 acre site to an overpopulated box of anarchy. As more immigrants moved into the city, ten-storey buildings were erected across most of the city, effectively blocking out the sunlight in the alleyways below. Kowloon was so dense and so tightly packed with buildings that one could go across the city North to South on a series of interconnected stairways and paths without touching the ground. As Kowloon became more of a hazardous maze, outside authority in the area dwindled and Triad gangs moved into position. During the late 1950s and 1960s, drugs, prostitution and gang influence reached an apex, and Hong Kong police found themselves unable to gain control over the city-state. In 1973, an attempt to clean up the area resulted in the seizure of 4,000 pounds of drugs, or 1/10 of a pound of illegal substances per person. The city was also home to many small businesses that functioned without licenses, namely 87 dentists, 150 small shops and over 60 doctors. After years of lawlessness, the decrepit city was slated for demolition in 1987, and 6 years later when the eviction process ended, the city was razed. Despite losing most of the remnants of the old city, the southern gate and administrative Yamen building remained intact. Today, Kowloon is a city park, and visitors can stroll the same ground that once held opium dens, triad bars and thousands of people."
46,A Sky Full of Gods and Buddhas,Hong Kong,Thousands of abandoned statues of deities are taken to this hillside in southern Hong Kong.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/a-sky-full-of-gods-and-buddhas,"At the bottom of the stairs in Waterfall Bay Park in the southern part of the Wah Fu district of Hong Kong is a hillside where people bring household deities they can no longer keep. Wong Wing-pong looks after this collection of statues, their self-appointed caretaker for nearly two decades in his retirement. The octogenarian was once a butcher, but now every day he comes to the rocky slope full of statues of Buddha and gods from many religions, though mostly Buddhism and Taoism, where he sweeps away leaves and burns incense as an offering. Wong first came upon this spot on a walk, at a time when it already had around a dozen statues. Since then, he has regularly added to the collection, which has come to be known locally as “a sky full of gods and Buddhas.” In Hong Kong, it is against the beliefs of most residents to dispose of a statue of Buddha or a deity, even if it is broken, so they leave them by the side of the road for someone else either to take or to worship. Wong picks up discarded statues he finds, fixes them if they need fixing, and brings them to this spot. It has become so well known that he doesn’t have to do that as much anymore because people bring their statues directly to him. All of the statues look out to sea. People often visit the collection, which now numbers in the thousands, to worship, whether they have statues that have been incorporated into it or not. This is not the only such shrine around Hong Kong, but it is by far the biggest. The only thing the local government asks is that the statues not block footpaths."
47,Tian Tan Buddha,"Ngong Ping, Hong Kong",Climb to the top of the world's largest seated bronze Buddha.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tian-tan-buddha,"Seated peacefully atop a lotus flower, the Tian Tan Buddha dominates the valley on Lantau Island, Hong Kong. Although its size is average compared to some of the world’s most massive Buddhas, the Tian Tan Buddha holds the distinction of being the largest seated bronze Buddha in the world. Ignoring its size completely, the statue seems more impressive due to its location, in a valley surrounded by densely forested peaks. At 112 feet (34 meters) high, the Buddha can even be seen through the mountains from nearby Macau on a clear day. With eyes closed and right hand raised, the Buddha’s calm and wise appearance seems to control the energy of the valley. The Buddha was constructed between 1990-1993. Adventure-seekers climb the 268 steps to the Buddha’s feet, but the monastery does not discriminate; a ramped path makes the trip up to Buddha’s pedestal accessible for families and the handicapped. The path to the Big Buddha is lined on both sides by the Twelve Divine Generals, each of them symbolizing a different animal from the Chinese Zodiac. Every General is armed with a specific weapon and represents two hours of the day, thus, together they add up to 24 hours. Although access to the site is free, entrance to the Buddha costs money. The inside of the Buddha allegedly holds the cremated remains of the Buddha inside a relic, but even a quick view is going to cost you. Take the Ngong Ping 360 cable car."
48,Lam Tsuen Wishing Trees,"Tai Po, Hong Kong","A pair of trees near a Hong Kong shrine are said to grant wishes, but only the ones they hold on to.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lam-tsuen-wishing-trees,"The Lam Tsuen area of Hong Kong has been inhabited for over 700 years. Its continued survival can be partly attributed to the famed Wishing Trees, located in Tin Hau Temple, which is said to grant any wish that can get caught in their branches. Tin Hau Temple dates back to the late 1700s when it was constructed during the Qing dynasty. One of the nearby trees, a camphor, was said to be able to grant wishes. Thus was the tradition started that has drawn locals and visitors to the supposedly enchanted plants for hundreds of years. Initially, visitors would write their desires on small joss paper scrolls (a parchment specifically used for offerings) and then tie them onto branches or throw them into the tree. The higher the wish got stuck, the better chance it had to come true—but if it fell out, it was not to be. In more modern times, this practice has been transferred to a 200-year old banyan tree. When a couple of large branches, weighed down by too many wishes, broke off and actually injured bystanders, the local government stepped in and outlawed the placing of wishes on the tree. To provide an outlet for everyone’s desire for wish fulfillment, a wooden rack was constructed near the original tree and a whole other fake plastic wishing tree was even built. In 2008, a smaller banyan was planted a few meters from the original banyan version of the tree so that the growing wish tree line would not die out—although casting wishes into the new tree are also outlawed. Most people now make their wishes on the colorful plastic tree in Lam Tsuen, although the wish-granting efficacy of this replacement is not known."

According to legend, when Cheng I died, Cheng Po took up with his adoptive mother and married her, carrying on the family business of pillage and plunder. At his height of infamy he is said to have commanded a fearsome pirate fleet of 600 ships and a veritable pirate army of 20,000 men. Then, in 1810 his career took an unexpected turn when he surrendered to the government and accepted a post as navy colonel and an assignment far from his home waters off Hong Kong, patrolling instead the coast of Taiwan. Cheng Po is said to have squirreled his pirate treasure on Cheng Chau island 6 miles off the coast of Hong Kong. Visitors can follow in his footsteps and climb down into a small cave near the coast and look for themselves, but no treasure has ever been found. The cave is on the southwestern peninsula of the island, and is well marked. Island is 30-55-minute ferry ride from Hong Kong's Central District, and a 2km walk from Cheung Chau village along Sai Wan Rd"

This ship-shaped structure is located in Hong Kong’s Whampoa Docks, which was once one of the busiest shipyards in all of Asia. In the early 20th century, it employed over 4,000 people and built some of Hong Kong’s largest ships. However its prominence attracted some unfortunate company in during World War II when it was the site of a major bombing offensive and occupation by Japan. The dockyards changed hands a number of times after the bombing until, in 1985, the shipyard was transformed into a private housing development for which The Whampoa cruise ship shopping center was erected. Conspicuously stranded in a long pool which used be one of the actual docks, the massive 360 foot-long cruise liner features theaters, department stores, restaurants and even a small theme park. The Whampoa’s devotion to its cruise ship facsimile even extends to a metal finish on the exterior of the building, yet if the docks ever had to be recommissioned the boat would provide more fashion than floatation."
51,Central-Mid-Levels Escalators,Hong Kong,The world's longest outdoor covered escalator system transports commuters through Hong Kong's hilly terrain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/central-mid-levels-escalators,"For most city-dwellers, the daily commute is characterized by congested streets, packed subway cars, or perilous bike rides. But for many commuters traveling between Hong Kong’s Central and Mid-levels districts, the trip to and from work can be as easy as standing in place and holding the handrail while roughly a mile’s worth of covered escalators and moving sidewalks moves them through the surrounding hills. Plans for the Central-Mid-Levels escalator system were proposed in 1987 as a means of transporting a growing population through the island’s challenging slopes. Prior to the project’s completion in 1993, commuters were obliged to take a circuitous route consisting of several miles of zigzagging roads in order to travel between the two districts. The Central-Mid-Levels escalators introduced a pedestrian option that was much more direct. It takes roughly 20 minutes to cover the entire length of the network, which at times weaves its way through residential blocks as well as more commercial areas. Most commuters shorten the trip by walking some or all of the way while the escalators are in motion. The escalators also provide a free, leisurely option for tourists looking to explore the area. Numerous entrances offer ample opportunities to enter and exit in order to investigate nearby restaurants, markets, and shops. Visitors should keep in mind that the system runs in one direction only — downhill during the morning rush hour and uphill from 10:30 am to midnight. A stairwell runs alongside the elevators, providing pedestrian access for those traveling in the opposite direction."
52,Wong Tai Sin Temple,Hong Kong,"Taoism, Buddhist and Confucianism are all represented in this temple that claims to answer anyone's wishes.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wong-tai-sin-temple,"Wong Tai Sin Temple is known for answering prayers and wishes with the practice of Kau Cim, a form of fortune telling that originated in China. The beautifully ornamented temple is dedicated to the Taoist deity, Wong Tai Sin, a shepherd boy born in Zhejiang Province on the eastern coast of mainland China in the 4th century. According to legend he began practising Taoism at the age of 15 after meeting an immortal on Heng Shan (Red Pine Hill) in his hometown. The saintly person taught him the art of refining cinnabar into a medicine believed to cure all illnesses. After spending 40 years in seclusion learning this art, he achieved enlightenment and became immortal. Legend holds that Wong Tai Sin could punish the evil, heal the wounded, rescue the dying, see the future, and make wishes come true. Originally a private shrine for Taoists, in 1934 the Wong Tai Sin temple was opened to the public for the Lunar New Year. The temple survived the wide destruction of Hong Kong during the Japanese Occupation in WWII, which was attributed to Wong Tai Sin’s powers. In 1956, with government approval, the shrine was opened to the public year-round. The huge shrine includes many halls and altars, and though it is primarily a Taoist temple, the shrine also has Buddhist and Confucian worshipping halls. A portrait of Wong Tai Sin stands in the middle of the Main Altar backdropped by wooden sculptures that depict the story of how Wong Tai Sin became a deity. Taoist as well as Buddhist and Confucian scriptures and images are engraved on the walls. The large open space in front of the Main Altar is the main worshipping place. Here worshippers hold bundles of burning incense and bow to Wong Tai Sin three times and then shake fortune sticks until one falls out. The stick is exchanged for a piece of paper with the corresponding number for interpretation by the fortune tellers. The secondary platform contains bronze statues of the 12 Zodiac Animals. Another interesting feature are the five buildings and structures, arranged in a row, representing the five elements in fung shui: the Bronze Pavilion (metal); the Archives Hall (wood); the Yuk Yik Fountain (water); the Yue Hung Shrine (fire), where the Buddha of the Lighting Lamp is worshipped; and the Earth Wall (earth). Located at the rear of the complex is Good Wish Garden, Chinese-style garden which features a miniature replica of the Summer Palace in Beijing, the replica of the Nine Dragon mural in Pei Hai Park in the Forbidden City in Beijing, and a white jade statue of sheep, depicting the miracle of Wong Tai Sin transforming piles of white boulders into sheep."
53,Noonday Gun,Hong Kong,"This naval gun is fired every day at noon, an odd timekeeping tradition the origin of which is local legend.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/noonday-gun,"Situated on a small enclosed site in the waterfront district of Causeway Bay, the Noonday Gun is a Hotchkiss three-pound artillery piece that is ceremonially fired every day at (appropriately enough) noon on the dot. While this practice is somewhat charming in its own right, the details behind the practice—such as the owner of the gun, and the purported genesis of the tradition—provide striking insight into Hong Kong’s British colonial history. The gun is owned by Jardine Matheson, a massive British conglomerate that was one of the first trading houses, or “hongs,” in Hong Kong. The land that is now Causeway Bay was bought by Jardine Matheson in 1841, and was in fact the first piece of Hong Kong sold at public auction by the eager new colonial government. With its roots in Imperial China, Jardine Matheson was involved in shipping tea and cotton, but also made a great deal of money from the illegal opium trade. They built the company’s main offices and warehouses—known locally as godowns—on the newly acquired plot. The Noonday Gun has its roots in a 21-pound gun that Jardine Matheson set up on the waterfront of their commercial fiefdom. According to the commonly related story, the company’s private militia would fire the gun in salute whenever the head of the company (or, in some versions, whenever one of the company’s ships) sailed into or out of the harbor. In 1860, a senior officer of the Royal Navy, new to town and unfamiliar with the practice, found this offensive, as typically only government dignitaries or military officers receive such treatment. As a reprimand, Jardine Matheson was ordered to henceforth fire the gun every day at noon, providing a service in the form of a public time signal. The probable kernel of truth in this story is the gun’s role as a public time signal. This was a common practice in many harbors in the 19th century, allowing all ships within auditory range to correctly calibrate their onboard clocks, which they used on voyages to calculate longitude. Thus, the Noonday Gun is most likely a practical measure that became so common to daily harbor life that it morphed over time into local tradition. The original gun was dismantled by the occupying Japanese Imperial Army in 1941. A new gun was donated by the Royal Navy after Hong Kong  was liberated in 1945; this gun (humorously enough) received noise complaints, and was replaced by the current, smaller gun in 1947. This gun has a history of its own, having seen action in the Battle of Jutland during the First World War. The Noonday Gun was immortalised in the popular (and cartoonishly racist) song “Mad Dogs and Englishmen” written by Noel Coward. The song was first performed by Beatrice Lillie in a musical revue called The Third Little Show at the Music Box Theatre in New York, on June 1, 1931. In 1968, Coward visited Hong Kong and was allowed to fire the gun that he made famous with the lines, “In Hong Kong, they strike a gong, and fire off a Noonday Gun / To reprimand each inmate who’s in late,” going on to observe, “But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun!”"
54,"Noah's Ark, Hong Kong",Hong Kong,A biblically accurate ark located beneath a Hong Kong bridge is fun for the whole Christian family.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/noah-s-ark-hong-kong,"Nestled underneath Hong Kong’s Tsing Ma Bridge is a gigantic full-size replica of Noah’s Ark, the famed biblical ship that rescued pairs of living animals from a global flood. During the late 1990s, the Hong Kong government planned to construct a sprawling suspension bridge connecting the bustling city to a new airport across the Rambler Channel. Complicating matters, however, was an undeveloped island which would be roofed by the new bridge. Miraculously, a unique three-way partnership between the Hong Kong government, a pair of billionaire developer brothers, and a group of Christian organizations emerged with a plan to cover the island with a “remarkable” theme park. The proposed visions for this theme park ranged from the outrageous to the unreasonable before government officials received a design for a massive ark overlooking the water, a design which was scrawled by an eight-year-old Hong Kong girl. The recreated Noah’s Ark was built precisely to the biblical dimensions with a length of 300 cubits (450 feet), and the park markets itself as a creationist and family-centric vacation destination. Though the majority of this theme park’s distinctive attraction is the menagerie of 67 fiberglass animal couples, the theme park houses a wide breadth of activities and exhibits from a solar observatory telescope tower to a seaside café. The attraction encompasses areas such as the outdoor Nature Garden featuring live, rare animal species, an indoor jungle gym with swings and climbing areas called Noah’s Adventureland, and a resort on the top floor for lodging and dining. The park’s management unabashedly and hyperbolically promotes the ark as a refuge for visitors that may be in the midst of their own personal “floods.”"
55,Sun Hing Restaurant,Hong Kong,A half-century-old handmade dim sum joint opens daily at 3:00 a.m.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sun-hing-restaurant,"Tucked away on a busy street of Kennedy Town, Sun Hing is known for serving up heaping steamer baskets of fluffy char siu bao (barbecued pork buns), curried tripe, spare ribs, and Cantonese sponge cake to night owls starting at 3:00 a.m. every day. By the time the sun rises, the place is packed with customers ranging from elderly people sipping tea to students from the nearby university and still-tipsy revelers seeking late-night bites. Opened by Chui Hoi in 1972 and now run by his son, Sun Hing has become something of an institution—one well-worth either getting up or staying up for. While mass-production has crept into many of the city’s pricier dim sum halls, cooks here still prepare everything from scratch, from dainty quail’s egg siu mai to salted egg lava buns with a yolk custard that tastes like warm cake batter. Unlike modern dim sum restaurants, where diners normally check off the items on a paper menu, patrons at Sun Hing can still select their dishes from roving trolley carts. A server marks the table’s card with the corresponding numbers of selected dim sum, then tallies up the bill at the end. Tea is self-service, with a selection of loose-leaf options—including black tea, tie guan yin (Iron Buddha), and pu-erh—perched on a stainless-steel shelf. Diners can also watch cooks in the open kitchen rolling and flattening dough or skillfully folding dumpling wrappers into half-moon shapes. Servers continually call out fresh arrivals and it’s up to patrons to pounce on each new batch of dim sum before another table scoops it up.  Sharing a table with strangers is quite common at dim sum parlors. If you’re flying solo, you may sit with other diners at the same table but separated by plastic partitions."
56,Man Mo Temple Complex,Hong Kong,A serene space tucked amid the skyscrapers of Hong Kong's bustling financial district.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/man-mo-temple-complex,"Man Mo Temple Complex is a delicate building in the shadows of the skyscrapers of the financial district. It represents the traditional social organisation and religious practices of the Chinese community in old Hong Kong. The complex, built between 1847 and 1862, during the Qing dynasty by wealthy Chinese merchants, comprises of three parts: Man Mo Temple, Lit Shing Kung and Kung So. Man Mo Temple is dedicated to two deities, the God of Literature (Man Tai), holding a writing brush, and the God of Martial Arts (Mo Tai), having a sword. Both of them were worshipped by ambitious scholars and students seeking progress in their study or high ranking in the civil examinations of Imperial China. Lit Shing Kung was built for the worship of all the Chinese heavenly gods. Whereas, Kung So was an important assembly hall where community affairs and disputes could be discussed and settled. The complex is a fine example of traditional Chinese architecture and craftsmanship. The temple’s most memorable features are the rows of large red-coloured incense spirals suspended from the ceiling which are burned as offerings by worshippers. They take a couple of weeks to burn through. It provides a serene space in contrast with the hectic pace of the nearby financial district. The temple is also featured in a video game, Shenmue II for the Dreamcast and Xbox consoles. The temple and its grounds can be explored in the game. However, the virtual location of the temple is different from reality."
57,Old Tai O Police Station,"Tsai Po, Hong Kong",A station built to repel pirates now attracts wealthy vacationers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-tai-o-police-station,"Perched over a small fishing village on Hong Kong’s Lantau Island is the Old Tai O Police Station, a 1902 anti-pirate outpost which has been remodeled into a luxury relaxation station in 2012. Built to combat the rampant piracy and smuggling from the surrounding waters, the Tai O Police Station also aimed to instill British law and order throughout the entire island. One of the first police stations built on the outlying islands around Hong Kong, the building consists of two blocks of two stories, linked by a footbridge on the first level. Marked by its amalgam of architectural styles, the building includes arched verandas of the Italian Renaissance, a Chinese pan-and-roll roof, and elements of the Arts and Crafts style. Originally the station was staffed with fewer than ten policemen, and the building increasingly served as an administrative center, peaking with 180 employees in 1983. The low crime rate in the 400 year-old fishing village led to a demoted status as a patrol post in 1996, a role maintained until the station’s closing in 2002. Looking to revitalize a historic building, the Hong Kong government accepted a 2009 developer proposal to convert the station into a seaside lodge. Finished in 2012, the Tai O Heritage Hotel includes nine colonial-style rooms and ocean-view suites and even new roof-top restaurant. However to retain some semblance of its history of law and order, the redevelopment also restored the surrounding cannons, searchlight and guard towers. So be sure not to get too rowdy on your vacation as they also refurbished the jail cells."
58,Chand Baori,"Abhaneri, India","Thousands of exquisitely carved stone water storage wells, hundreds of stone steps fill this exquisite medieval stepwell.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ancient-stepwells-india,"In 1864, the famous French world traveler Louis Rousselet described “[a] vast sheet of water, covered with lotuses in flower, amid which thousands of aquatic birds are sporting” at the shores of which bathers washed, surrounded by jungle greenery. He was not describing a lakeside scene or one of India’s famous riverside ghats, but an ancient well, as big as a large pond. In the northern Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujarat, the problem of water is a profound one. At the edge of the Thar desert, the area sees torrential seasonal monsoons, and then watches the water disappear almost immediately. With summers routinely over 100 degrees, and silty soil that would not hold water in ponds, a practical solution was needed for locals and travelers along the local trade routes. In the first century, the slippery shores of the major rivers were tamed by the construction of ghats, long, shallow sets of stairs and landings. The same approach was applied to the construction of a new kind of well. The earliest stepwells most likely date to about 550, but the most famous were built in medieval times. It is estimated that over 3,000 stepwells were built in the two northern states. Although many have fallen into disrepair, were silted in at some point in antiquity, or were filled in with trash in the modern era, hundreds of wells still exist. In New Delhi alone, there are more than 30. Chand Baori in Abhaneri, near Jaipur, Rajasthan, is among the largest, if not the largest, of the stepwells. It is also perhaps the most visually spectacular: Chand Baori is a deep four-sided structure with an immense temple on one face. Some 3,500 Escher-esqe terraced steps march down the other three sides 13 stories to a depth of 100 feet. The construction dates to the 10th century, and is dedicated to Harshat Mata, goddess of joy and happiness. Water plays a special part in Hindu cosmology, as a boundary between heaven and earth known as tirtha. As manmade tirtha, the stepwells became not only sources of drinking water, but cool sanctuaries for bathing, prayer, and meditation. The wells are called by many names. In Hindi they are baori, baoli, baudi, bawdi, or bavadi. In Gujarati, spoken in Gujarat, they are commonly called vav. The architecture of the wells varies by type and by location, and when they were built. Two common types are a step pond, with a large open top and graduated sides meeting at a relatively shallow depth. The stepwell type usually incorporates a narrow shaft, protected from direct sunlight by a full or partial roof, ending in a deeper, rounded well-end. Temples and resting areas with beautiful carvings are built into many of the wells. In their prime, many of them were painted in bright colors of lime-based paint, and now traces of ancient colors cling to dark corners. The use and conditions of stepwells began to decline in the years of the British Raj, who were horrified by the unsanitary conditions of these drinking water bathing spots. They began to install pumps and pipes, and eventually outlawed the use of stepwells in some places. The remaining stepwells are in varying states of preservation, and some have gone dry. Local kids seem to find the ones with water to be terrific diving spots, which seems insanely hazardous."
59,Hawa Mahal (Palace of Winds),"Jaipur, India",The 953 windows undoubtedly make this the world's most beautiful screened porch.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hawa-mahal-palace-of-winds,"The 953 windows covering the lace-like facade of the Palace of the Winds were designed to allow the ladies of the royal court to watch the drama of the streets unobserved behind their delicate latticework. Known as Hawa Mahal in Hindi, the Palace of the Winds was constructed in 1799 for Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh as part of the women’s section of the enormous City Palace at the center of Jaipur. The facade we see from the street is essentially an enormous screened porch, one room deep in most places. The palace’s distinctive rosy color comes from the natural sandstone from which it is built which also gives Jaipur its nickname, “The Pink City.” The Palace of the Winds is considered one of the finest examples of Rajput architecture in India."
60,The Root Bridges of Cherrapunji,"Cherrapunjee, India",Centuries-old bridges grown from tangled roots.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/root-bridges-cherrapungee,"In the depths of northeastern India, within sight of the India-Bangladesh border, in one of the wettest places on earth, bridges aren’t built—they’re grown. The southern Khasi and Jaintia hills are humid and warm, crisscrossed by swift-flowing rivers and mountain streams. On the slopes of these hills, a species of Indian rubber tree with an incredibly strong root system thrives and flourishes. The Ficus elastica produces a series of secondary roots from higher up its trunk and can comfortably perch atop huge boulders along the riverbanks, or even in the middle of the rivers themselves. The War-Khasis and War-Jaintias, two closely related tribes in Meghalaya, long ago noticed this tree and saw in its powerful roots an opportunity to easily cross the area’s many rivers. Now, whenever and wherever the need arises, they simply grow their bridges. In order to make a rubber tree’s roots grow in the right direction—say, over a river—the people of southern Meghalaya have used several different strategies. Sometimes, the roots of the trees are simply pulled, tied, twisted, and encouraged by hand to merge with each other, until, over time, they form the desired architectural structure. Root bridges have also been made by creating scaffolds out of wood and bamboo, and then training the young roots out across these temporary structures, replacing the more perishable elements many times as they rot in the intense monsoon seasons. In some places, such as around the village of Nongriat, betel nut trunks, sliced down the middle and hollowed out, are used to create root-guidance systems. The thin, tender roots of the rubber tree, prevented from fanning out by the betel nut trunks, grow straight out. The trunks also have the added advantage of providing the roots with additional nutrients as they decay. When they reach the other side of the river, they’re allowed to take root in the soil. Given enough time a sturdy, living bridge is produced. The root bridges can grow for as long as the organism they are a part of remains healthy, though they can take many years to initially become functional, the length of time being dependent on local conditions such as the health of the tree, the way the bridge is being grown, and the availability of nutrients in the soil that its being grown in. However, once root bridges become established, they’re extraordinarily strong—strong enough that some of them can support the weight of 50 or more people at a time. In fact, because they are alive and still growing, the bridges actually gain strength over time—and some of the ancient root bridges used daily by the people of the villages around Cherrapunji may be well over 500 years old. The roots bridges of southern Meghalaya come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes. They have been known to grow as long as 170 feet, and soar 80 feet above the streams they cross. Most living root bridges only have a single span, yet several have more than one, arranged as either as two parallel spans,  or as two bridges stacked one over the other, such as the famous “Umshiang Double-Decker Root Bridge.” The practice of creating new living bridges, and of preserving ones already in existence, is over large parts of Southern Meghalaya slowly fading out. In many villages across the region, the root bridges are little more than a memory.  However, since they began attracting attention again in around 2004, local dedication to the bridges has, at least in a few places, kept them from being destroyed in favor of steel ones. What’s more, a few new root bridges are currently under construction. In the village of Rangthylliang, an entirely new bridge is being grown using a bamboo and wood scaffold, and at the double-decker site in Nongriat, a new, third span is currently being grown above the other two, and should be ready for use within a decade. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the Root Bridges of Cherrapunji.  While there are dozens of root bridges, which can be found all throughout the valleys between (very roughly!) the towns of Mawsynram and Dawki, few of these are easily accessible, or have nearby tourist facilities. To visit the bridges in the more remote areas, a local guide is an absolute must! A number of these bridges can be reached from Cherrapunjee Holiday Resort. Local maps to the bridges are available from the Resort. The ""Umshiang Double-Decker Root Bridge"" is located in the village of Nongriat. Visitors can walk here from the small village of Tyrna. The village is accessible from Cherrapunjee by shared or private taxi. From the village, 2500 steps must be traversed to reach Nongriat. The walk takes about 1.5 - 2 hours each way. Nongriat offers basic accommodation to visitors, so it's possible to stay overnight for a more relaxed experience. Serene Guest House is the best run establishment in Nongriat. From Nongriat, short hikes can lead you to several nearby root bridges, include several upstream from the village, a small, nice one, in the village of Mynteng, and several spectacular examples in the village of Nongthymmai. A large number of living root bridges are known to exist in the jungles around the town of Pynursla. To reach these, many of which are deep in the jungle and require several hours of tough hiking, make sure to find a reliable, local, guide. The Rangthylliang Eco-Tourism society comes highly recommended, and can arrange your stay while in the area. Another option for visiting root bridges is the beautiful, remote, village of Kongthong, which has several in the near vicinity. The Kongthong Travelers Nest is a great base to explore the area from, with several spectacular root bridges within a few hours walk. There's also the village of Shnongpdeng, in the West Jaintia Hills, near Dawki, which can be used as a great staging area to explore several villages with root bridges. Recommended are Kudeng Rim, Padu, and Burma. All of these villages have very little in the way of tourist facilities, so make sure to ask for help planning your visit in Shnongpdeng! Please respect the area's natural surroundings."
61,Skeletons of Roopkund Lake,"Chamoli, India",A lake with hundreds of ancient skeletons surrounding it. The surprise is what killed them.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skeleton-lake-of-roopkund-india,"In 1942 a British forest guard in Roopkund, India made an alarming discovery. Some 16,000 feet above sea level, at the bottom of a small valley, was a frozen lake absolutely full of skeletons. That summer, the ice melting revealed even more skeletal remains, floating in the water and lying haphazardly around the lake’s edges. Something horrible had happened here. The immediate assumption (it being war time) was that these were the remains of Japanese soldiers who had died of exposure while sneaking through India. The British government, terrified of a Japanese land invasion, sent a team of investigators to determine if this was true. However upon examination they realized these bones were not from Japanese soldiers—they weren’t fresh enough. It was evident that the bones were quite old indeed. Flesh, hair, and the bones themselves had been preserved by the dry, cold air, but no one could properly determine exactly when they were from. More than that, they had no idea what had killed over 200 people in this small valley. Many theories were put forth including an epidemic, landslide, and ritual suicide. For decades, no one was able to shed light on the mystery of Skeleton Lake. However, a 2004 expedition to the site seems to have finally revealed the mystery of what caused those people’s deaths. The answer was stranger than anyone had guessed. As it turns out, all the bodies date to around 850 AD. DNA evidence indicates that there were two distinct groups of people, one a family or tribe of closely related individuals, and a second smaller, shorter group of locals, likely hired as porters and guides. Rings, spears, leather shoes, and bamboo staves were found, leading experts to believe that the group was comprised of pilgrims heading through the valley with the help of the locals. All the bodies had died in a similar way, from blows to the head. However, the short deep cracks in the skulls appeared to be the result not of weapons, but rather of something rounded. The bodies also only had wounds on their heads, and shoulders as if the blows had all come from directly above. What had killed them all, porter and pilgrim alike? Among Himalayan women there is an ancient and traditional folk song. The lyrics describe a goddess so enraged at outsiders who defiled her mountain sanctuary that she rained death upon them by flinging hailstones “hard as iron.” After much research and consideration, the 2004 expedition came to the same conclusion. All 200 people died from a sudden and severe hailstorm. Trapped in the valley with nowhere to hide or seek shelter, the “hard as iron” cricket ball-sized [about 23 centimeter/9 inches circumference] hailstones came by the thousands, resulting in the travelers’ bizarre sudden death. The remains lay in the lake for 1,200 years until their discovery.  There are no roads to this place yet, so one has to undertake a 3-4 day trek to reach the skeleton lake starting from Gwaldum in Chamoli district. The skeleton lake is covered with ice for most of the time during the year."
62,Jal Mahal,"Jaipur, India",More than half of this Indian palace is drowned but it looks all the more spectacular for it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jal-mahal,"Located in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake, a man-made reservoir created in 1596, the Jal Mahal (or “Water Palace”) only appears to be one story high, although there are four more levels to the building hidden beneath the water. Although the name translates to “Water Palace,” the building was never intended to be a palace, as such, but was instead conceived as a hunting lodge for the local Raja (King). In the 16th-century, a severe drought spurred the locals to create a dam, creating the lake that submerged the lower portions of the lodge. During the 18th century, the water-locked lodge was renovated and the lake area was expanded. For a great deal of the temple’s history, visitors were able to take gondolas across the lake waters to visit the historic faux-palace. The rooftop of the structure manages to support foliage and from the shoreline it almost looks like the castle is still in use. Today the building is inaccessible to tourists, although plans are afoot to convert it into a restaurant. Visitors wishing to see the building will have to suffice with the view from land which is even more spectacular in the evenings when the ancient Water Palace is illuminated as though there is some secret soirée occurring just out of reach."
63,Ellora Caves,"Verul, India","This complex of vertically-excavated Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu monolithic temples in India's Maharashtra providence illustrates a spirit of tolerance characteristic of ancient India.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ellora-caves,"Religious devotion was not uncommon in ancient times, but tolerance was often much harder to come by. Happily, for curious travelers and religious devotees alike, the caves at Ellora offer a truly exceptional example of both. Covering an area more than 2 kilometers in size, the Ellora Caves are a massive and humbling tribute to faith and medieval-era workmanship in India. In fact, the term “caves” hardly does justice to the 34 Buddhist, Brahmanist and Jainist temples in Ellora, each painstakingly carved out of the mountainside and filled with delicate works of art. Sculpted Buddhas and other religious figures abound, along with intricately carved images in the walls and decorative fixtures on the temples, usually seen in traditionally masoned buildings, but hardly common for something excavated out of solid rock - particularly using the tools and workforce available in the 5th through 10th centuries, when these temples were created. It’s truly hard to believe that the temples are, in fact, vertically excavated out of stone. Many of them put much easier-to-construct buildings to shame with their elaborate design, demonstrating both the strength of religious conviction that went into their creation as well as the highly skilled craftsmen who participated. It is a feat that would be difficult to match even with modern techniques, and of course far less likely to be undertaken due to the cost and time it would take to create it. But the delicate excavation isn’t the only feature of the Ellora Caves that would be unlikely to find in the modern era. The caves feature art, temple and habitation space from three different religions, proving the level of tolerance and cooperation among the disparate religious groups in India at the time of their creation. The three groups shared the space peacefully throughout the centuries, unafraid to worship near idols of a competing religion – something that would still be remarkable today, or in most other cultural eras for that matter. Indeed, the tolerance is likely not just a nice angle on the story of these temples – it’s likely exclusively due to the remarkable cooperation amongst religious beliefs that the caves became so elaborate and impressive, something any one group may not have been able to accomplish alone, and undoubtedly more grand than they otherwise would have been."
64,The Blue City of Jodhpur,"Jodhpur, India","Once an indicator of social class, the color blue has come to define this city on the edge of the Thar Desert.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-blue-city-of-jodhpur-jodhpur-india,"The second largest city in the Indian state of Rajasthan, this “Blue City” is a mesmerizing collection of azure abodes that soothes and delights anyone that beholds it. In the city of Jodhpur, a sea of boxy indigo houses stretches for more than 10 kilometers along the walls of the historic walled old city. A blue pigment coating on a house used to indicate that a Brahmin—the priests of the Indian caste system—dwelled there, but over time the color became a badge of identity for non-Brahmins, too. It’s also said to have insect-repelling abilities. Situated on the edge of the Thar Desert, Jodhpur is also called the “Sun City,” named for the overwhelming amount of bright and sunny days it experiences. It is home to famed forts, palaces, mausoleums, gardens, lakes, and towers, making it a hotspot for tourist activity. Since its founding more than 500 years ago, the city has earned renown for its textile industry, exquisite furniture shops, delectable cuisine, and bustling bazaars, among many other attractions. But above all, visitors aren’t likely to forget the eye-catching color coating the houses, creating a luscious blue sea in the arid Indian landscape. A view from the top of the looming Mehrangarh Fort, one of India’s largest forts from the 15th century, lets visitors overlook the bountiful, striking blue for which the city is known."
65,Shatrunjaya Hill,"Gheti, India",A mecca for India's Jains.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shatrunjaya-hill,"As typified by Muslims’ pilgrimages to Mecca or Jews’ to Jerusalem, most religions have epic places to where devotees can travel to better secure their places in heaven. The pilgrimage site for Jains, an Indian religious group, is particularly epic: a hugely complex series of more than 1,000 temples which pilgrims can reach only by climbing up nearly 4,000 steps. Jainism is a relatively small religion, with only a little over 4 million believers in India and small pockets of followers throughout the rest of the world. The Jains’ primary belief is non-violence; they believe that people, animals and even plants have souls and should be treated equally and well. Although they have no gods or spiritual figures, they do live with the principle of reincarnation in mind, hoping to eventually be liberated from the cycle of life and rebirth in an eternal transcedence. The Shatrunjaya Hill site is huge and pilgrimage rites are difficult for such an ascetic religion. The hill’s 3,950 steps often take three hours to climb, with the elderly often hiring a dholi, a seat attached to a pole carried by strong men, to the top. It is the goal of devout Jains to climb the mountain 99 times in their lifetimes. Once at the top, devotees are expected to pay homage at each of the complex’s many tuks, similar to temples. In worship, Jains sweep the grounds with brooms and remove their shoes so they don’t kill anything before sitting down. Then, white-robed pilgrims, monks and nuns chant sacred texts surrounded by Tirthankaras, similar to unclothed Buddha statues. In their building, the temples followed the Jainist principle of non-violence. None of the temples were built with ivory or clay because it contains micro-organisms and insects. Instead, all of the temples – the oldest of which dates back to the 11th century – are made of marble, bronze or stone. 215 kilomters from Ahmedabad and 51 kilometers from Bhavnagar"
66,The Great Wall of India,"Rajsamand, India",The second-longest continuous wall on the planet protects a hidden secret in the deserts of India.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-wall-india,"The wall that surrounds the ancient fort of Kumbhalgarh is one of the best-kept secrets in India, and perhaps the world. Protecting a massive fort that contains over 300 ancient temples, the wall was constructed half a millennium ago in tandem with Kumbhalgarh Fort itself. Often referred to as Kumbhalgarh Wall or simply as Kumbhalgarh Fort as a whole, the wall is perhaps best known by its most sensational—and fitting—name: The Great Wall of India. This is appropriate, as the wall extends over 36 kilometers (22 miles) around the perimeter of the fort, making it the second-longest continuous wall on the planet after the far more well-known Great Wall of China. Its anonymity is mystifying, since this is no crumbling line of bricks fascinating only by description. The wall is massive and breathtakingly majestic as it snakes through valleys and along mountaintops, again bearing a striking resemblance to its cousin in China. At its widest sections, the wall is 15 meters thick and beautifully masoned with thousands of stone bricks and decorative flourishes along the top, making this just as attractive as a tourist destination as it once was effective as a deterrent. This gaudy defense is fitting for the perimeter wall of Kumbhalgarh Fort, itself a hulking, imposing construction, with its many pregnant ramparts bowing out into the desert in boulder-like configurations, stacked atop one another and giving the fort the appearance of a mountain. Kumbhalgarh Fort, together with five other forts in the area, is registered as designated UNESCO World Heritage Site—Hill Forts of Rajasthan. Visitors should beware that this piece of history, while alluring and well-preserved, is not well-trafficked. That remoteness and the potential to have miles of ruins all to oneself is appealing to plenty of off-the-beaten-path travelers, but the walls are tall, the stone hard, and while many of the traps and defensive mechanisms along the wall and fort have been deactivated, that does not mean accidents cannot happen. The most pleasant weather conditions in the area are from October through March. Kumbhalgarh is a good option for a day trip from Udaipur. You can hire a car and driver from the local travel agencies in Udaipur for about 2,800-3,600 rupees for a full day. There are also hourly buses from Udaipur to Kelwara village near the Fort. Bus journey takes about three hours and costs some 50 rupees."
67,Mahabat Maqbara,"Junagadh, India",This otherworldly palace-mausoleum complex is the stuff eternal dreams are made of.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mahabat-maqbara,"Along a busy road in the heart of Junagadh city lies one of India’s least-known, yet most jaw-dropping architectural oddities. A smashing blend of Gothic and Islamic ornamentation, the Mahabat Maqbara complex remains one of India’s best kept secrets. This striking structure rising from out of nowhere is the mausoleum of Wazir Bahaduddinbhai Hasainbhai, one of the chief nobles in the Court of Nawab Mahabat Khan II of Junagadh. Construction on the yellow-walled complex began in 1878 by Mahabat Khanji and was completed in 1892 by his successor, Bahadur Khanji. Over a decade’s worth of work culminated in elaborate carvings on the buildings’ inner and outer façades, fine arches, French-style windows, columns and shining silver doorways. On the adjacent mosque, each minaret is encircled from top to bottom with winding staircases. Both buildings topped with distinctive “onion dome” rooflines. The monument’s seemingly perplexing mixture of Indo-Islamic, European, and Gothic architecture makes a bit more sense when considered in the larger context of the complex history of the district of Junagadh itself. Founded in 1748, Junagadh had officially become a British Protectorate in 1807 though was handed over to the East India Company’s control in 1818. For the rest of Great Britain’s colonial rule of India, the Saurashtra region escaped direct administration of British India. Instead, the British divided the territory into more than 100 princely states – including Junagadh – which remained in existence until 1947. The city’s present old town, built during the 19th and 20th centuries, existed in a sort of gubernatorial no man’s land. It is in this very spot that the Mahabat Maqbara complex was built, during the period of Britain’s occupation of India. At the time of India’s independence from British rule in 1947, incumbent ruler Mahabat Khan III elected to join Pakistan despite Junagadh having no common boundary with the new country. Under pressure from the Indian government he fled to Pakistan, and Junagadh reunited with India just three short months after declaring its independence. Despite the nonstop political tumult at its doorstep, Mahabat Maqbara has stood like a beacon as it quietly assumed the diversity of influences surrounding it. For interested visitors, access to the grounds is free, and the entirety of the mosque is open to all. Wazir Bahaduddinbhai Hasainbhai’s mausoleum, however, is explorable from the outside only, though it is said that keys to the interior can be procured from a keeper from the mosque. Just off MG Road, 5 minutes from the Junagadh Railway Station"
68,Hampi,"Hampi, India","The remains of what was, not so long ago, the world's largest city.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hampi,"On the boulder-strewn banks of the Tungabhadra River in Karnataka lie the ruins of Hampi, where the capital of the Vijayanagara Kingdom once stood. From 1336 to its fall in 1565, when it was sacked by Muslim invaders from the North, this was the Hindu capital of Vijayanagara Empire in Southern India. At that time, archaeologists estimate the city held about 250,000 people, which would have made it the largest city in the world. The site at Hampi is home to countless architectural wonders. As in other ancient, abandoned cities—like Palmyra or Teotihuacan—it is possible to stroll down the overgrown paths from building to building and imagine the splendid metropolis that Hampi once was. But in these famous ruins, one must also remember that it was not even 500 years ago (quite recent, archaeologically speaking) that this metropolis was bigger than that of Rome, Baghdad or Istanbul. The Vijayanagar style of architecture combined the Islamic style popular in Northern India with more Eastern elements, creating a new, unique mode that archaeologists call Indo-Saracenic architecture. The result: buildings that feature the stunning geometrical patterns and important structural advances made popular by Islamic builders, but also contain beautiful carvings and sculptures of Hindu gods and other important mythical figures. Besides the magnificent Virupaksha Temple—composed of successively smaller stories so that from below, the building seems to stretch unfathomably high—there are several fascinating structures not to miss, including the Lotus Mahal, the geometrically intricate Stepped Tank, and the iconic stone chariot (pulled by little stone elephants). Be sure to take in the banks of the rushing river, with its incredibly large and precariously positioned boulders. Hampi was made a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1986.  Fly to Hubli and drive 3 hours west or take the overnight train from Bangalore. Carry scarves to cover your face. it is quite dusty. And mosquito repellants. You will have to walk a lot, so carry walking shoes.   There is a Bus service to the Vitthala temple (Stone Chariot) which is a little far away from the main temple. You can rent bikes, but bikes are not allowed within the ancient city limits and near monuments.  Not everybody understands or speaks English or Hindi. They speak a regional dialect of Kannada. So your top priority would be to find someone who speaks the language you understand and keep a map with you at all times so you don't miss out and can navigate back to your hotel. Hampi Village (this is where the rice fields and boulders are) and Hampi City (this is where the ancient ruins are) are separated by the Tungabhadra river. Boat services to and fro run for a limited period during the day. The river can get fierce during rains, so it is advisable to stay on the city side. And it takes almost 2 hours (75 kilometres) by road, connecting the village to the city. But it is quite a picturesque ride."
69,Nek Chand Saini's Rock Garden,"Chandigarh, India",A palatial sculpture park was built illegally and in secret by a self-taught artist over 36 years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nek-chand-saini,"In 1957, Nek Chand, a lower-level government inspector, began collecting rocks behind a government building in Chandigarh, northern India. His innocent hobby began to expand, and during the 1960s, Chand began assembling the rocks, along with pieces of trash he had collected into an exhibition. Construction scraps from Le Corbusier’s vision for Chandigarh, along with broken household items began to take shape as sculptures, and the Nek Chand Saini was born. Although his work was illegal and would have been shut down had it been discovered, in 1976 Chand showed the garden to his superiors and was subsequently given permission and a labor force to further his artistic pursuits. From that time, Chand gave up government work and focused on the garden. Chand and a team of 50 men began heavy work in the mid-1970s and gave the garden a new life force. Sculptures of groups of people, all comprised of recycled materials, took shape around the garden. In many ways, the Rock Garden looks more like a fully functioning village than an art exhibition or statuary. Hundreds of statues dance across the mosaic tiles of the garden, inviting visitors to join in the merriment of Chand’s work. Visitors are even able to join in the community, by using the swing that is suspended beneath the great arches within the garden. Wild gangs of elephants, monkeys, and other animal sculptures also populate the garden, speckling the interior with life. In a country known more for the slums that grow out of its waste, the recycled outsider art of the Rock Garden is an internal triumph and an external spectacle. The garden now spans over 30 acres connected throughout by carefully designed walled passages and trails. Along with the jubilant sculptures, a series of waterfalls designed by Chand, provides a lush atmosphere, giving the entire garden the feeling of a living, breathing jungle community. One of the largest waterfalls descends from a pavilion in the garden, where visitors can walk directly up to the splashing rock wall. Chand’s garden is especially unique in this sense, as the whole area has been created for a whole-body experience of walking, touching, and enjoying the beautiful community that began as a small rock collection. The garden is a living and colorful tribute to art and ingenuity and a wholly Indian exhibition. It is detailed down to the mosaic tiling that visitors walk across in the garden. From the time of its creation, the garden has received worldwide acclaim and can easily be visited from Chandigarh.  Train from New Delhi to Chandigarh, The Shatabdi Express, runs two or three times daily from New Delhi to Chandigarh. The journey lasts approximately three hours. The Rock Garden is situated in the north of Chandigarh, Sector 1, and is known by everyone in the city."
70,Hanuman’s Temple,"Jaipur, India",Sacred Indian temple that’s all monkey business.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/temple-of-galtaji-at-galwar-bagh-hanuman-s-temple,"The pink stone Temple of Galtaji at Galwar Bagh is an idyllic sanctuary in the heart of Jaipur. Here, Hindu pilgrims gather to bathe in the sacred springs and reservoirs of the massive complex, which is situated on a hill, high above the flatlands of Rajasthan. A total of seven pools of natural spring water are within the area of Galtaji. The most sacred is Galta Kund, a reservoir that never goes dry. Alongside the lush natural springs are a number of other temples dedicated to various deities and spirits. A temple dedicated to the Hindu monkey god Hanuman is one of the most famous on the site because a tribe of his present day monkey relatives resides there. Along with living in the Galtaji temple, the monkeys also dangle from the intricate temple facades and cause chaos for visitors and pilgrims. They are well known in Jaipur and especially in Galtaji for their mischievous ways. Ironically, the monkeys’ famously naughty behavior is in stark contrast to their seemingly tranquil home. They even engage in fights, robberies, and general havoc right next to calm and sacred pools. Luckily for the monkeys, they are protected by their sacred status and connection to Hanuman. While it is unclear whether their behavior has made them a pest in the temple, it is obvious that it has brought them a small degree of fame. The dramatic antics of these so-called “Rebel Monkeys” achieved reality TV-worthy status, when the primates snagged their own show on National Geographic. Located 10 km outside of Jaipur."
71,Jantar Mantar,"Jaipur, India","The world's second-largest sundial, made entirely out of stone.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jantar-mantar,"In 1728, Sawai Jai Singh II, rajah of Jaipur, dispatched his emissaries across the globe to gather the most accurate astronomical data possible. When they returned, Jai Singh ordered the construction of the original Jantar Mantar complex in New Delhi, a monumental astronomical observatory constructed entirely out of stone and based on the astronomical tables of the French mathematician Phillipe de la Hire. In all Sawai Jai Singh built a total of five observatories, with the largest being this later construction of the Jantar Mantar in his hometown of Jaipur. Among the stone instruments Jai Singh constructed was the Samrat Yantra, a 73-foot-tall sundial. Though indistinguishable in design from other sundials of the day, it was far and away the most accurate. Its two-second interval markings are more precise than even de la Hire’s table. The smaller but older (and pink) version of the Jantar Mantar can be seen in New Delhi. In 2011, the 31-meter Reloj Solar Multicaja-Zaragoza was completed in Spain, and claimed the title of largest sundial in the world."
72,Ajanta Caves,"Ajanta, India",Rock-cut cave complex filled with ancient Buddhist artwork.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ajanta-caves,"Constructed over an 800 year period, the Ajanta Caves span a massive rock face in Maharashtra and are filled with ornate frescoes considered masterpieces of Buddhist art. Ajanta is split into two main series of caves, one built in 200 BCE and the other finished around 600 CE. Each cave opens up into grand halls, bedecked from floor to ceiling in detailed depiction of the Jataka stories, which tell of the Buddha’s past life. These caves are excavated in horse–shoe shaped bend of rock surface nearly 76 m in height overlooking a narrow stream known as Waghora. The location of this valley provided a calm and serene environment for the Buddhist monks who retreated at these secluded places during the rainy seasons. This retreat also provided them with enough time for furthering their religious pursuits through intellectual discourses for a considerably longer period. The caves were excavated in different periods (circa. 2nd century B.C. to 6th century A.D.) according to the necessity. Each cave was connected to the stream by a flight of steps, which are now almost obliterated, albeit traces of some could be noticed at some places. In all, total 30 excavations were hewn out of rock which also include an unfinished one. Out of these, five (cave no. 9, 10, 19, 26, and 29) are chaityagrihas and the rest are viharas. In date and style also, these caves can be divided into two broad groups. The earliest excavations belong to the Hinayana phase of Buddhism of which similar examples could also be seen at Bhaja, Kondane, Pitalkhora, Nasik, etc. In total, 5 caves at Ajanta belong to this phase, viz., 9 & 10 which are chaityagrihas and 8, 12, 13, & 15A which are viharas. These caves are datable to the pre-Christian era, the earliest among them being Cave 10 dating from the second century B.C. The object of worship is a stupa here and these caves exhibit the imitation of wooden construction to the extent that the rafters and beams are also sculpted even though they are non-functional. The addition of new excavations could be noticed again during the period of Vakatakas, the contemporaries of the Imperial Guptas. The caves were caused to be excavated by royal patronage and the feudatories under the Vakatakas as illustrated by the inscriptions found in the caves. Varahadeva, the minister of Vakataka king Harishena (A.D. 475-500) dedicated Cave 16 to the Buddhist Sangha while Cave 17 was the gift of a prince (who subjugated Asmaka) feudatory to the same king. The flurry of activities at Ajanta was between mid 5th century A.D. to mid 6th century A.D. However, Hieun Tsang, the famous Chinese traveller who visited India during the first half of 7th century A.D. has left a vivid and graphic description of the flourishing Buddhist establishment here even though he did not visit the caves. A solitary Rashtrakuta inscription in cave no. 26 indicates its use during 8th – 9th centuries A.D. The second phase departs from the earlier one with the introduction of new pattern in layout as well as the centrality of Buddha image, both in sculpture as well as in paintings The world famous paintings at Ajanta also fall into two broad phases. The earliest is noticed in the form of fragmentary specimens in cave nos. 9 & 10, which are datable to second century B.C. The headgear and other ornaments of the images in these paintings resemble the bas-relief sculpture of Sanchi and Bharhut. The second phase of paintings started around 5th – 6th centuries A.D. and continued for the next two centuries. The specimen of these exemplary paintings of Vakataka period could be noticed in cave nos. 1, 2, 16 and 17. The variation in style and execution in these paintings also are noticed, mainly due to different authors of them. A decline in the execution is also noticed in some paintings as indicated by some rigid, mechanical and lifeless figures of Buddha in some later period paintings. The main theme of the paintings is the depiction of various Jataka stories, different incidents associated with the life of Buddha, and the contemporary events and social life also. The ceiling decoration invariably consists of decorative patterns, geometrical as well as floral. The paintings were executed after elaborate preparation of the rock surface initially. The rock surface was left with chisel marks and grooves so that the layer applied over it can be held in an effective manner. The ground layer consists of a rough layer of ferruginous earth mixed with rock-grit or sand, vegetable fibres, paddy husk, grass and other fibrous material of organic origin on the rough surface of walls and ceilings. A second coat of mud and ferruginous earth mixed with fine rock-powder or sand and fine fibrous vegetable material was applied over the ground surface. Then the surface was finally finished with a thin coat of lime wash. Over this surface, outlines are drawn boldly, then the spaces are filled with requisite colours in different shades and tones to achieve the effect of rounded and plastic volumes. The colours and shades utilised also vary from red and yellow ochre, terra verte, to lime, kaolin, gypsum, lamp black and lapis lazuli. The chief binding material used here was glue. The paintings at Ajanta are not frescoes as they are painted with the aid of a binding agent, whereas in fresco the paintings are executed while the lime wash is still wet which, thereby acts as an intrinsic binding agent."
73,Great Banyan Tree,"Howrah, India","A single tree's 2,800 aerial roots give the appearance of a complete forest.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-banyan-tree,"The Great Banyan Tree is over 250 years old and covers about 14,500 square meters of land (3.5 acres) in the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Botanical Garden near Kolkata (Calcutta), making it the widest tree in the world. Banyan is the tree native to India and is botanically it is known as Ficus benghalensis. From a distance, the tree has the appearance of a forest, but what appear to be individual trees are actually aerial roots- around 3,600 of them. After two cyclones in the 19th century that led to a fungal attack, the tree’s main 15.7-meter-wide (51-foot) trunk had to be removed. Fortunately, the “clonal colony” of the tree itself remains healthy. A 330-meter-long road was constructed around the tree so that visitors could drive around the circumference, but the Great Banyan continues to spread beyond, growing wider with each passing year. Currently, it is already over 450-meters. There are other large banyan trees across India, including the Old Banyan in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh, the Gigantic Banyan Tree in Ranthambore National Park, and the Big Banyan in Bangalore."
74,Tanah Lot,"Kediri, Indonesia",Isolated atop this Balinese sea crag is a lovely Hindu temple that is said to be guarded by sea snakes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tanah-lot,"Just one of seven ocean temples on the coast of Bali that create a sort of spiritual bulwark against bad vibes rolling on the ocean currents, the ancient shrine atop Tanah Lot is said to be protected from demons by snakes both small and monster-sized. The true origins of Pura Tanah Lot (the temple that sits atop Tanah Lot) are lost to the sea spray of time, but according to legend it was created in the 16th century at the behest of a now-mythologized holy man. Along with the other six sea temples along the Bali shore, each within eyeshot of the next, it is meant to pay respect to the guardian spirits of the sea. The constant pounding of the currents against the base of Tanah Lot have created a number of sea caves at the foot of the rock formation, many of which are home to sea snakes. These snakes are rumored to protect the temple from evil spirits along with a giant nightmare snake that lurks in the waters around the temple. At low tide, Tanah Lot can be approached on foot.  The outer sanctum of the temple is open to visitors (holy men receive and bless you), but the inner sanctum of the temple itself is forbidden to any non-Balinese visitors. The small caves exposed by the receding water can be explored, for those who are not concerned by snakes (real or otherwise).  There is a cave within a cave on the beach where visitors may approach and receive a blessing from the sacred snake. Despite not being able to explore much of the rock’s surface, it cuts a stunning figure against the backdrop of the ocean horizon and the site has accordingly sprouted an unctuous tourist market full of stalls selling cheap merchandise to gullible sightseers. Maybe one day the temple’s guardian snake will rise up and protect the temple’s sanctity from those that would capitalize on its beauty.  Most tourists hire a car and driver for the day to visit Tanah Lot, along with the other popular temples as they are far apart from each other. The road to Tanah Lot temple can be dangerous, hence this is advisable. Alternatively, you can pay for a taxi and ask them to wait for you while you visit the place. If you have the time, the paddy fields along the way to this temple are worth a slow ride to enjoy the view. You may also want to detour to the rugged beach of Pantai Seseh nearby."
75,Ghost Palace Hotel,"Baturiti, Indonesia","An abandoned hotel in the highlands of Bali is shrouded in stories of ghosts, curses, and corruption.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ghost-palace-hotel,"Near the road from hard-partying Kuta to picturesque Lake Beratan, a massive luxury resort stretches languorously down a mountain ridge—not a particularly notable sight, but for the fact that this hotel sits dark and empty. Built in the 1990s and seemingly abandoned on the eve of its opening, the pristine modernity of this derelict building adds significantly to that giddy, something-bad-happened-here feeling that tantalizes ghost hunters and urban explorers alike. The Ghost Palace Hotel—more formally known as the PI Bedugul Taman Rekreasi Hotel and Resort—lies overgrown with creepers, weeds, and legends. One story suggests that the real estate developer behind the project became cursed due to his corrupt business practices and subsequently went bankrupt. Another tells of a fully operational hotel filled with workers and guests, all of whom suddenly disappeared in one night, leaving specters and demons to stalk the hotel’s empty corridors. Other ghostly accounts chalk up the supernatural presence to the spirits of laborers worked to death in the construction of the hotel. Bizarrely, the actual history of the Ghost Palace Hotel is somewhat difficult to verify, but the most likely scenario is that it was built starting in the early 1990s as an investment project of Tommy Suharto, the youngest son of former Indonesian President Suharto. Tommy went to prison in 2002, after being convicted of ordering the assassination of a judge on Indonesia’s Supreme Court who had previously found him guilty of corruption charges. Subsequently, construction of the hotel ground to a halt and has never restarted. Now abandoned for over a decade, the building still bears the furnishings and fixtures of a hotel preparing to receive its first guests. A video from a recent visit to the Ghost Palace Hotel can be seen here. The Ghost Palace Hotel, or PI Bedugul Taman Rekreasi Hotel & Resort, is located on the mountains in the central highlands of Bedugal, 50km north of Kuta. This hotel is not open for public. The main entrance is guarded, but the site can be entered at its highest point, at the back end, by hopping over the fence. According to the previous visitors, entrance through the main gates is watched by 'security officers' and cleaners; at some point they began to take payment of about 10,000 IDR to enter the hotel."
76,Sacred Monkey Forest (Mandala Wisata Wenara Wana),"Ubud, Indonesia",Hindu temple of the dead home to hundreds of long-tailed macaques.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sacred-monkey-forest,"In the center of Bali a centuries-old temple complex doubles as an ecological sanctuary for a thriving population of roughly 500 monkeys. The Balinese long-tailed macaques that call the Monkey Forest home are free to come and go as they choose - there are no cages, and no walls to hold them in, so visitors to the Monkey Forest have the unusual opportunity to watch monkeys close up, with no bars between them. Elsewhere in Bali macaques are often seen as pests, liable to steal valuable crops, but in the Monkey Forest they are revered and cared for as part of the spiritual life of the temples, and as manifestations of the Hindu monkey gods. The monkeys are fed and cared for by a staff of locals, who are also there to keep a watchful eye on tourists. The forest itself is comprised of 27 acres of deeply forested land, winding paths, sacred sculptures, and three distinct temples. Over 80 different species of trees have been identified within the forest, which also offer sanctuary to a host of birds, lizards, squirrel and deer, in addition to the star monkeys. The Monkey Forest is also home to a Pura Dalem, or Bali temple of the dead. It acts as counterpoint to the Pura Puseh (temples of origin) and Pura Desa (village temple) and contains a cemetery and Pura Prajapati (cremation temple) dedicated to Dewa Siwa, who judges the karma of the dead. Headstones are easily visible in a clearing visible between the trees near the cremation temple, where the recently dead are buried while their families and loved ones save up for the lavish cremation festivities unique to Balinese culture. At the appointed time families will disinter the dead and relocate them to an elaborate cremation pyre, after which the ashes are distributed to family shrines. It is thought that the earliest temple structures date back to around the mid 13th century, but they have been revised and rebuilt so many times over the years, up to an including the present day, that the edges of ancient and recent are thoroughly blended. The most sacred space in the Monkey Forest is the Lingga Yoni, a Hindu representation of phallus and womb, that has occupied the inner sanctum of the temple for hundreds of years. The third sacred space is a bathing temple, located along the stream that runs through the forest. In recent years researchers from around the world have taken advantage of the opportunity to observe the monkeys in several studies. Local vendors selling bananas and other treats to feed to the monkeys are usually positioned near the entrances, but visitors should bear in mind that the monkeys are wild animals that may bite and also may possibly carry disease. The official position of the Monkey Forest seems to be that no one will stop you from feeding the monkeys, but if you get bit it’s your own damned fault. Their website gently suggests that you might prefer to watch the staff feed the monkeys instead.  Entry: 40000 IDR (about $3) for adults, 30000 IDR (about $2.25) for students. Opening Hours: Monday-Sunday from 8 AM to 6 PM. Parking is free."
77,Pura Lempuyang Luhur,"Abang, Indonesia","Bali's remote ""gateway to heaven"" is one of the most sacred places on the island.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pura-lempuyang,"Pura Lempuyang Luhur is a complex of temples that speckles a trail leading to the top of Mount Lempuyang, a holy mountain. A total of seven temples dot the mountain’s slopes. At the lowest temple, a fantastic “gateway to heaven” greets visitors. Looking through the gate on a clear day reveals Mount Agung framed within its sides. Beyond the gate, three beautiful nāga-lined staircases lead up to the lowest temple. Pura Lempuyang Luhur is one of the oldest and holiest sites on the island and is thought to predate most Hindu temples there. The whole complex has been dubbed one of the “six sanctuaries of the world,” considered the most sacred places of worship on Bali. Yet, because of its remote location tucked away on the island’s eastern end, the complex saw few foreign visitors until recent years. Adventurous (and reasonably fit) travelers may hike up to the top temple, which is a four hour round-trip in total. Along the way, visitors will pass six other temples and can see beautiful vistas before finally arriving at Pura Lempuyang Luhur. Locals believe one must never complain on the way up. If one complains, they will not make it to the top. Pura Lempuyang Luhur, the highest temple, is the crown jewel of the complex (and also its namesake). It sits atop the mountain’s peak, which is believed to be its most sacred spot. Those who make it to the top are rewarded with a peaceful sanctuary and breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains.  Pura Lempuyang is not easily accessible, and parking is limited. The best way to get there is to hire a car and driver. If coming from Ubud or the beach towns on the south coast, budget one full day for this excursion, and consider pairing it with a visit to the nearby Tirta Gangga water gardens. Be respectful at all times. Wear a sarong while visiting this temple complex, and make sure bare knees and shoulders are not visible. This applies to both men and women. If observing a ceremony, take photographs from a respectful distance using your zoom lens. There's no fee to get into the temple, but donations are requested."
78,Gereja Ayam,"Magelang, Indonesia",This massive chapel in the middle of the Indonesian forest is both haunting and fowl.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gereja-ayam,"Should you be trekking through the thick forests of Magelang, Indonesia, try not to be too alarmed if you stumble upon a titanic building shaped like a chicken. Known as Gereja Ayam (unsurprisingly, “Chicken Church”), this moldering, behemoth, bird-like building is an unexpected, whimsical sight to stumble upon. While the locals have dubbed it the Chicken Church (and it’s easy to see why), the name is a bit of a misnomer since the visionary behind the crumbling chapel meant it to look like a dove. The man behind the weird structure was Daniel Alamsjah, who received a holy vision that inspired him to create the dove church. He picked a forested hill near Magelang to build his pious tribute, and created possibly the most bird-like building in the world, complete with giant, squawking head, and ornate decorative tail feathers. The prayer house opened its doors (or spread its wings, so to speak) by the 1990s. The fledgling church welcomed any religions that wanted to make the trek, including Buddhists, Muslims, and Christians, holding services in the upper floors, while the lower floors provided rehab and juvenile outreach, among other charitable services. Unfortunately, the project was grounded in 2000 when further construction costs became too high. The poor chicken-dove-church was vacated, and left to the forest. Gereja Ayam continued to rot over the years, becoming a bit more ghoulish (in an avian way), with each year. But these days, it’s been cleaned up and turned into a proper tourist attraction. Local artists have covered the inner walls with vibrant murals showing local mythology and history and there’s a small cafe nestled within the chicken’s rear that sells traditional, tasty treats. You can even climb up to the top of the bird’s head for amazing 360-degree views. The Chicken Church has gained some media attention. In 2016 the documentary film, Into the Inferno, has a section devoted to the temple highlighting the connection to the nearby volcano. Church is open every day and is often part of the nearby Borobodur Temple tour; there is a small entry fee."
79,Taman Festival,"Denpasar Timur, Indonesia",A haunting theme park is slowly being swallowed by the jungle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taman-festival-bali,"Eerie and overrun with lush greenery, this abandoned theme park in Bali is an urban explorer’s dream. Colorful graffiti adorns the walls of its crumbling buildings. Most of the park has succumbed to nature’s mercy and is slowly being swallowed by the jungle. It isn’t known for certain as to why this grand theme park was deserted by the owners before it ever even opened. Some reports say the owners abandoned ship after fearing it would become unprofitable following the 2002 Bali terrorist attacks. Others say lightning struck its laser machines, which were meant to illuminate the night sky as part of the park’s star attraction. Never fated to fill its grounds with throngs of tourists, it has now become a home for graffiti artists and budding photographers. Wander among the pathways that meander through the eight-hectare site (beware of the broken glass), and you’ll find an olympic-sized swimming pool, a cinema, a wedding chapel, and many restaurants, all reclaimed by nature. It’s a haunting experience. Vines and weeds twist sinisterly around the decrepit structures, while miniature jungles overtake others. Bats, enormous spiders, and a host of other insects hide in the dark corners of the dust-coated buildings. Keep an eye out for the empty crocodile pit—its former residents were left to roam the park after it was abandoned and supposedly lurk just out of sight. Rumors abound that these reptilian residents have been know to snack on humans.  If arriving by bike, you need to pay 2500IDR to the landowner for parking. Locals may charge you something between 10000 and 20000 IDR per person to let you in."
80,Komodo National Park,"East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia",A sprawling nature preserve harbors the world's only living dragons.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/komodo-national-park,"Historically, dragons have been feared and hunted, but the Komodo National Park was created to protect the only known “dragon” in the world. The Komodo dragon is the largest lizard in the world and can grow up to 2-3 meters in length which would be scary enough if it weren’t for the monster’s poison bite. Despite the beast’s hideous visage and carnivorous reputation this Indonesian wildlife reserve was created to make sure that it does not go extinct. Komodo Island is the only place in the world where the huge lizards live and their relatively small population puts them at extreme risk.  Covering a number of small islands including the largest islands of Komodo, Padar, and Rinca, the national park keeps the delicate natural balance from disappearing. A number of other protected lizards, rats, and snakes also inhabit the islands along with a collection of large mammals that were introduced by man such as buffalo, deer, and monkeys. Unlike many wildlife parks, Komodo covers four human settlements as well, all of which existed when the park was designated. The people living in the park are mainly fishermen and tradesmen. Visitors are welcome to the islands. In order to keep tourists safe from the huge lizards, locals feed the Komodo dragons in the morning so that they are less inclined to look for visiting prey. The protection offered by the reserve has expanded over the years and now includes a marine biome which is preserved along with the other exotic flora and fauna in the Komodo National Park. Despite the increasingly diverse environments in the park, it is unlikely to be known for anything more than the dragons that stalk its shores.  You can arrange for group tours to the various islands of Komodo or even hire your own personal ride to visit Flores Islands. The Komodo National Park is open daily from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and there is even an adventure trek in Komodo Island that takes around 4-5h (4.9 miles). Visitors are advised to bring sunscreen, hat, sunglasses, hike shoes and plenty of water."
81,Goa Gajah,"Sukawati, Indonesia","The name of this ancient Indonesian temple translates as ""Elephant Cave"" but it could be more accurately called ""The Hellmouth.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/goa-gajah,"Not far outside of the city of Ubud in Bali is a fantastical archeological site known as Goa Gajah, or “Elephant Cave,” although visitors could be forgiven for finding this name confusing given the wild-eyed demon maw that serves as a front door. The ill-fitting monicker comes from a complicated trickle down of translations relating to the temple cave throughout history that may have alluded to elephants at one point. However there does not seem to be any actual pachyderm imagery anywhere on the site. Instead the facade of the cave is carved into a surprisingly menacing devil’s face with wide eyes staring over the doorway that acts as its screaming mouth. All around the monster’s face is what seems to be a roiling sea of flames. Flanking the frightening frieze are smaller sculptures of creatures that have eroded with time. Despite this terrifying entrance the cave is actually thought to have been a place of meditation and spiritual cleansing where religious offerings were left (and still are). While no one is positive of the original use of the space, it is speculated that the demon’s face on the outside was actually meant to scare away evil spirits, not attract them. A large communal bath was unearthed nearby in the 1950’s featuring tall statues of serene figures pouring water out of jars into the central bath. A far cry from the howling cave entrance. Today the ornately unsettling cave can be visited and all those daring to pass through the demon’s jaws can witness the cave’s secluded quietude. Just don’t think of elephants.  15,000 Rp"
82,Trunyan,"Trunyan, Indonesia",One native village in Bali lays their dead at the foot of a holy tree whose natural fragrance seems to hide the stench as the bodies decompose.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trunyan,"The walk up to the Trunyan cemetery in Bali is littered with skulls and human bones which have been set up on stones. This is a byproduct of the nearby villagers’ unique death ritual that sees the deceased placed above ground at the foot of a tree to simply decompose in the open air. One might think that such a laissez-faire practice would lead to not only an unstoppable vermin and carrion bird infestation, but also an unlivable stench. However, when the bodies are laid out, they are placed at the foot of a large banyan tree which the villagers consider holy, and which seemingly masks the scent of the corpses. This sacred funeral rite is performed when one of the village’s number dies of natural causes, at which time a white sheet is placed over the body and they are laid out. Others are laid out above ground and covered with bamboo teepees. The villagers who adhere to this practice belong to a group known as the Bali Aga, people who have descended from the original Balinese natives. Their unique “burial” traditions are believed to go back hundreds of years, yet there does not seem to be a case of the exposed corpses presenting a health or comfort issue. In fact, a number of tourists visit the site each year, to the point where it is now common to be approached repeatedly by villagers asking for donations, and even getting there requires exorbitant bribes for boat transportation. However, one thing nearly no one is complaining about is the smell.  Trunyan cemetery is most easily accessible by boat from Kedisan. The price of the boat ride (including the donation for the village) was 400, 000 IDR per person in May 2017. For comparison to rent a car for 10 hours with driver was 550, 000 IDR."
83,Padar Island,"Komodo, Indonesia","Once home to Komodo dragons, this island dreamscape has a rare combination of white, pink, and black sand beaches.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/padar-island,"The Indonesian island of Padar is about 20 miles (30 km) from Labuan Bajo, a fishing town on the westernmost part of Flores. Padar is small, but is the third largest island of Komodo National Park, and was once a stomping ground for the immense dragons that gave the reserve its name. Padar is mostly savannah-covered, surreal landscape fringed by bright green-capped mountains of fairy-tale shapes. It’s all surrounded by three turquoise bays, and curiously, each one of the bays’ beaches has different coloured sand: One is pearly white, another charcoal black, and a third is a very rare baby pink. It is a rare combination, a quirk of this unique island. The black-sanded beach has volcanic origin, composed of various dark minerals. The pink, one of a few in the world, has pulverized red coral mixed with white sand.  And the white one, in most any other setting would be a spectacular find. Here, it almost plays third fiddle. Padar is home to a remarkable array of wildlife, especially for its size. There are six species of shark, and two of manta rays, and many different reptiles. There once were three kinds of Komodo dragons here. (They are gone now, but still found on Komodo, Rinca, Gili Montang, Gili Dasami, and Flores.) There are dolphins, the occasional whale, falcons, kites, geckos, and green turtles. And then there are some plain old little mammals, to feed their neighbor predators. Visitors can do a 30 minute hike to Padar's summit to see a panoramic view of the island, go trekking for around an hour, snorkel or just hit the pristine tri-colored beaches. Labuan Bajo is the closest city, and there are tours departing daily for one, two, or three-day visits. The best time is from April to June, and from September to November. Bring sunscreen, sunglasses, good hiking shoes, a hat, plenty of water and get ready for some serious 30-foot exercise uphill."
84,Pura Ulun Danu Bratan,"Baturiti, Indonesia",This tiny lake temple dedicated to a water goddess seems to float on the surface.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pura-ulun-danu-bratan,"Bali’s Pura Ulun Danu Bratan temple pokes up out of the waters of Lake Bratan as though it is simply the peak of some much larger temple just beneath the water. While it is as starkly humble as it seems, its importance to the community would seem to back up that grander fantasy. Constructed in 1633, the temple is devoted to the goddess of the lake, Ida Batara Dewi Ulun Danu, in Balinese. The pair of relatively small pagodas that sit on the lake’s waters act as the mother shrines to a countless series of smaller shrines set up at various points downstream. The lake itself has been the main reservoir for a large portion of central Bali for ages and is thus not only functionally very important but also holy to many. In order to keep the waters clean and flowing, the temples on the lake are devoted to the goddess Dewi Danu whose demesne includes rivers, lakes, and other waters. There are also fertility idols at the site of the temples due to the area’s legendary potency and virility, which is also attributed to the waters of the lake. Visitors to the Pura Ulun Danu Bratan site will first pass through an ornate temple structure on land before being able to board a canoe directly to the pagodas, which seem to almost float right on the water. The little buildings actually sit on a pair of small lake islands; however, the visual effect is nonetheless impressive. The site is popular among those looking to take in Bali’s most beautiful temples, but the meditative quietude of the lake backdrop is likely enough to make up for the presence of any strangers.  One of the easy and convenient ways to get there yourself is to take one of the public transports to Lake Bratan from Denpasar or Lovina. Alternatively, you may take the shuttle buses running between the southern beaches and Lovina. From Lovina, it takes 45 minutes to get to the Pura Ulun Danu, while from Ubud, it is a 1.5 hours drive and from Kuta, a 2 hours drive. In case you decide to drive, there is also a spacious park and two restaurants."
85,Kelimutu Volcano,"Kelimutu, Indonesia",Three wildly colorful calderas top this otherworldly volcano chain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kelimutu-volcano,"Lakes, volcanoes, and colors are all on impressive display at the Kelimutu Volcano, an otherworldly series of geologic cauldrons that hold lakes of startling brilliance. 50 miles from the town of Moni on the Indonesian Island of Flores is Kelimutu Volcano and its three summit craters containing their three lakes. The westernmost of the lakes, Tiwu Ata Mbupu (Lake of Old People), is blue, while Tiwu Nuwa Muri Koo Fai (Lake of Young Men and Maidens) is green, and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched or Enchanged Lake) is red, the latter two separated only by a crater wall. Historically, the lakes have been the source of minor phreatic eruptions from the 1639 meter high Kelimutu volcano. In addition to being three different colors, the lakes’ color varies on a periodic basis, likely due to chemical reactions from the minerals in the lake triggered by volcanic gas activity, but no thorough studies have as yet been performed. That the three lakes are of the same volcano and are at the same crest, yet have different colors, is incredibly rare and of extreme interest to geologists. The Kelimutu Volcano is one of nature’s most stunning displays of color and chemistry and has attracted a number of photographers and tourists over the years. So long as it never erupts, this candy-colored mountain is just a gentle giant.  Moni is a four-hour drive from the Maumere airport or a three-hour drive from the Ende airport."
86,Luhur Uluwatu Temple,"Kuta Selatan, Indonesia",This Balinese sea temple is thought to be guarded by the hundreds of monkeys that live around it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/luhur-uluwatu-temple,"One of the sacred sea temples that are said to create a visually unbroken chain along the Bali coast, the Luhur Uluwatu Temple is a gorgeous, historic pagoda site that is said to be protected by the mischievous monkeys that live in the surrounding forest. A temple structure of some kind is said to have existed on the cliff where Luhur Uluwatu now resides, long before the current structure was developed. The structures, including a lovely cliffside pagoda and crumbling stone arches, are thought to have been built around the 11th century. The structure is built right up to the edge of a sea cliff that drops 230 feet down into the ocean. Walls along the cliffside prevent visitors stunned by the incredible view of the sunset from plummeting off the edge. Like Tanah Lot (which can be seen from the top of the cliff), another Balinese sea temple that is said to protect Bali from malevolent sea spirits, Luhur Uluwatu has protective animals. As the isolated Tanah Lot is overrun with sea snakes, Luhur Uluwatu is rotten with monkeys. Taking roost in the temple itself and the surrounding vegetation, the monkeys of Uluwatu are known to nab any loose possessions that visitors might have on display, often only trading them back for pieces of fruit. They have been known to rip shiny earrings out of visitors’ ears and run away with them, or steal food right out of visitors’ hands. These beasts are said to be the spiritual protectors of the temple, although their main weapon seems to be annoyance. Spirit monkeys or no, the Luhur Uluwatu Temple is a majestic link in a chain of beautiful sea temples. Just be sure to hold on to your belongings.  A taxi from Kuta to Uluwatu will take 30-40 minutes and cost about 150,000Rp one way. From Nusa Dua, it is a 45 minute drive. It is advisable to hire a car to visit this temple, since you may also visit other places in Bali along with it."
87,Millennium Bridge,"Abiansemal, Indonesia","One of the largest bamboo bridges in Asia, located right next to a bamboo school.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/millennium-bridge,"One of the largest bamboo bridges in Asia is part of an even larger effort in Sibang Kaja, Bali, to combine modern ideas about green living and traditional uses of bamboo. The Millennium Bridge extends 75 feet (23 meters) from one side of the Ayung River to the other. It is connected to the Green School, an ecologically sustainable complex that’s also made out of bamboo, as well as mud and local grasses. Nearby, there is a community of bamboo houses. These projects, created by the team at IBUKU, an organization dedicated to beautiful and natural building, demonstrate how bamboo can be used as a renewable alternative to concrete or steel, to which it has comparable strength, though is more susceptible to the elements. The bridge, which has a floor area of 230 square feet (70 square meters), took eight months to construct, and was completed in December of 2011. The roof of the covered bridge is inspired by the architecture of the Minangkabau people of Indonesia. In addition to being a means of crossing the Ayung River, the Millennium Bridge can also be rented as a scenic place for events. Up to 30 people can be accommodated on the bridge."
88,Jembatan Akar,"West Sumatra, Indonesia",This Sumatran root bridge took almost 30 years to knit itself together.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jembatan-akar,"Extending over the Indonesian Batang Bayang River, the slowly growing Jembatan Akar root bridge is made entirely out of the naturally growing roots of two banyan trees that have been slowly cultivated to knit into a walkable span. The span (Jembatan Akar means “root bridge”) was first conceived of in 1890 by a local teacher who wanted his students from a village across the river to have an easier time getting to his classes. To start the bridge, he put a bamboo frame in place and began wrapping the ever-growing aerial roots of the large banyan trees on either side of the water along the frame. Ever so slowly, the bridge began to take shape. The project took 26 years of carefully tended growth to become sturdy enough to support anyone. The 100-foot span has since been shored up and reinforced with wooden planks and metal cables as well as becoming stronger year after year as the massive roots of the still-living trees continue to grow. Guide lines have also been added to provide additional support for visitors. Unfortunately the original creator of the bridge is no longer alive to see what has grown from his simple idea, but thousands of visitors and commuters each year have him to thank for creating one of the most curious bridges in the world. The bridge is up in the mountains, south east of Padang. Drive south from Padang until Ps. Baharoe and head north towards Kotobarapak. If you follow the valley north towards Rawang you will be on the right lines. The coordinates are accurate."
89,Kampung Warna-Warni Jodipan (Village of Color),"Malang, Indonesia",This Indonesian village was revitalized by a vibrant rainbow paint job.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kampung-warnawarni-village-of-color,"South of the city center in Malang, Indonesia, rows upon rows of monotonous white houses with brown roofs suddenly transform into a rainbow of vibrant colors bursting at every corner. What was formerly an impoverished village called Kampung Jodipan was transformed into an oasis of color and art, a project that has delighted visitors and revitalized the local community. The village of Kampung Warna-Warni (Indonesian for “Village of Color”) was once drab and polluted, lacking the economic resources required to build a healthy community. But eight event management students from a nearby university lent a helping hand by applying their class skills to the real world. The students partnered with a local paint company looking to do a social responsibility project, which donated over 6,000 pounds of colorful paint, and voila, a hueless city got a brilliant new paint job. Inspired by the favelas of Rio, every square inch of the rainbow village is coated in color, ranging from pastels of green and orange to pink and yellow. The bridge nearby the village is also painted, its beams erupting in magnificent blues and purples. Although it may seem like the paint job would benefit visitors more than those actually living in the village, the makeover has revitalized the community. The beautiful colors improved the village’s standard of living by drawing in new tourist dollars, and the beauty of the colorful houses has inspired many community members to improve the sanitation of their river. Kampung Jodipan’s experiment was so successful with selfie takers, it inspired several other projects throughout Indonesia, including next door neighbor Kampung Tridi (famous for 3D murals) and Kampung Pelangi (Rainbow Village) in Randusari.  Kampung Jodipan is connected to Kampung Tridi by a colorful bridge. Admission fees for each village are separate."
90,Ghibli Museum,"Tokyo, Japan",A magical place that lets you play in and explore the world of Studio Ghibli.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ghibli-museum,"Situated in the suburbs of Mitaka, the Ghibli Museum is both a showcase for the famed animation studio and a playground for children of any age. Known in the west for its films such as Spirited Away, the museum’s design was informed by Hayao Miyazaki’s personal vision. He didn’t want it to become yet another boring pile of exhibits. Instead, he “put it together as if it were a film,” creating a series of rooms with motifs from every single piece of animation he had produced or found interesting, visitable in any order. The result is like stepping into the wizard’s cottage whilst he is away, with artist’s materials, animation cells, and sketchbooks preserved alongside overflowing ashtrays and cardboard boxes filled with reusable pencil stubs. The motifs begin when you step off the bright yellow bus - the bus stop is in the shape of the studio’s mascot, Totoro. One particular delight is the room that showcases different methods of animation, which draws your gaze from the zoetrope near the entrance, on past the moving wooden figures, pausing to see the stop-motion carousel spin up, then stopping dead at the Heath Robinson-like film projector in a glass case to view the “evolution of man” movie at different points in the projector. Another, sadly for under-12s only, is the playroom that holds a plush Catbus complete with chuckable Soot Sprites. The main attraction is the short film that can only be seen in the Museum in its tiny theatre. Rotated out every day, they are in Japanese (without subtitles), though it is often easy enough to follow regardless. You receive your ticket when you arrive, and may have to wait for 5-15 minutes to get seats. Photography is prohibited inside the building except in the rooftop garden, which is dominated by a huge bronze figure from Laputa: Castle in the Sky. There is also a cafe, gift shop, and bookshop inside, and a picnic park outside where families can sit under the cherry blossoms in March/April.  Access is strictly limited - only 200 admissions per day for overseas visitors. Tickets must be purchased in advance; there is no ticket office at the museum.  Tickets go on sale on the web in advance beginning on the 10th of the month beforehand, starting at 10 a.m. and sell out quickly, within days or hours. Tickets can also be purchased in Japan at Loppi kiosks at Lawson convenience stores. The best way to get to it is by train and bus. Train: Take the JR Chuo Main Line west from Shinjuku Station to Mitaka Station to catch the bus. Most large stations will have maps in both Japanese and English. (Do NOT go to Mita Station on the Yamanote Line, which is entirely different.) Bus: From Mitaka Station, go to the South Exit and move towards the bus stands nearby and slightly to your left. Buy the ticket to the museum from the attendant and wait for the museum bus, which is unmistakable - bright yellow and covered with cartoon characters. Alternatively, if you have a map to guide you, you can get off at Kichijoji Station (one stop before Mitaka Station) and walk 1.4 kilometers (just under a mile) through Inokashira Park to reach the museum at the far edge of the park."
91,Wisteria Tunnel,"Kitakyushu, Japan",An exquisite tunnel of cascading flowers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wisteria-tunnel,"It’s practically impossible to walk through the pastel-colored passageway of wisteria flowers at the Kawachi Fuji Gardens in Kitakyushu without imagining an elegant fairy princess and her one-horned white steed prancing alongside you. A member of the pea family, wisteria is an ornamental vine, wildly popular in both Eastern and Western gardens for its graceful hanging flowers and its ornate, winding branches. Easily trained, the woody vines tend to reach maturity within a few years, at which point they bloom in cascades of long, lavender flowers of varying pastel shades. There are about 150 flowering wisteria plants of roughly 20 species that create this famous colorful flower tunnel. Make sure to visit in late April or Early May, during the “Fuji Matsuri,” or “Wisteria Festival,” when the magical tunnel is in full bloom. Because many visitors come to the gardens during the blooming season, you need to book your time slot in advance. Arrive at any other time of year, and its appearance will be a disheartening mass of lifeless, twisted branches.  Take the Shinkansen to Kokura station. Change to the JR Kagoshima line for Yahata station. From Yahata station, take the Nishitetsu bus to Kawachi Syougakou mae (Kawachi Elementary School). Buses only run once an hour or so, and the stop is not close. A taxi might be a better, though expensive, option."
92,Sagano Bamboo Forest,"Kyoto, Japan",The sound of swaying stalks in this stunning grove has been named a governmentally recognized sound.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sagano-bamboo-forest,"Growing tall on the edges of Kyoto, the Sagano Bamboo Forest is a once tranquil nature spot that is now a series of tourist-packed pathways, but if you can escape the sounds of camera shutters and boorish visitors, you’ll hear the rustling, creaking, and swaying of one of Japan’s governmentally recognized soundscapes. The Sagano Bamboo Forest is situated northwest of Kyoto in Japan near the Tenryū-ji Temple in the Arashiyama district. The region experiences unpredictable weather with a rather cool climate and bright sunlight. In this region the summers are short, hot, and mostly cloudy. The winters are very cold, windy, and partly cloudy. It is also wet year-round Only 30 minutes or so from Kyoto city center, the towering bamboo forest is an almost shocking contrast to the urbanity surrounding it. Wooden paths weave through the dense thicket of tall bamboo stalks that reach dozens of feet into the sky, creating a canopy. As the wind passes through the tightly packed plants, the wood bends and creaks, the leaves rustle, and the trunks knock together, creating a peaceful sound like almost nothing else. That is, when the hordes of tourists aren’t drowning it out. The meditative natural noise is so lovely, in fact, that Japan’s Ministry of the Environment designated the location’s aural pleasures as one of the country’s “100 Soundscapes of Japan,” an initiative designed to encourage the local population to get out and appreciate the country’s acoustic wonders. If visitors can find a time to visit the bamboo forest when it is relatively empty the combination of visual beauty and auditory calm may be one of a kind. There is no word, however, on how the place smells."
93,Cat Island,"Ishinomaki, Japan","On Japan's Tashirojima Island, cats are king.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cat-island,"On the island of Tashirojima in the Miyagi Prefecture, the cats outnumber people, and the people like it that way. It’s no accident that the cats who inhabit Tashirojima—or what has become known as “Cat Island”—in Japan have come to be the island’s primary residents. Cats have long been thought by the locals to represent luck and good fortune, and doubly so if you feed and care for them. Thus, the cats are treated like kings, and although most are feral because keeping them as “pets” is generally considered inappropriate, they are well-fed and well-cared-for. Despite this, luck and fortune haven’t exactly come to the human residents of “Cat Island.” In the last 50 years, the human population of the island has dwindled from 1,000 to fewer than 100. As more and more people have shunned the island as it became dominated by felines, the people that have remained have become ever more protective of the cats. Currently, dogs are not allowed on the island to protect the well-being of the cats—and presumably any dog foolish enough to venture onto an island full of feral cats. There is even a small cat shrine (Neko-jinja 猫神社 in Japanese) in the middle of the island to commemorate an accidentally killed cat. The cats may end up bringing luck after all, however. Tourism has been picking up as the island has become an attraction for curious travelers, thanks to all of those cats.  It can be difficult to find cat food on the island, so if you opt to bring some treats, drop by a convenience store before taking the ferry. This is not the only cat island in Japan. Another popular spot is Aoshima island in Ehime Prefecture with about 150 cats and about a dozen human residents."
94,Jigokudani Monkey Park,"Yamanouchi, Japan",Hot springs monkey spa in the middle of Hell's Valley.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jigokudani-park-japan,"So named because of the area’s eerie bubbling hot springs, harsh landscape, and snowy frigid climate, Jigokudani translates to “Hell’s Valley”. Snow covers the ground more than four months out of every year and the valley is lined with jagged cliffs, jutting over 2,500 feet into the air. The park is most famous for its population of Japanese Macaques, also known as Snow Monkeys, the most northern living non-human primates. Sometime in the early ’60s these clever characters decided to test the waters of the natural hot springs, and they’ve descended from the forest to warm up in their steamy discovery every winter since. Some of the hot springs even reach temperatures above 122 degrees Fahrenheit, which is perfect for warming monkeys along with visitors to the region. Although not technically a religious site, the Snow Monkeys are popular in Japanese fables and are believed to be messengers of the Shinto mountain gods and rivers. Although the region is remote, there is no doubt that seeing monkeys on a spa retreat is probably a surreal and spiritual experience all on its own.  Jigokudani Monkey Park is located near Yamanouchi town. The closest large city is Nagano, which is about 40 to 45 minutes away. You can find an exact list of bus times to/from the snow monkey park at the Nagano train station. An express bus from Nagano is 1,400 yen to the park entrance. You can also take a local train from Nagano to Yudanaka Station and from there take a local bus or taxi to the park entrance. From the park entrance it is a 1.6 km walk to the park itself. Snow boots and jackets can be rented from the information center, as the ground can be slippery in the winter. Monkeys are fed during the morning, bath in the hot springs after, then head off into the night to sleep, so it's best to visit early to mid-day to get the view of both the feeding frenzy and the bathing. The park can be visited year round but winter is the best time to visit when everything is covered in snow."
95,Vampire Café,"Tokyo, Japan",A taste of the macabre Tokyo's ritzy shopping district.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vampire-cafe,"A far cry from the sunny, commercial milieu of Ginza, the Vampire Café begs customers to enter a Gothic paradise, aptly blending tourist kitsch with the decor of Dracula’s VIP room. Covered wall to wall with red velvet, and carefully decorated with a delicate touch of morbid flair, waiters take orders in snappy tuxedos and waitresses in French maid outfits glide across the red floor covered in red blood cells. From the decor to the dishes, every last detail is crafted to create a vast and eerie dining landscape. While sitting at red-covered thrones, diners can sip a dark red aperitif garnished with tiny skulls. The light from candles atop coffins flicker with a supernatural aura powerful enough to make Bram Stoker work up an appetite for more blood-soaked treats as baroque music drones through the dim restaurant. The atmosphere is enough to make patrons forget the lively world of flagship stores and luxury shopping just seven floors below them and sink in their teeth."
96,The Giant Ghibli Clock,"Tokyo, Japan",Tokyo’s only Vaudeville-cuckoo clock–steampunk-Victorian curio cabinet time piece.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-giant-ghibli-clock-tokyo-japan,"Officially called the “NI-Tele Really BIG Clock,” four or five times a day this wacked-out symphonic mega-machine spins, dances, whirs and clanks. And as a side gig, it also tells the time. The giant clock is in the Shiodome section of Tokyo, at the Nittele Tower (headquarters of Nippon Television). It was designed by Hayao Miyazaki, the renowned director and co-founder of Studio Ghibli, and while it’s not exactly drawn from his 2004 film Howl’s Moving Castle, it’s been likened to the aesthetic of the anime classic. The clock is huge: over 20 tons of copper and steel, three stories high and 60 feet wide. Besides chiming out the time, there are over 30 mechanical vignettes at appointed hours, including cannons, a couple of blacksmiths, a wheel spinner, boiling teapot and two bell-headed piston crankers. They all move in a delicate and industrious ballet, some reminiscent of a cuckoo clock and others like 19th century tin toys. The clock springs to life four times on Monday to Friday, with an extra show on Saturdays and Sundays. Each performance begins about four minutes ahead of the hour, and you can see it from many different spots around the Nippon TV tower. But get as close as you can so you can really see the detail. Anime fan or not, Miyazaki’s clock is crazy with detail.  The clock is located in front of the Nittele Tower (Nippon Television headquarters). It jumps into action every day at noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m., and 8 .p.m, and there is an extra morning chime on Saturdays and Sundays at 10 a.m. It’s a good idea to get there a few minutes early, so you’re ready when the music begins and the wheels start to turn. Take the Yurikamome Line to the Shiodome station or get off at Shimbashi station where several of the main lines meet."
97,Aokigahara Forest,"Fujinomiya-shi, Japan","A beautiful, dense forest in the shadow of Mount Fuji, with a tragic reputation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aokigahara-suicide-forest,"The Aokigahara forest in Japan has the unfortunate distinction of being a destination for people who are contemplating suicide. Since the 1950s, recorded suicides in the forest have been rising at an increasing rate of between 10 and 30 per year. In 2003, a record number of 105 suicide victims were discovered here. Japanese spiritualists believe that the suicides committed in the forest have permeated Aokigahara’s trees, generating paranormal activity and preventing many who enter from escaping the forest’s depths. Complicating matters further is the common experience of compasses being rendered useless by the rich deposits of magnetic iron in the area’s volcanic soil. Due to the vastness of the forest, desperate visitors are unlikely to encounter anyone once inside the so-called “Sea of Trees,” so the police have mounted signs reading “Your life is a precious gift from your parents,” and “Please consult the police before you decide to die!” on trees throughout. This does not deter determined people from committing suicide in this dense forest. Each year dozens of corpses are found by volunteers who clean the woods, but many are forever lost in the very thick woods. Japanese authorities have discontinued publishing exact suicide numbers in order to avoid making the place even more popular. Contemporary news outlets have noted the recent spike in suicides in the forest, blaming them more on Japan’s economic downturn than on the romantic ending of Seicho Matsumoto’s novel Kuroi Jukai, which revitalized the so-called suicide forest’s popularity among those determined to take their final walk. (The novel culminates in Aokigahara as the characters are driven to joint-suicide.) Locals say they can easily spot the three types of visitors to the forest: trekkers interested in scenic vistas of Mount Fuji, the curious hoping for a glimpse of the macabre, and those souls who don’t plan on leaving. What those hoping to take their lives may not consider is the impact the suicides have on those living near an area famous for being a suicide spot. A local police officer said, “I’ve seen plenty of bodies that have been really badly decomposed, or been picked at by wild animals… There’s nothing beautiful about dying in there.” According to some reports, forest workers must carry the bodies from the forest to the local police station, where they are put in a special room used specifically to house suicide corpses. Some believe that if a corpse is left alone, it is very bad luck for the yurei (ghost) of the suicide victims. Their spirits are said to scream through the night, and that their bodies will move on their own. In January 2018, the forest gained international attention after a YouTuber filmed and broadcast a suicide victim’s body on his popular channel. If you visit, be respectful if you do come across any victims of suicide. Contact the local authorities so they can appropriately handle the situation. It’s a somber place; one where the gravity of the circumstances should not be taken lightly. If you’re struggling with thoughts of suicide, there are international resources available for help. Many of these mental health hotlines are available 24/7 to anyone in distress.  If you're interested in hiking in the forest, it's located approximately two hours' driving time west-southwest from Tokyo. Accessible without a car. Must take the Fujikyu Railway to Kawaguchiko train station then the Retro Bus. Entrance is in the parking lot of the Lake Sai Bat Cave."
98,Sanrio Puroland,"Tokyo, Japan","If Hello Kitty were Mickey Mouse, this would be Disneyland.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sanrio-puroland,"With the growing worldwide appeal of Hello Kitty and her iconically illustrated pack of animal friends it is no wonder that the Sanrio characters even have their own insanely elaborate theme park. Built in 1990, Sanrio Puroland is any Sanrio fan’s dream. Not unlike Disneylands across the globe (including the one in Japan), the bright, loud, and eye-poppingly ornate theme park allows visitors to mix and mingle with their favorite super-deformed animals, not just Hello Kitty. They can visit Badtz Maru the penguin’s cave, Keroppi the frog’s pond, or even Hello Kitty’s own house in which everything is shaped like her head. The effect of walking through a blaring candy-colored cartoon is broken only by the live stage shows and fireworks around each turn, all of which is presented in a distinctly over-the-top and uniquely Japanese style. Of course there are also rides, such as the innocuously named “Sanrio Character Boat Ride,” which is near identical to the It’s A Small World ride at California’s Disneyland, simply seen through a hyperactive pastel lens. Despite the similarities to Mickey Mouse’s various wonderlands, Puroland is still unique among theme parks in its singular devotion to saccharine cuteness. Most people are well aware of Hello Kitty’s influence around the world, but again, much like Disneyland opened visitors’ eyes to their vast world of marketable Western animation beyond their iconic mouse, Puroland proves that Sanrio has just as deep a bench if you can handle the sweetness.  About a 10-minute walk from Tama-Center Station; to get here from central Tokyo, take the Keiō Line train from Shinjuku Station, which should be roughly 35 minutes' ride."
99,Shiratani Unsuikyo Ravine,"Yakushima, Japan","The magical, mossy forest that inspired Princess Mononoke.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shiratani-unsuikyo,"Look closely when walking through the mossy trees of Shiratani Unsuikyo forest–there might be kodama, or tree spirits, nearby. It’s dense with greenery and very quiet, sound absorbed by the thick moss. Gentle creeks trickle over ancient rocks, through the fine selection of cedars only found in Japan , and which are named for it (they are called “yakusugi” or “Yakushima cedars”). There are hiking trails too, some of which date back to the Edo period (the 17th through mid-19th centuries). It is also notable because it served as an inspiration for Studio Ghibli’s Princess Mononoke, which addresses the tension between humans and nature spirits in the forest setting. Lead artist Kazuo Oga was said to have spent many hours sketching the forest in preparation for the film. Take the one of the Mutsubanda buses from Miyanoura to the stop at Shiratani Unsuikyo park."
100,Nishiki Market,"Kyoto, Japan",This 700-year-old street food market features baby octopus and soy donuts.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nishiki-market,"Nishiki Market well merits its nickname as “Kyoto’s Kitchen.” It first opened in 1310 as a simple fish market, and has expanded over the centuries to become the best spot for seafood, produce, and local street food in the city. Walking down the packed narrow alleyway your senses are drawn in a hundred different directions. The entire market is just five blocks long, but over 150 stalls, some barely big enough for a chef to stand in, make it feel much bigger. There are traditional delicacies like freshly pounded mochi, Japanese pickles, sweet red beans prepared in a multitude of ways, and of course, Kyoto’s famous tofu. Some stalls will offer free samples, while the more expensive items may cost a few yen.  Just about everything at Nikishi Market will reward an adventurous palate. Baby octopus with a boiled quail egg in its brain cavity, soy donuts, barbecued quail, grilled squid, candied kumquats, and pickled gourds are all for sale, as well as more traditional fare like sushi, tofu, and tea. A few stalls sell non-comestibles as well. The inexplicably various shoe vendors, and Aritsugu, one of Japan’s finest knife-making shops, has had a stall here since the year 1510. Bring cash, be prepared for large crowds, and come with an empty stomach."
101,Gunkanjima Island,"Nagasaki, Japan","Once the most densely populated place in the world, this island is now a ghost town.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gubkanjima-island,"Few places in the world have a history as odd, or as poignant as Gunkanjima’s. The tiny, fortress-like island (also known as “Hashima” or “Battleship Island”) lies just off the coast of Nagasaki. The island is ringed by a seawall, covered in tightly packed buildings, and entirely abandoned - a ghost town that has been completely uninhabited for more than forty years. In the early 1900s, Gunkanjima was developed by the Mitsubishi Corporation, which believed - correctly - that the island was sitting on a rich submarine coal deposit. For almost the next hundred years, the mine grew deeper and longer, stretching out under the seabed to harvest the coal that was powering Japan’s industrial expansion. By 1941, the island, less than one square kilometer in area, was producing 400,000 tonnes of coal per year. And many of those working slavishly in the undersea mine were forced laborers from Korea. Even more remarkable than the mine was the city that had grown up around it. To accommodate the miners, ten-story apartment complexes were built up on the tiny rock - a high-rise maze linked together by courtyards, corridors, and stairs. There were schools, restaurants, and gaming houses, all encircled by the protective seawall. The island became known as “Midori nashi Shima,” the island without green. Amazingly, by the mid-1950s, it housed almost six thousand people, giving it the highest population density the world has ever known. And then the coal ran out. Mitsubishi closed the mine, everyone left, and this island city was abandoned, left to revert back to nature. The apartments began to crumble, and for the first time, in the barren courtyards, green things started to grow. Broken glass and old newspapers blew over the streets. The sea-breeze whistled through the windows. Now, fifty years later, the island is exactly as it was just after Mitsubishi left. A ghost town in the middle of the sea. From 1974 to 2009, the island was officially closed to all visitors, but recently the intriguing site has been re-opened to organized tours. The site was approved for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage list on July 5, 2015. The island is only accessible on organised tours. Nagasaki Municipal Government runs trips (ph: +81 095-829-1152), or cruises to the island are available from the Yamasa Kaiun maritime transport company (+81 095-822-5002)."
102,Yoro Park,"Yoro, Japan",Experience park where visitors are told to expect the unexpected.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yoro-park-site-of-reversible-destiny,"The primary attraction of Yoro, a town located in Gifu, Japan, on the eastern side of the Yoro Mountains, Yoro Park is a theme park described as an “experience park,” where visitors are told to expect the unexpected. Also known as the Site of Reversible Destiny, it was conceived by New York-based artists/architects Arakawa and Gins in 1995. Visitors to the park, which sits in a town of only 33,000, are led through the many attractions by a series of guides who know how best to manipulate the surroundings. Attractions include the Critical Resemblance House; the Site of Reversible Destiny; and the Elliptical Field, which resembled a large, bowl-shaped basin. The Critical Resemblance House has a map of Gifu Prefecture as its roof and is filled with sets of furniture arranged in pairs on the floor, the ceiling, and even under the floor. The Elliptical Field is a series of nine pavilions joined by an intricate network of 148 paths. The park also includes golf courses, tennis courts, food courts, and a special area called Kid’s World. Constructed in October 1995, Yoro Park was designed to incorporate the 100 waterfalls in the immediate area, which are another popular draw for visitors. Update December 2019: The park is currently undergoing an extensive renovation to restore some of the attractions. However, temporary pathways have been erected so visitors may still enjoy view and explore every sculpture.  Take the train to Yoro Station, and walk west up The hill. Free shuttle buses are available on high-visitor days."
103,Kochia Hill,"Hitachinaka, Japan","Every autumn, this hillside is ablaze with red summer cypress.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kochia-hill,"The scrubby little kochia plants, otherwise known as summer cypress, are not much to look at for most of the year, but at the end of the wet season they take on an extraordinary brilliant red color, lending them the name “Burning bush.” In Hitachinaka City at the Hitachi Seaside Park, a vast stretch of rolling hills is jam-packed with the vivid crimson bushes that sway with the breeze, with whimsical Oz-like roads winding throughout. Outside of the park, kochia is more often gathered for the more mundane purpose of making brooms, but the park takes advantage of how spectacular it can be when planted in such abundance. The park’s gentle slopes are full of flowering plants year round, often in enormous, monochromatic displays, and is also famous for its blue nemophilas, flowers with transparent blue petals. Overlooking it all is a looming ferris wheel.  To get to the park from Tokyo, take the JR Joban Line super express “Hitachi” to Katsuta Station. From Katsuta Station take the local bus from bus stop #1 and get off at Kaihin-Koen-Nishiguchi. Note, Japan's wet season lasts from the beginning of June to mid-July, so if planning to see the kochi plants in bloom, make sure to plan your trip accordingly."
104,Tōdai-ji Daibutsuden (The Great Buddha Hall),"Nara, Japan","This massive wooden building contains a giant Buddha, healing pillars, and tame deer wandering the grounds.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/t-daiji-daibutsuden-great-buddha-hall,"There are many amazing things about Tōdai-ji and the Daibutsuden or “Great Buddha Hall” in Nara, Japan, such as the gigantic bronze Buddha, which nearly bankrupted Japan in 751, or the fact that this massive Buddha sits in what was once the world’s largest wooden building (surpassed in 1998 by a Japanese stadium). There are also the ancient treasures such as an octagonal lamp from the 700s, but the most surprising sight at the temple is the deer. Known as Sika Deer, they wander through the temples, sleep in corners, and generally stand around as tourists take their pictures. Once considered sacred messengers of the Shinto gods, and protected, they were later hunted to near extinction. Though they have been variously protected and hunted throughout their history in Japan, their population is strong today. Many are tame and established themselves in cities and touristy areas, eating from the hands of delighted visitors. They are even known to come up and bite visitors gently on the buttocks signaling that they desire crackers and they will steal bags from the unwitting. Despite having been damaged and destroyed multiple times due to fire, earthquakes, and accident (the Buddha’s head fell off in 855) both the buildings and the statues have been continually repaired. Today Tōdai-ji, or the Great Eastern Temple complex, and the Great Buddha Hall it contains are in excellent shape. The entryway to the temple is massive, with two towering guardians on each side protecting the great Buddha. The Buddha itself, the world’s largest statue of the Buddha Vairocana (or “Birushana” in Japanese) is seen as the universal aspect of the Buddha, a sort of all-in-one Buddha. The statue weighs some 500 tonnes and is a towering 49 feet tall, with a 17.5 foot-long face. His hair is made of 966 individual bronze balls. Creating this massive bronze Buddha occupied much of Japan’s bronze production during the 700s. Inside the giant temple there are numerous artifacts worth seeing beyond the Great Buddha. As Nara was once the capital of Japan, a lot of history sits in this place. Among the many things to see are miniature replicas of the temple and the grounds, various Buddhist statues, and the (somewhat unfair to the overweight) healing pillars, wooden columns with a hole in the bottom that bring good luck, or you allow you to reach enlightenment in your lifetime and some even say entrance to heaven, if you can squeeze through it."
105,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,"Kyoto, Japan","The 10,000 Torii shrine.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fushimi-inari-shrine,"Originally established in 711 CE by Korean lords of the area, Fushimi Inari Shrine is the most famous of several thousand shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice. Foxes are thought to be the messengers of Inari and as such many fox statues can be found at Inari shrines. The foxes are sometimes seen holding keys in their mouths, the key to the rice granaries. Japanese merchants, in particular, worship Inari to bring them wealth and leave numerous offerings at the shrines, particularly fried tofu called abuurage which is believed to be Inari’s favorite food. Fushimi Inari Shrine is also famous for its countless torii gates, offerings by worshippers, that cover the hiking trails of the wooded Mount Inari towering right behind the shrine. These torii gates envelope a path that winds over 2.5 miles up the Inari mountain. You’ll notice that on each torii there is kanji writing. On one side of the torii gates, you’ll see the name of the person or organization that donated it as well as the date that it was donated. The oldest gates there are said to be from the 8th century and new ones are being added frequently. It takes about two hours to walk along the whole trail. Film buffs might recognize this location because parts of the movie Memoirs of a Geisha were shot here. Along the hiking trail, there are several teahouses where you can rest like a pilgrim of bygone days. Once you’re back at the foot of Mount Inari around the entrance, you can also enjoy Kyoto-style Inari sushi—rice wrapped in aburaage—at one of the many establishments that have served food to the shrine-goers for centuries.  The shrine is a three-minute walk from JR Nara Line Inari Station, 10 minutes from Kyoto Station. It is a five-minute walk from Keihan Electric RailwayMain Line Fushimi-Inari station. Recommend arriving early in the morning before the crowds and, if able, taking the winding path all the way to the top of the mountain under the unending maze of torii gates to view hundreds of shrines, foxes, and folded paper cranes."
106,Kaindy Lake,"Saty, Kazakhstan",Submerged trees jut ghost-like out of an idyllic turquoise mountain lake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaindy-lake,"Kaindy Lake is an idyllic mountain lake in Kazakhstan’s portion of the Tian Shan Mountains, close to the country’s largest city, Almaty. The lake was formed after an earthquake in 1911, which caused a major landslide, effectively creating a natural dam. Successively, rainwater filled the valley and created the lake. The lake is famous for the number of dead and bleached spruce trees that stick out of the water – remnants of the trees that were flooded when the lake was formed. The trees, together with the improbable turquoise water of the lake, make an incredibly scenic sight. Underwater, the imagery is even more stunning, as the trees have not decomposed and create the surreal vision of an underwater forest. Surprisingly, the lake sees few visitors, partly because Kaindy Lake is overshadowed by the more famous Bolshoe Almatinskoe Lake and the Kolsay Lakes, all of which are close by, but far easier to reach from Almaty. Thus, despite its proximity to a city with a population of more than one million, the lake retains a peaceful atmosphere. This lake is located in the canyon to the east of the Kolsay Lakes. Drive up to Zhalanash, the Regional Center, to the east of Almaty (turn to the right off the Narynkol highway just before reaching the Charyn River). Head from Zhalanash up to the Saty settlement in the west. This settlement is located 320km from Almaty. Turn left on the dirt road one kilometer before the village, by a cemetery. This road brings you up to the lake, but only a vehicle built for rougher terrain will make it. The lake is located in forested country."
107,The Last Wild Apple Forests,"Almaty, Kazakhstan","Granny Smiths and Fujis can both be traced back to Kazakhstan, where apples still grow wild.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-last-wild-apple-forests-almaty-kazakhstan,"It might seem strange to think that the common apple was not originally a universal fruit, but in fact it has its roots in one specific region of the world. The ancestor of the domestic apple is the Malus sieversii, which grows wild in the Tian Shan mountains of Kazakhstan. In the early 20th century, biologist Nikolai Vavilov first traced the apple genome back to a grove near Almaty, a small town whose wild apples are nearly indistinguishable from the Golden Deliciouses found at grocery stores today. Vavilov visited Almaty and was astounded to find apple trees growing wild, densely entangled and unevenly spaced, a phenomenon found nowhere else in the world. Scientists believe the Tian Shan apple seeds were first transported out of Kazakhstan by birds and bears long before humans ever cultivated them. By the time humans did begin to grow and trade apples, the Malus sieversii had already taken root in Syria. The Romans discovered it there, and dispersed the fruit even further around the world. When modern genome sequencing projects affirmatively linked domestic apples to Malus sieversii, Almaty and its surrounding land were officially recognized as the origin of all apples. Almaty’s former name, Alma-Ata,  means “father of apples,” and the town touts its heritage proudly. A fountain in the center of town is apple-shaped, and vendors come out each week to sell their many varieties of domesticated apples at market. Apples weren’t always a precious fruit in Almaty though. They used to be commonplace, and during Soviet development many of the trees were cut down for their wood. Up to 80 percent of the wild apple forests were destroyed. Today, reserves throughout the Tian Shan mountain range keep the last wild apple forests growing safely—except from foraging bears, who don’t care at all about botanical history. Pomologists report that the wild apples have a variety of flavors, depending on how the bees pollinate the blossoms. There are honey- and berry-flavored apples, sour crabapples, apples that taste like licorice, and a few strains that would be good enough for a supermarket’s produce section.  The apple forests only exist in patches along the Tian Shan mountain range now. There are various protected sections in the Ile-Alatau National Park, but hiring a guide to take you there is recommended as they are difficult to find."
108,Aral Sea,"Aralsk, Kazakhstan",Rusting ships sit in a desert where a sea used to be.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aral-sea,"A man made environmental disaster has left a once-great sea dry, the land polluted, and the locals inundated with disease. The destruction of the Aral Sea is a strange legacy of the Cold War, when the Soviet Union sought to increase its production of cotton. The decision was made in 1960 to irrigate land in the recently assimilated central Asian countries and develop their own cotton industry. At the time, the Aral Sea was the world’s fourth largest inland sea. By 1937, the area had successfully become a major exporter of cotton with little impact on the natural environment. But starting in the 1950s, aggressive Soviet irrigation projects stemming from the Aral Sea started to have an adverse impact. Between 1960 and 1980, the water level dropped by 20 meters, exposing sea beds, and increasing the salinity levels of the lake until the fish population died off. Today, the sea is nearly dry and has separated into two much smaller seas. Fishing boats sit aground, rusting in a vast contaminated desert wasteland. To make what is an already horrific situation worse, on the island of Vozrozhdeniye, in the center of the former Aral Sea are the remains of the Soviet Union’s extensive bio-warfare experimentation. Experiments with anthrax, plague and smallpox were conducted here in open air tests in the 1950s. The base was hastily abandoned in the 1990s following the breakup of the Soviet Union, the canisters of disease agents buried, and the land coated with bleach. In the years since the abandonment, the island has slowly become part of the mainland. A US anti-terrorist team visited the remains of the island in 2001, in theory to clean up any remaining bio-warfare agents, but a visit by author Nick Middleton in 2005 showed signs that there is still plenty to be worried about. He found the island crawling with local looters, disturbing old buildings, and wearing no protection. Test tubes and feeding troughs for test animals were still in place. Although some diseases like smallpox can be virtually eliminated by exposure to UV over time, the same can not be said for Anthrax which has a very long and stubborn lifespan, and once inhaled, has a mortality rate of 90%. The local population suffers from abnormally high cancer rates, tuberculosis, and anemia, made worse by the poverty caused from the death of the formerly lucrative local fishing industry. The causes for the diseases are being traced back to the pesticides used on the cotton crops to the south. In 2000, UNESCO developed a rescue plan for the area which attempts to reclaim water for the sea by 2025, but it is regarded as unrealistic by many. The people with most ability to directly impact this is the government of Uzbekistan, where the cotton fields are, but they are reluctant to make any changes as their country’s delicate economy hinges on the success of the cotton crop. The World Bank funded a small dam that has protected and even raised water levels in the northern portion of the sea, but most agree that the rest could disappear completely within 15 years. The remains of the sea are remote, reachable after a day’s drive through the desert. Update November 2017: The local Mayor ordered the removal and scrapping of all rusting Aral ships; the only example now remaining is at the Aralsk Port Museum.  The old fishing town of Aralsk at the north of the Aral Sea is on the Northern Kazakhstan train line, but is difficult to get to as it is between stops, and is a 36 hour train ride from Almaty."
109,Baikonur Cosmodrome,"Baikonur, Kazakhstan","World's oldest and largest space launch facility, once a secret missile testing site.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baikonur-cosmodrome,"“Dear friends, known and unknown to me, my dear compatriots and all people of the world! Within minutes from now, a mighty Soviet rocket will boost my ship into the vastness of outer space. What I want to tell you is this. My whole life is now before me as a single breathtaking moment. I feel I can muster up my strength for successfully carrying out what is expected of me.” Those were the words of Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961, minutes before the cosmonaut lifted off in the Vostok 1 spacecraft, becoming the first human to reach outer space and enter orbit around the Earth. His journey began at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the world’s oldest and largest space launch facility, set in the desolate desert steppe of Kazakhstan. The Cosmodrome was built in the 1950s as a secret missile testing site and as the base of operations for the Soviet space program. Using the name and coordinates of the small mining town of Baikonur, about 200 miles northeast of the actual launch complex, the former Soviet Union deliberately attempted to mislead the West about the facility’s true location. No amount of obfuscation could hide the Cosmodrome from America’s famous U-2 spy planes, however. One of the high-altitude reconnaissance jets spotted the complex in the summer of 1957, around the same time that the facility was testing the first intercontinental ballistic missiles and just months before Sputnik 1, the first man-made satellite put into space, was launched from its pads. In fact, as the most active spaceport in the world, the Baikonur Cosmodrome has a long list of achievements, some of which tend to be overshadowed by Gagarin’s famed flight. And occasionally, as in the case of Sputnik 2, an accomplishment is marred by a tragic back story. Laika, a stray mutt with astronomically bad luck, was taken from the streets of Moscow to Baikonur only to undergo months of training for a certain-death mission that saw her become the first animal to reach space. It was not until 2002, over forty years after the mission, that a former Sputnik scientist finally came clean about the details of the dog’s death, which had been caused by heat exhaustion only five to seven hours after the launch. Today, the Cosmodrome is a far less secretive place, and visitors can learn about the history of the Soviet and Russian space programs at the museum in the city of Baikonur just outside the complex. And for more explosive thrills, tours offered by private companies offer the public a chance to witness the launches of manned and unmanned space missions from the Cosmodrome facilities. The closest train stop to the Baikonur Cosmodrome is the Tyuratam station. The city's two airports, Krainiy and Yubileyniy serve only semi-regular chartered flights from Almaty and Moscow. The nearest town with scheduled service is Kzyl-Orda, which has scheduled daily flights to Almaty and Astana on Air Astana."
110,Big Almaty Lake,"Almaty, Kazakhstan",A brilliant turquoise lake in the mountains.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/big-almaty-lake,"Joining the ranks of brilliant blue lakes like Kaindy Lake and Issyk Lake, is Big Almaty Lake, which is situated outside Kazakhstan’s largest city. This alpine lake’s unusual teal hue and surrounding nature make it one of the most beautifully surreal sites in the country. Big Almaty Lake is a natural reservoir perched high in the Ili Alatau mountains, more than 8,000 feet above sea level, backdropped by three peaks that rise above the canyon. The color varies depending on the time of the year, but expect the brightest and most beautiful turquoise during September and early October. The lake takes on a more milky blue hue during spring due to the melting snow. One of the things that make Big Almaty Lake unique is that it is forbidden to swim in the lake, as it is the main water source for the residents of Almaty. Pipes carry the water from the reservoir down the mountains to the city. There are several guards walking around to ensure that no one oversteps the boundaries and goes down to the lake’s shore. Hiking opportunities are in abundance at the lake, as it’s located within Ili-Alatau National Park, and the famous Big Almaty Peak is in the vicinity. Do be careful where you hike and walk, however. Many routes are closed off because they lead to the Kyrgyzstan border, which has been closed since the collapse of the Soviet Union.  The lake is located very close to the city of Almaty, and can easily be visited as a half-day trip from the city. The easiest way to get there is by taxi. The fare there and back should be around 6000 KZT. If you order a taxi on a phone app, have it wait for you if you're not planning to be there all day. It won't be that much extra. You can also have your taxi stop up or down the way on the mountain to get photos on the gorgeous drive. Another option for getting to and from Big Almaty Lake is to hitchhike, although this should be done at your own risk. Visiting the lake itself is free of charge, but you must pay a fee to enter the Ili-Alatau park at the bottom of the mountain. The fee is a little over $1 USD."
111,Issyk Lake,"Enbekshikazakh District, Kazakhstan","The lovely lake that was naturally dammed, then naturally destroyed, then unnaturally saved.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/issyk-lake,"A 20-minute drive from the town of Issyk, Kazakhstan rests a stunning lake, its turquoise-blue-green waters contrasted against the shades of the surrounding flowers and trees. But it is the lake that almost wasn’t. The lake was originally formed around 8,000 years ago when a rockslide clogged up the gorge into which the water used to flow. For thousands of years, the picturesque turquoise waters sat, relatively unknown and unremarked upon other than by locals or explorers. In the 1930s, the region around the lake finally saw some development intended to bring tourism to the lovely body of water. In the late 1950s, the USSR established the area as a park and built a hotel and restaurant inside it. Issyk Lake was placed on the Almaty-visit list and itinerary for Moscow’s elite when they came for visits. It’s rumored that Nikita Khrushchev enjoyed coming to the lake. A picture of Lenin was carved into the rocks in the park and is still present today. The burgeoning tourism industry was dealt a major blow in the 1960s when a massive mudslide wiped out much of the infrastructure that was being built, as well as the natural dam that had clogged the gorge for thousands of years. It was reported that more than a hundred people were killed in the tragedy, but officials now say the number was closer to 2,000 or 3,000 lives lost, and the lake flooded out down the gorge. The dam was eventually rebuilt in the 1990s, and the lake restored, but this new humanmade body of water ended up being almost twice as small as the previous lake. Nature tourists have since returned to the site, but many of the locals who remember the tragedy know it doesn’t look the same. This being said, the waters of Issyk Lake, while smaller, still range into all kinds of stunning blues. The town of Issyk is around a one-hour bus ride from Almaty, Kazakhstan’s most cosmopolitan city. There are some small markets, mosques, and churches to poke around while in town. From anywhere in Issyk, the snowy Tianshan Mountains can be seen posing in the distance."
112,Bayzhansay Ghost Town,"Almaly, Kazakhstan",An abandoned Soviet-era mining town in the mountains of South Kazakhstan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bayzhansay,"These deserted stone buildings in the Karatau mountain range were once the envy of nearby Soviet towns. The abandoned mining town in South Kazakhstan was once a bustling place. With subsidized support from Moscow and highly profitable ore mining, many people came for food and clothing during the Soviet era. The shops were always full, and the miners’ salaries were much higher than in many of the surrounding areas. Polymetal ore with very high lead content was shipped from the mines about 90 miles to a plant in Shymkent. According to legend, one out of every seven bullets fired during the Great Patriotic War was cast from Bayzhansay lead. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, ore mining stopped, and the town all but emptied out. The houses where miners once lived, as well as schools, baths, and administrative buildings are almost completely destroyed now. Among the dilapidated stone buildings, there’s a mosque that gets a new coat of paint every once in awhile, and a few families live in the area during the summers. Winter would leave anyone stranded. It takes about 3.5 hours to reach the city from Shymkent. Most of the drive is paved, but once you must turn off the main roads you will take a single-lane dirt road which follows a river, on which you can only go about 30 km/h due to conditions."
113,Palace of Peace and Reconciliation,"Astana, Kazakhstan",Iconic pyramid from famed British architect Norman Foster designed to represent all of the world's religious faiths.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palace-of-peace-and-reconciliation,"Built between 2004 and 2006 in Kazakhstan’s capital city of Astana, the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation (also known as the Palace of Peace and Accord) is one of the world’s most impressive pyramid designs - second, maybe, to the Great Pyramids of Egypt, but that’s an argument to be had between fanatics of modern architecture and ancient construction. Representing all of the world’s religious faiths, the Palace houses educational facilities, a national center for Kazakhstan’s various geographical and ethnic groups, and a 1,500-seat opera house. The diversity is represented in the design of the entire building, which clearly resembles a massive triangle, 62 meters tall with a base that is 62 meters by 62 meters square. The lower portions of the triangle are clad in pale granite while the upper portions feature stained glass featuring doves designed by Brian Clarke. Because of the extreme environment in which the pyramid sits, engineers had to design a steel and concrete skeleton that is able to withstand the expansions and contractions brought on by temperatures that vary from -40 to 40 degrees Celsius. 51.122826,71.46546"
114,Zharkent Mosque,"Zharkent, Kazakhstan",This unique wooden mosque resembling a Chinese pagoda was said to be built without the use of nails.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zharkent-mosque,"Visitors could be forgiven for assuming they’d accidentally crossed the border from Kazakhstan into nearby China when they come across this unique former mosque, current museum. The Zharkent mosque dates to around 1886, not long after the town was officially settled as a far-flung outpost of Tsarist Russia. Zharkent was a small Uighur settlement prior to official Russian township status and the mosque was sponsored by a wealthy local Uighur merchant, Valiakhun Yuldashev. Yuldashev needed an architect who would comply with his demands to create a mosque and madrasa built entirely out of wood, using no nails. He chose Chinese architect Hong Pik. According to one local rumor, Hong Pik had created such astounding buildings in China that his life was threatened by customers who didn’t want anyone else to have what they had. Rather than forfeit his life or his livelihood, Hong Pik fled to Zharkent, the farthest place he could find a new customer. A competing legend claims that when Hong Pik finished his work and returned to China, he was executed for giving away Chinese architectural secrets. No one really knows what happened to the architect, but his creation still stands, built with wood from fir trees in the nearby Tien Shan mountains. The complex includes a madrassa and a mosque. According to the local tour guide, while classrooms were segregated by gender, instruction was available to both girls and boys. The mihrab (prayer niche) and original main entrance to the mosque are similar in style to Central Asian Islamic architecture found throughout Central Asia. But the minaret, mosque exterior, and minbar (pulpit) are more like  Chinese pagodas in design and decoration. Many of those decorations feature plants and flowers, contravening Muslim rules that limit depictions of living things in religious buildings. It can hold some 1,000 worshipers, with women using the top floor gallery and men on the main floor. During Soviet times, when religious observances were discouraged and even banned, the mosque was re-purposed for various uses including a store, a cinema and even stables. Eventually they turned it into a museum, which it remains today. The mosque has undergone repairs over the years to repair damage from wear and tear and several earthquakes. While it may have originally been constructed without nails, they have been added in various stages of repair and restoration. Inside the old classrooms are additional exhibits of local art and artifacts from the Kazakh and Uighur people who lived in the area before the Russians.  In the Latin alphabet Zharkent is alternately spelled Djarkent and Jarkent, and during Soviet times was renamed Panfilov, after a World War II war hero. It reverted to Zharkent in 1991. Depending on your map, you may find the town under any of these names. The museum is open most days from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. for guided tours, but hours posted on the door may reflect changes. While guided tours seem to be required, your guide may only speak Russian and/or Kazakh. The entrance fee is 300 Tenge per person, with another 500 Tenge requested if you want to take pictures inside the mosque. Although the “per person” or “per group” rules on the latter fee seem to be negotiable."
115,Valley of Balls,"Shetpe, Kazakhstan",Mysterious spherical rocks in the semi-desert of western Kazakhstan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/valley-balls-rocks,"Close to the town of Shetpe in Western Kazakhstan lies the Valley of Balls – or Torysh, as it is known in Kazakh. It consists of numerous ball-like rock formations strewn across a wide range of steppe land. The balls range in size from tiny marble-like rocks to huge boulders the size of a car. The phenomenon is poorly researched, but there could be a number of geological explanations from megaspherulites - crystalline balls formed in volcanic ash and then revealed by weathering - to cannonball concretions - a process where sediment accumulates around a harder core - to spherical weathering wherein the conditions are just right to erode rocks into spherical form. In this case due to the range of sizes the most likely explanation is that of spherulite formation. Visible from the Valley is Sherkala (Lion Rock), a stunning 332m white and ochre chalk outcrop with numerous fissures along its rim and even more rock formations at its foot. Close by are also the scant ruins of the Silk Road town Kyzylkala."
116,Charyn Canyon,"Raiymbek District, Kazakhstan","Nicknamed Kazakhstan's Grand Canyon, this natural wonder lies east of Almaty near the Chinese border.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/charyn-canyon,"Charyn Canyon (also spelled Sharyn) is a great place for a little afternoon adventure. Nicknamed Kazakhstan’s Grand Canyon, the destination is part of a national park and the Charyn River valley, fed by the local Tianshan Mountains. There’s a gravel road running along the canyon bottom, and smaller footpaths wind up and around the many formations and columns. The sedimentary red sandstone varies in shade from deep orange to light brown, shaped by millions of years of erosion. The multicolored rock layers are the product of different stages of sediment deposits, and are often crumbly to the touch The Valley of Castles is the canyon’s most well-known spot, with particularly eye-catching structures of a bright red hue. It’s about one or two kilometers long and 100 meters in depth, and can really scorch in the summer. If you need to cool off, it’s possible to swim in the river—or even kayak, raft, or fish; the local fish is called the osman. The entire canyon is a total of about 80 kilometers (50 miles) long. Charyn Canyon sits within the Uygur District, Raiymbek District and Enbekshikazakh District of the Almaty Province. It’s about a two-hour drive from Almaty; you can take a tour bus, hire a taxi, or rent a car. It’s become more of a destination over recent years, which means weekend crowds and scattered trash. Still, you’ll need to pack your own lunch and bring a bottle or two of water, since you’ll find no food stands or convenience stores. If you find yourself hungry or thirsty, kind Kazakh tourists will likely offer to share their food with you—an interaction that might just turn out to be the best part of your visit to Charyn."
117,Semipalatinsk Polygon,"Semey, Kazakhstan",One of the most horrible legacies of the Cold War is a site where the Soviet Union tested nuclear bombs on civilians.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/semipalatinsk-polygon,"Prior to 1990, Semipalatinsk (today known as Semey) was one of the numerous closed cities of the Soviet Union. Only high-ranking officials of the politburo knew about the going-ons within these cities. Nobody except those few with clearance were allowed to enter or leave these areas, and these closed cities did not even appear on maps or road signs. When the Cold War ended, most of these closed cities were abolished, and the secrets they concealed became known to the public. While most of these places were only strategical military locations or sensitive mining areas, some of these places truly hid incredible secrets – like the formerly closed city of Semipalatinsk. The Polygon was the primary nuclear test site of the Soviet Union. In total, 456 nuclear tests have been conducted between 1949 and 1989 at Semipalatinsk, including 340 underground and 116 atmospheric explosions. Altogether, the number of nuclear explosions at Semipalatinsk equals more than 2,500 Hiroshima bombs. A huge number of craters, partly filled with water, testify to these experiments. It was not the only nuclear test site of the Soviet Union, but it was the only one close to major settlements. The Soviet Union conducted these nuclear tests without regard to the health effects on the 200,000 residents of the Semipalatinsk area, who weren’t evacuated or warned during the actual explosions. Local residents soon became aware of what was going on, and witnessed health problems soon after the first tests. Cancer rates in the Polygon area skyrocketed and a couple of years following the first tests, a disturbingly high number of children with genetic defects were born. There was nothing the people could do about it, since they were not allowed to leave the boundary of the closed city area. Finally, in 1989, an anti-nuclear movement called “Nevada Semipalatinsk“ was formed, that forced the weak and crumbling Soviet Union to refrain from further nuclear tests and to close the site. Following the independence of Kazakhstan, the closed city status was abolished. The site may have been closed and the tests may have stopped, but the legacy of the nuclear tests lingers on. An area of more than 18,000 square kilometers is heavily contaminated and seemingly as many as 1.5 million people – a tenth of the total population of the country – have been diagnosed with health problems that can be attributed directly or indirectly to the nuclear tests. Even today, people continue to live in the Polygon area. Since this is one of the poorer regions of Kazakhstan, few people have been able to move away. Those who stayed continue to rely on contaminated local crops and water, and even dismantle structures of the Polygon to obtain scrap metal they can sell. Cancer rates, including leukemia, are still as extraordinarily high as they were decades ago, as are infertility and depression. Still, one in twenty children are born with severe birth defects – and almost none of the other nineteen are born healthy. The disturbing 2010 documentary film “After the Apocalypse“ describes the current situation of the site.  The place can be visited with a permit. Therefore you need to buy a tour of one or two days."
118,Soyuz 11 Memorial,"Zhanaarka District, Kazakhstan","The remains of a monument in the remote Kazakhstani desert dedicated to the only men to die in outer space, the crew of the Soyuz 11 rocket.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/soyuz-memorial,"Located in the center of Kazakhstan, 16 miles of desert away from the nearest road, lies a giant, black monument that only a small handful of people have ever laid their eyes on. This is the Soyuz 11 Memorial. Every man who has ever lived was born on Earth — a record that it’s estimated won’t be broken until 2050. But there have been men — three, to be exact — who died far outside of Earth’s atmosphere. Of the 439 people ever sent into space, only 18 never made it back, and of these 18, only the three-man crew of the Soyuz 11 died in “outer space”, defined by the U.S. government as at least 50 miles away from the surface of the Earth. The Soyuz 11, a Russian rocket which launched in June of 1971, was the only manned mission to ever board the world’s first space station, Salyut 1. There, the crew set the world record for the longest amount of time spent in space, at 22 days, which was broken by the American “Skylab 2” two years later. Despite a fire on day 11 and the fact that the entire spaceship vibrated when the treadmill was turned on, the mission went well. That is, until it was time to go home. Just after leaving the space station, the three crew members died of asphyxiation. This was caused by a minor technical mistake when the two bolts linking the orbital module and the descent module were popped open simultaneously (as opposed to sequentially). This doubled the exerted force, rupturing the valve that automatically stabilized the spacecraft’s pressure. The pressure inside the spacecraft dropped to zero in three and a half minutes. The rocket landed in rural Kazakhstan hours later, where a rescue crew went to retrieve the bodies. According to the chair of the Russian State Commission, the crew found that the bodies of the three men were “motionless, with dark-blue patches on their faces and trails of blood from their noses and ears.” To honor their memory, at the exact location that the Soyuz 11 landed in the middle of nowhere, the Russian government built a large black monument with three sides, each engraved with the face of one of the three crew members. Constructed in 1973, it was hardly ever visited due to its remote location, but it paid due respect to those who lost their lives for the Space Race. Unfortunately, it only lasted 39 years. In 2012, a group of visitors found that the monument had been vandalized. Only metal bars and scattered ruins remain. As of 2016 a new, smaller monument has been installed reading, “the feat of the crew ‘Soyuz-11’ will always be stored in the memory of grateful descendants. Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsaev proved the possibility of a prolonged stay of man is of the earth, laying the foundation for future space projects.” Perhaps the best way for the legacy of the crew of the Soyuz 11 to live on is in the hearts and minds of all who remember their sacrifice on our continuing journey into space."
119,Ascension Cathedral,"Almaty, Kazakhstan","In Kazakhstan, a colorful cathedral with many lives once survived the most powerful earthquake in the region.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ascension-cathedral,"The eye-catching golden domes and kaleidoscopic color scheme of the Ascension Cathedral in Almaty, Kazakhstan, draw visitors to the city’s Panfilov Park, but the building’s genius architecture and complex history demand just as much attention. After nearly 40 years of deliberations, construction of Almaty’s Ascension Cathedral began in 1904, according to architect Constantin Arkadyevich Borisoglebsky’s design. However, as Borisoglebsky had left the city in 1902, it was regional engineer Andrei Pavlovich Zenkov who made addendums to Borisoglebsky’s plans and oversaw construction. As such, it’s commonly called the Zenkov Cathedral. Construction was completed in 1907. In addition to the church’s striking beauty, the architecture and engineering command respect; at a height of 56 meters, the Ascension Cathedral is one of the tallest wooden constructions in the world. It’s widely believed that the church was built entirely without metal. However, while the vast majority of the structure is made of Tien-Shan spruce, there are a small number of nails, bolts, and other metal pieces. The church’s interior came from artistic workshops in Moscow and Kyiv, while the icons were painted by local artist and ethnographer, Nikolay Gavrilovich Khludov. The Orthodox community attended services there until 1927 when they were banned by the Soviet regime. The Cathedral was subsequently vandalized and looted. Over the ensuing decades, it served a variety of public functions, including an exhibition center, concert hall, and the first Central Museum of Kazakhstan. The Cathedral’s bell tower was also the site of Kazakhstan’s first radio transmission center, placed there in the early 1930s. Extensive renovations took place in 1976, and the cathedral was finally returned to the Orthodox church in 1995. The massive earthquake that destroyed most of the buildings in Almaty—then known as Verniy—in 1887 must have left an impression because Borisoglebsky’s design was meant to be earthquake-proof. He included what he called a “seismic basket,” fitting the building’s wooden beams with metal braces and brackets that allowed them to sway with the motion of an earthquake if another one struck, which it did in 1911, laying waste to most of the surrounding buildings. The cathedral’s survival contrasted so sharply with the surrounding ruin that local bishops called it an act of God. Zenkov’s response to that, if he had one, was not recorded, but he was certainly proud of his engineering. He wrote with awe that during the earthquake the bell tower waved like the top of a tall tree in a high wind, bent but unbroken.  The cathedral is located in Panfilov Park in the center of Almaty, Kazakhstan, and is easily accessible by public transport."
120,Zelionyj Bazaar,"Almaty, Kazakhstan","This sprawling market is a one-stop shop for traditional Kazakh foods, from mare’s milk to sheep’s head.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zelionyj-green-bazaar,"You don’t need to love either food or shopping to understand why the Green Bazaar in Almaty is a local favorite and landmark. This two-story green market, in business since 1875, puts most farmers’ markets to shame, with its wide array of Kazakh delights, ranging from fizzy, alcoholic milk to horse sausage. Rows of vendors sell meticulously arranged baskets of kurt, smooth balls of a dry, salty cheese made from fermented mare’s or sheep’s milk. The cheesemongers also sell kumis, a lightly alcoholic beverage made with fermented mare’s milk, which they ladle out of buckets into small soup bowls. Dried apricots, raisins, figs, and other fruit and nuts lie like little jewels on trays, next to fresh fruit being pressed on hand-cranked juicers. The smell of freshly cut flowers, spices, and produce lingers as one walks through the bazaar. From salty camel’s milk to fish roe to horseradish condiments, customers are encouraged to have a taste as they peruse the stalls. The meat selection at the bazaar is extensive, including an entire section dedicated to horsemeat. Here, beneath slabs of hanging meat, butchers prepare and sell varieties of horsemeat sausages, including shuzhuk and qazı, a spicy, garlicky sausage made from horsemeat ribs seasoned and stuffed inside a horse intestine. Sheep’s heads, considered a delicacy, are sold too. On festive occasions, koy bas, a boiled sheep’s head preparation (served cold, with a garnish of onions) is a typical accompaniment to beshbarmak, the popular Kazakh meat-and-noodles dish. The first iteration of the bazaar was built in 1875, as a stopping point for traveling merchants. Though its newer modern building bears few similarities to the original, the market still serves as a place where cultures and cuisines can mingle. Rows of vendors sell spices, nuts, and dried fruit from across Central Asia, as well as honey and fresh breads. There are even stalls selling kimchi. If you’re still hungry after the generously proffered tasting samples, stop over for tea and noodles at one of the food stalls lining the perimeter. And if you must be a tourist, embroidered Kazakh hats, jackets, and intricately woven slippers are some of the beautiful souvenirs on display.  The market is open every day except Monday. The market closes at 7 p.m."
121,Cosmonaut Grove,"Baikonur, Kazakhstan",Avenue of trees planted by cosmonauts before their space departures.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cosmonaut-grove,"In a tradition that goes back to Yuri Gagarin and the Soviet space program, each cosmonaut crew member has planted a tree before their departure at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The trees are located behind the Cosmonaut Hotel, which was designed for cosmonauts to rest before their space travels. The grove lines the Avenue of the Cosmonauts, as it’s called, and each is designated with a plaque with the crew member’s name and the year. Gagarin’s tree stands the tallest, while recent Soyuz crews have smaller saplings growing from the soil. A planting traditionally takes place the day before a voyage, although it can also be the week before, and it’s accompanied by a walk in the grove to remember the intrepid cosmonauts who came before through the trees that flourish in their absence."
122,Tash Rabat,"At-Bashi District, Kyrgyzstan",Extremely isolated Silk Road caravanserai in the middle of nowhere.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tash-rabat,"Today, we picture the caravans traveling along the Silk Road from China to the Middle East as a rather romantic image. This romanticized portrayal conceals the real dangers that the journey included, since the Silk Road crossed some of the most inhospitable regions imaginable, and many travelers died en route. Unlike its name suggests, the Silk Road was not a single route, but a connection of several established tracks, each with its own fair share of threats. Caravanserais were an extensive network of traveler’s inns along old caravan roads, either located at cities along the way or as outposts of civilization in isolated regions, providing shelter from the hostile natural environment and from bandits. Travelers who reached Tash Rabat have already crossed the dangerous Torugart Pass, giving them the chance to recharge their energy for the next leg of the journey through the Tian Shan Mountains, to pray for a safe passage and to restock on food and water. Some historians argue that Tash Rabat may have been a Christian or Buddhist monastery before it was turned into a caravanserai, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The legend says that it was built by father and son. As they were building cupola on the roof, the son heard a caravan coming from afar. The father asked him to stay so they could finish the work. But the son went to greet the caravan and fell in love with traveling girl. He left his father, who was so sad that he didn’t finish the cupola and left few holes in it. Inside the caravanserai there is little to experience except wandering aimlessly through the dark corridors which are lit only by small openings in the roofs. These damp corridors and rooms, which include a well, a dungeon and a mosque, are extremely atmospheric, especially since it is not unlikely that the few visitors to the site may have the place entirely to themselves. Silk Road caravanserais can still be found all along the former Silk Road from Central China to the Mediterranean Coast. What makes Tash Rabat stand out among the myriad of caravanserais, is its isolated location in a meditative landscape, which gives a good sense about how difficult and dangerous travel along the remote parts of the Silk Road must have been. Even today, with modern 4WD vehicles and navigation systems, venturing out here is anything but straightforward. Snow blocks the road, which connects it with the nearest settlement, At-Bashy, for up to eight months a year. Even without snow blocking the road, constant landslides and avalanches, not to mention regular earthquakes and floodings often turn the road into a mere suggestion. Therefore, the road leading to Tash Rabat should under no circumstances be tackled without a local driver. Altitude sickness is another threat, which should not be taken lightly, since the caravanserai is located at a height of 3,500 meters. If a sudden change in road conditions make a return journey impossible, yurt camps in the vicinity of Tash Rabat can provide shelter. To the East, the road continues to the Torugart Pass border post with China, one of the most notoriously unpredictable borders in Asia, which is reputedly more often closed than it is opened, and where crossing the border can include several days of wait."
123,Muzey Sulayman Too,"Osh, Kyrgyzstan",An outstanding piece of retro Sci-Fi architecture built into a sacred mountain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/muzey-sulayman-too,"With a bonnet-like facade protruding from the face of a cliff along a sacred mountain, this location would have been the perfect setting for a Bond villain, if Soviet movie makers had made the Russian equivalent of Bond movies, or perhaps a settlement on a newly discovered planet in the Star Trek series. Muzey Sulayman Too (also spelled Sulaiman-Too) is housed within a combination of natural and human-made caves that accommodate a total of 13 exhibition rooms. The museum is unique in that the building is just as—if not more—interesting than the exhibits in it. On display are a mismatch of natural and archaeological items, along with a handful of religious artifacts that border on new-age spirituality. Ancient pots, a modern statue of the Buddha, stuffed animals, plastic figures of a prehistoric human, black and white pictures from the Soviet era, and a chamber for spiritual healing sit incongruously (yet intriguingly) side by side. An overwhelming number of plastic chandeliers light the way for the visitors. Muzey Sulayman Too is actually the most recent evolution of this location, which was first used in 1949 to house the Museum of Local Lore. The museum in its current form opened in 2004, but the building as can be seen today was completed in 1978 to celebrate Osh’s 3,000th anniversary.  The museum is open from 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. The museum offers great views of the city."
124,Dungan Family Restaurant,"Yrdyk, Kyrgyzstan","On the shores of Kyrgyzstan's Issyk-Kul Lake, a family cooks a feast that tells the sad tale of a people's exile.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dungan-family-restaurant,"In the small village of Yrdyk in the far east of Kyrgyzstan, a Dungan family prepares a traditional Dungan Feast in their home restaurant for inquisitive travelers who not only enjoy good food, but a good history lesson, too. In the late 19th century, thousands of Chinese-Muslims fled across the Tien Shan Mountains to Central Asia after their failed rebellion against the ruling Qing Dynasty led to their exile. The arduous journey brought many to Karakol, then a wild frontier town of the Russian czar’s vast empire. Their descendants would become known as Dungans—“the people from the east”—and their cooking would become legendary. The mass exodus would leave the Dungan people in a state of permanent exile, but while they might have lost their homes, they never forgot their culinary traditions. Mamieva Hamida, the mother and head chef leads the preparation of Dungan dishes in her family home in Yrdyk, a center of Dungan culture on the outskirts of Karakol. She even shows guests how to prepare the most popular Dungan dish, ashlan fu. This cold-yet-spicy and revitalizing noodle soup survived war, exile, and the repression of the Soviet era to become a firm favorite in Kyrgyzstan. But before delving into the culinary world of the Dungans, guests are first taken to the local history museum in Yrdyk. Here they learn from enthusiastic amateur historians and storytellers the legends and myths of the Dungan people, and the dramatic story of their exile from China to Kyrgyzstan. The family then serves up a feast for their hungry guests in their living room. A long table is set in the middle of the wide room, and the smell of home cooking wafts through from the adjacent kitchen. Chopsticks are placed alongside knives, forks, and spoons, as a family member pours out steaming hot tea as the food begins to be served. A Dungan Feast comprises at least eight different dishes, and it’s a delectable fusion of cuisines. There are Central Asian–style manti dumplings, Chinese-inspired sweet-and-sour dishes, and bowls of pelmeni that would be more at home in a Russian canteen than in a Dungan family home. The fusion of all these flavors, spices, and styles demonstrates more than anything the tale of Dungan exile from China, and the establishment and integration of their communities in Central Asia.  The Dungan Family Restaurant of Mamieva Hamida is located in the village of Yrdyk, a short drive from the city of Karakol. It's right around the corner from the village history museum. If you're hungry for history and Dungan food, then you'll need to book a spot in advance through the local tourism office."
125,Monument to Yuri Gagarin,"Barskoon, Kyrgyzstan",A boulder carved into the shape of the cosmonaut's head.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-to-yuri-gagarin,"On the south shores of lake Issyk-Kul in Barskoon, in the northeastern corner of Kyrgyzstan, is a giant face carved directly into a massive rock. Specifically, it is the giant head of cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. While the giant face of the first man to journey into outer space, complete with cosmonaut helmet, is carved directly from solid rock, the story behind its creation is less certain. It seems that Yuri visited the area just shortly after his historic spaceflight. He may have even stood on this very rock. At which point, everyone was so psyched about the whole first man in space thing, the boulder was promptly carved into his likeness. Later, in a meta tribute to the first monument, a second more standard bust was erected. A local rumor has an more whimsical version of the rock’s origin. The rumor says that this was in fact where Yuri touched down, a fact which was covered up by the USSR because it was nowhere near the intended landing spot. While almost certainly untrue (Yuri did eject from his capsule landing near the village of Smelovka, in the Ternovsky District) it makes for a wonderful origin story. While unconfirmed this may in fact be a recreation of the first big Yuri rock head, which is said to have been broken up and smeared with concrete after the fall of the Soviet Union. This newer restoration is said to have been paid for by Moscow.The monument can be found driving up the gorge from Barskoon into the mountains."
126,National Museum of Kyrgyzstan,"Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan","Time capsule of a museum, in which the Soviet Union remains alive and kicking.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-museum-kyrgyzstan,"Kyrgyzstan’s National Museum harbors numerous interesting exhibitions, ranging from excavation finds to fascinating ethnographical collections, partly housed in dusty cabinets. But for the few Western visitors that make it to Bishkek, the real draw is the weird Soviet memorabilia. Lenin is omnipresent in the shrine-like room of the Kyrgyz Soviet Revolution on the upper floor, where his conterfeit – alongside Mikhail Frunze, Kyrgyzstan’s own leading communist – can be seen on porcelain vases and on traditional Kyrgyz rugs. Soviet flags adorn the ceiling and the walls of the hall, and the Hammer and Sickle symbol can be found anywhere. Then there are the highly bizarre murals – rather unusual depictions of Soviet propaganda, since they were not created during the heyday of Soviet propaganda displays, but only shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The style is unique, since it forms a transition from typical Soviet propaganda to modern art. Arguably, the most grotesque mural depicts former US President Ronald Reagan, riding Dr. Strangelove-style on a Pershing, wearing a mask of a grinning skull, while being surrounded by people demanding “No more Hiroshimas“. Additional bronze murals depict key events in communist and Soviet history, among others, Marx and Engels speaking to the people, Lenin inspiring the masses, the October Revolution and the burning tsarist palaces. Sooner or later, the Soviet pieces will likely be removed from the museum, but for now they still remain in place. Update February 2021: The museum is currently being renovated and is closed to the public. The murals have been removed.  As of November 2015, the museum is undergoing a renovation, which may very well include painting over these amazing murals. No amount of begging or attempted bribery will gain one access. A giant Lenin statue dwells behind the museum however, if that's any consolation. Also, beware roaming dogs nearby... they do indeed bite."
127,Merzbacher Lake,"Ak-Su, Kyrgyzstan",Glacial lake that mysteriously empties itself every year.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/merzbacher-lake,"A strenuous multi-day trek is necessary to reach Merzbacher Lake, a lake so far away from anything, that even the label “remote” would be an understatement. The lake is located at the confluence of the Inylchek Glacier in one of the most inaccessible regions of the Tian Shan Mountains of Kyrgyzstan. Even in a country like Kyrgyzstan, so blessed with stunning natural scenery, Merzbacher Lake is truly outstanding. Every spring, when the frozen lake melts, the lake’s waters lap at the tongue of the glacier and successively breaks off chunks of ice. The lake filled with drifting icebergs is a spectacular sight, but that is not all there is to Merzbacher Lake. The lake constitutes a phenomenon known as a proglacial lake, a lake dammed by a glacier. Proglacial lakes are found in various locations all over the world, but usually they enlarge until the glacier retreats, or are short-lived in their existence. Merzbacher Lake however, is highly exceptional since the lake repeatedly gets emptied, just to get refilled soon after. The process, still not fully understood by geologists, can be described like this: the melt water fills up the lake in the summer months at a rate of up to two meters per day. When the lake is filled, it bursts out and completely empties itself within just three days. The release of the water occurrs when the dam of ice buoys upwards and opens up a number of glacial channels in the damming glacier. The water then discharges through the glacier into the valley on the other side of the ice, where it flows into the Inylchek River. When the lake has emptied, the ice dam lowers, thereby blocking the glacial channels. As a result, the lake begins to fill up again. The cycle of the emptying and subsequent refilling of the lake occurrs at least once per year, in some years even twice. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to estimate the timing when the emptying begins. It usually takes place in August, but in some years it has occurred as early as Mid-July. Because of the difficult estimate to reach the lake at the right time, so far only very few people have witnessed the phenomenon."
128,Bishkek Circus,"Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan","This retro, UFO-like structure is a remnant of the Soviet-era circus.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bishkek-circus,"Designed in 1976, this UFO-shaped structure was built to welcome circus acts from around the world—or, more likely, from around the USSR. Unlike many structures of its kind, the Bishkek Circus still functions as an actual circus to this day. In fact, this architectural gem is a testimony to the role that the circus played in the Soviet Union. Due to the lack of official records, it is all but impossible to pinpoint when the first circus appeared. Itinerant acts consisting of proto-clowns and musicians called skomorokhy wandered the Russian land in the 11th century, and they used to combine music, magic performance, dancing, and slapstick humor. They were more akin to street performers than to the circus, but the seeds were planted, and very soon, show booths began appearing where the audience was treated to trapeze and gymnastic stunts. The year 1877 saw the opening of the first stationary circus, in St. Petersburg. The target audience was the Russian aristocracy, which did not fail to embrace the daredevils that performed at the circus. After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the aristocracy was abolished and the circus was nationalized and transformed into a high art form comparable to ballet and opera. Under the aegis of the Soviet regime, circus acts like The Moscow Circus gained global recognition. Stationary structures purpose-built for the circus became common in all major Soviet cities, including Bishkek."
129,Dungan Mosque,"Karakol, Kyrgyzstan","Built entirely of interlocking pieces, construction of this Chinese Muslim house of worship required zero nails.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dungan-mosque,"Built by Dungans—Chinese Muslims who fled persecution in the 1800s—this stunning mosque is an architectural wonder that uses no nails whatsoever. Karakol is a town located on the South-Eastern shore of Issyk-Kul Lake in Kyrgyzstan. Founded in 1869 as a Russian military station, the town grew over time to become the fourth largest city in the country. Karakol soon became a popular year-round destination because of its ski slopes in winter and beautiful lakeshore and hikes available in the summer. In the 1800s, a group of Chinese Muslims—known as Dungans—fled political unrest in China and arrived at Karakol. The arrival of the Dungans diversified the Karakol community and injected the culture with elements of Chinese tradition and architecture. In 1904, a Dungan man named Ibrahim Aji commissioned the building of the mosque that was eventually named after the Dungan ethnic group. Ibrahim Aji conscripted Chou Seu, an architect based in Beijing, and twenty master carvers to build a mosque following two principal guidelines: the design had to conform to the Chinese architectural tradition, and it had to be built with no nails. These requirements resulted in a mosque that exhibits ingenious ways of carving and assembling each component of the building. It took six years to construct the mosque, which is held up by 42 main pillars topped by a three-tiered wooden frame. The result is a mosque that looks remarkably like a Chinese Buddhist temple, which testifies to the pre-Islamic history of the Dungan community. The color blue prevails, but yellow and red elements also stand out.  These colors are highly symbolic in the Dungan tradition. All along the perimeter of Dungan Mosque, the beams are decorated with colorful images of plants and fruit. Dungan Mosque was spared by Soviet purges, which destroyed the other eight mosques in Karakol, but the building was repurposed as a storehouse between 1929 and 1947. Following the end of WWII, Dungan Mosque was handed back to the Dungan community, which ensured the upkeep of the building to this day. Dungan Mosque is now the only example of Chinese architecture in Karakol and it is a registered historical building protected by Kyrgyz law.  The entrance to the mosque on on Bektenova street, a fairly short walk from the center of Karakol. Women can get robes at the entrance to the mosque, so they can dress casually throughout the rest of the day. A common and affordable way to travel around Kyrgyzstan is by public transportation, known locally as marshrutkas. Much like a standard bus, marshrutkas have designated routes that pick up and drop off passengers along the way. Karakol can best be reached from the capital city of Bishkek by either marshrutkas (five to six hours travel time) or by flight. The closest airport is Tamchy (IKU) near Lake Issyk-Kul. Once in Karakol, the Dungan Mosque is a short six-minute walk from the city center on Bektenova str."
130,Burana Tower,Kyrgyzstan,Lonely minaret stump of a destroyed city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/burana-tower,"This 25 meter tower, located in the Chuy Valley, east of the Kyrgyz capital city Bishkek, is the last remains of the mosque of the medieval city of Balasagun. Balasagun, established by the Karakhanids in the 9th century, has virtually disappeared. Only a few mausolea remains, some remnants of a fortification and this half minaret are still visible from Balasagun. Numerous earthquakes have destroyed the rest of the city, with fragments reused for newer buildings. Earthquakes have also taken its toll on the minaret, and the top half toppled after a major earthquake in the 15th century. The fall reduced its height from 45 to 25 meters. In the 1970s, the minaret was renovated. Centuries of repeated earthquakes in one of the most seismically-active regions in the world had severely damaged the minaret, and it was in danger of collapse. Strangely, the entrance to the minaret is not on ground level, but a couple of meters above via a metal staircase. Inside the minaret a steep spiral staircase runs to the top of a the final remaining structure of a lost city. A small museum, close to the minaret, holds minor finds excavated in the area.

131,Ala Kul Lake,Kyrgyzstan,A stunning blue-green lake located in the Terskey Alatau mountain range.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ala-kul-lake,"Ala-kul Lake is one of the most beautiful places in Kyrgyzstan. It is located 20 kilometers from Karakol, in the mountains at an altitude of more than 3,500 meters above sea level. The glacial lake surrounded by high rocks has an unreal blue hue. The lake was formed by tectonic movements. The ascent to Ala Kul is quite difficult. And it is easier, and best done in mid-summer in July or August. The trail is rocky and steep all the time. Because of the altitude, the weather is quite variable. But it is most beautiful on a bright, sunny day. At the top of the Ala kul pass is the best panoramic view. To spend the night on the shore of the lake is a separate pleasure. A lucky traveler may meet a flock of wild goats.  Do not take overly heavy things and equipment to hike to Ala kul. Do not forget that the climate here is quite cold. Before climbing is desirable to undergo acclimatization. Get relevant information before you visit. This will increase your chance of not coming back halfway."
132,Aalam Ordo,Kyrgyzstan,This mysterious complex of abandoned yurts and fading murals was meant to be a center of science and spirituality in Kyrgyzstan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aalam-ordo,"Driving along the southern shore of lake Issyk-Kul it’s hard not to notice a number of concrete yurts connected by a wall covered in murals. This is Aalam Ordo, a failed project initiated under a president long gone. Constructed in 2009, Aalam Ordo was supposed to be a center for culture, science and spirituality. The vision behind the project was grand. This would be a place where the Kyrgyz youth would meet elders to exchange ideas and learn without lectures, curriculum, or lessons. The community would live in 365 yurts, 36 of which were designated for the elders. The hope was that this would foster and develop a new generation whose ideas could reach faraway countries and bring a Nobel Prize to Kyrgyzstan. Unfortunately, Aalam Ordo never became the renowned cultural center it was intended to become. In 2010, then-president Kurmanbek Bakiyev was removed from power in the Second Kyrgyz Revolution. The project was never completed, and the complex sits empty now, a mysterious ruin slowly being taken over by nature. Colorful murals and statues can be found throughout the complex. The art features traditional Kyrgyz motives like eagles and hawks, and also events from recent history. One of the murals depicts a dragon terrorizing a village, stealing all its riches. One by one the men in the village go to fight the dragon and finally one of them succeeds; but instead of returning to the village with all his riches, he himself turns into a dragon that continues to terrorize the village. This symbolizes the cycle of corruption in Kyrgyzstan, and how those fighting it have become just as corrupt once they were part of the system. The mural even features the parliament building in Bishkek with snipers on its roof, a clear symbol of the political unrest at the time.  Aalam Ordo is located along the road on the southern shore of lake Issyk-Kul a few kilometers east of Kaji-Say."
133,Kojomkul Memorial,"Kojomkul, Kyrgyzstan",An unusual monument to a gentle giant who became a Kyrgyz hero.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kojomkul-memorial,"Kojomkul was a seven-and-a-half-foot tall Kyrgyz giant who weighed over 350 pounds and was reportedly able to lift and carry a full-grown horse. In another demonstration of his incredible strength, he reputedly once lifted a 1,500-pound boulder. Born in 1889 in a small village called Suusamyr, he became a sensation of his time by winning each and every wrestling and strength competition along the Silk Road. Feats of strength aside, Kojomkul’s many good deeds earned him a “gentle giant” reputation. He gained widespread respect for donating sheep and horses won in competitions to villagers in need, which would explain why after his death in 1955, the village was eventually named after him. A small museum in town houses a collection of Kojomkul’s belongings and some pictures of him lifting heavy weights. At the outskirts of Kojomkul village is an unusual monument dedicated to the memory of Kojomkul the hero. It consists of a mud building in the shape of a yurt covered by a rickety wooden shelter. Sightings of these wooden shelters are not uncommon, but they are usually no bigger than an average umbrella and are fixed in tombstones, whereas the one in Kojomkul is much larger, and it encompasses the whole mud-yurt. Along one of the poles radiating from the sustaining pillar, people have tied several cloths as a tribute to Kojomkul’s superhuman strength.  The memorial is located just beyond the village on the road to Kyzyl-Oi. There is also a statue and museum honoring the local hero within the village itself. A wooden pillar set in the center of the yurt sustains the whole structure, but huge cracks in the upper sections of the yurt suggests that sooner or later, the ceiling will cave in if structural reinforcement is not put in place."
134,Min Kush,"Ming-Kush, Kyrgyzstan","This village was once a thriving Soviet uranium mining center, but is now semi-abandoned and desolate.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/min-kush,"Min Kush, which means “a thousand birds” in Kyrgyz, was formally established in 1955 as an industrial town built around a uranium mine. At its peak, the population reached around 20,000. After the fall of the Soviet Union and closure of the mine, it dropped to just 2,000. Today the impoverished village is deteriorating; many buildings are empty and boarded up, and radiation levels can reach 10 times higher the norm. While some coal mines are still active, the majority of residents are unemployed, living on small pensions leftover from the town’s glory days. While houses in most villages are usually built for a single family and rarely surpass two floors, the buildings in Min Kush are at least three or four times bigger. Some were actually flat-blocks, while others were probably used for administration. Now, they look rundown, but once upon a time they must have been stunning. Some of these buildings were completely abandoned, and are crumbling and overgrown with vegetation. Further uphill is a mining center. It is cordoned off, but it is obvious that someone is using these facilities as animal shelters, and sections of the surrounding land were actually cultivated. A semi-buried building bears the date 1955 on its facade. Another building has huge, deep holes in its floor. Other buildings are simply locked. Beyond the boundaries on the town, there are four radioactive mill piles. The biggest pile, Tuyuk-Suu, is located in a valley, and two canals were built to divert a stream running in the middle to avoid contamination. Lack of maintenance has led to water trickling over the canals, making the whole area unsafe. The other three piles are also in dire need of maintenance. Cows, sheep and goats graze freely in the meadows surrounding the piles.  Min Kush is potentially dangerous to visit. Certain areas are marked with red warning signs depicting radiation, a skull, and (curiously) a human figure running. Other areas are cordoned off. Set deep in the Min Kush Valley, along the Min Kush River, the road to the village is bumpy, muddy, and dangerous, and with very little traffic. Although there is public transport, it is not obvious how often and when it comes by. A safer option to reach Min Kush is by a 4x4 vehicle. There is a camping site near the village, but with basic facilities."
135,Frunze Museum,"Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan","Dedicated to a Bolshevik revolutionary, this museum is a true time capsule of the Soviet era.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/frunze-museum,"Of all museums in Bishkek, the Frunze Museum is probably the richest in Soviet memorabilia and paraphernalia. The building is covered with images of common workers revolting against the privileged classes, Soviet soldiers, and the sickle and hammer symbol of Soviet Russia. The museum is dedicated to and named for a local hero of Bishkek, Mikhail Frunze. He was a leader during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, who later became a Major Red Army Commander. Although Frunze was not of Kyrgyz ethnicity, he was born in Bishkek to Russian and Romanian parents. He spent 10 years in a prison in Siberia, from which he escaped, and is most famous for the key role he played in the defeat of Baron Wrangel in Crimea in 1920. The building where the Frunze Museum is located was built after Frunze’s death, around the cottage where the revolutionary was born and raised. The museum’s three floors display all sorts of items from Frunze’s life: his uniforms and weapons, books he read, books he wrote, black-and-white pictures of Frunze with various Soviet figures and with his family, newspaper cut-outs reporting his military successes, and so on. Of note, there are several documents of Soviet propaganda, a large painting of Frunze with Lenin discussing military plans, a horse-drawn cart with a machine gun mounted on it, and a larger-than-life bronze statue of the Bolshevik leader.  The house is locked, but the museum staff will open it for visitors. It is fully furnished and the rooms are carefully cordoned off, but it is possible to walk through the corridor and take photos. Most of the informative signs are only  in Kyrgyz and Russian, but there is still plenty to see, making the museum a worthwhile visit for English speakers as well."
136,Jeti-Ögüz Rocks,Kyrgyzstan,"According to myth, there's a bloody explanation for the beautiful bright red color of this rock formation set amidst alpine vegetation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jeti-oguz-rocks,"Jeti-Ögüz is a bright red rock formation that lends its name to a nearby resort, a village, and a whole Kyrgyz district. To differentiate it from these other entities, the formation is sometimes referred to as Jeti-Ögüz Rocks or Jeti-Ögüz Canyon. The name of this protected natural monument in Kyrgyzstan translates as “Seven Bulls,” a reference a mythological dispute between two rival khans. The wife of one of the khans betrayed her husband to join the second khan. Conspiracies and subterfuges ensued, and the climax of the legend coincides with the slaughtering of seven bulls during a party in which the betrayed khan stabbed his wife to death. This caused a deluge of blood that covered the seven bulls, the khan, his servants and the surrounding mountains. Hence the bright red rock formation. For those unsatisfied with the mythological explanation for nature of the formation, these rocks consist of conglomerate of fragments of geological detritus. The oblique layering of these rocky protrusions is due to millions of years of sedimentation. In fact, these layers are more reminiscent of a dragon’s scales rather than bulls, and this resemblance probably did not go unnoticed, as the adjacent valley is called Ushchelie Drakanov (Valley of Dragons). A visit in the late afternoon will guarantee the brightest shade of red.  From the road running along Issyk Kul Lake, the directions for Jeti-Ögüz will lead to this stunning rock formation.  There is ample parking space nearby and an array of small shops selling snacks and trinkets.  Guides are available for hikes."
137,Saimaluu Tash,"Toguz Toro, Kyrgyzstan","These oldest of these ""embroidered stones"" were carved 4,000 years ago in a high mountain valley.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saimaluu-tash,"At this site in the Kyrgyzstan’s Ferghana Range, more than 90,000 petroglyphs are carved on black stones. In the Kyrgyz language, Saimaluu-Tash means “patterned/embroidered stone.” These works of rock art date back as far as 4,000 years ago, and were carved over time by a number of different groups. There are two areas with carved rocks. The longest one is more than three kilometers long and between the two there is a pond. The large galleries of petroglyphs appear to show scenes of hunting, shamanic rituals, and sexual intercourse, with a mystic meaning or for votive reasons. The oldest pieces are thought to date to the second or third century B.C., and new art was added into the Middle Ages. Archaeologists have found evidence of a settlement at the site from the eighth century B.C. to first century A.D. The Saka priests are believed to have used the site for sacrificial rites. The site was sacred to the people of Tien Shan and Pre Ferghana, and is even now sacred to the modern generation of Kyrgizians for spiritual and healing qualities. The area is reachable only in August by foot (six to eight hours of hard trekking) or horse (three to four hours) passing through fields of grass, woads, on the top of a glaciers in a constant ascent usually in a very small pathway.  To reach the area there is a ticket to buy in Kazarman, where is possible to arrange guides, a Jeep to reach the base where to start the climb, and horses."
138,Kuang Si Waterfalls,Laos,This tiered waterfall is so pretty it may cause visitors to cry tears of their own.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kuang-si-waterfalls,"Nestled in the Laos jungle near the Tat Kuang Si Bear Rescue Centre, the cascading tiers of the Kuang Si Waterfalls draw gawking onlookers seeking a little bit of serene beauty in the midst of the jungle’s cacophony. The vibrant blue waters that flow down the falls travel down through a series of pools before rejoining the flow of the jungle river. After ages of flowing over the rocks, the falls have etched deep lines into the stone creating a beautiful travertine pattern. The pools are smaller near the top of the falls, but tend to widen out nearer to the bottom eventually becoming big enough to swim in should the tropical heat inspire someone to jump in as it often does. The locals (who charge a small fee to visitors to the falls) have built out a wooden platform that visitors can take in the rushing waters from, or even dive off of in some places. Reaching the Kuang Si Falls is a bit tricky as they are pretty far off the beaten path and require a willing driver or rental. However the ubiquitous tuk-tuk drivers in the nearby town of Lunag Prabang are generally willing to take anyone interested in traveling to the falls for a nominal (if negotiable) fee. It’s well worth it to haggle your way into a ride to the falls not just to escape the heat by swimming in the pools, but also to soak in some natural beauty found few other places in the world."
139,Kong Lor Cave,Laos,"A boat ride through utter darkness, lit only by headlamps, reveals an emerald green pool locals believe is sacred.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kong-lor-cave,"Most visitors to Laos tend to focus on the north, but there are many reasons for venturing a bit farther south. Kong Lor Cave, considered to be one of South Asia’s geological wonders, is definitely one of them. Karst limestone caves are particularly appealing due to their unusual rock formations, but Kong Lor is no ordinary limestone cave. In fact, it was formed by the Nam Hin Bun River running through an entire mountain, sculpting the rock along its way. Inside, there’s a pool of water with an emerald-tinted glow that locals believe is sacred. Visitors can hire a wooden boat and an experienced boatman who will negotiate the sprawling caverns. They’ll take you through massive passages with majestic stalactites and towering stalagmites. There are also narrow passages that require skills and intimate familiarity with the cave, the depth of the river, the strength of the currents, and, of course, the itinerary. Navigating the cave is usually performed in utter blackness, aided by only the feeble, flickering lights of headlamps. Kong Lor Cave is still used by villagers to transport goods and, if visited at the time of harvest, tobacco as well. Located in Khammouane Province, in the geographical heart of Laos,  it can be reached by following a rural road from Ban Khoun Kham or by taking a boat from Ban Naphouak.  There are several accommodation options in the area catering for all budgets."
140,Plain of Jars,"Phonsavan, Laos","Believed to have once stored either human remains or rice wine, thousands of mysterious stone jars lie in ruin.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/plain-of-jars,"The Plain of Jars is a collection of large stone jars interspersed throughout the Xieng Khouang plain in the Lao Highlands. The stone structures are mostly made of sedimentary rock and, ranging from 3 to 10 feet in height (1 to 3 meters), each can weigh up to 14 tons. To date, the origin of the jars is unknown, though archaeologists believe that they were originally used between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago. Many researchers have theorized that the jars may have once served as funerals urns or food storage. As local Laotian legend would have it, the jars were created by Khun Cheung, an ancient king of giants who lived in the highlands. It is said that Cheung, after fighting a long and victorious battle, created the jars in order to brew huge amounts of celebratory lao lao rice wine. The Plain of Jars received relatively little Western attention until the 1930s, when French archaeologist Madeleine Colani began surveying the area. Though previous reports of the jars had cited the existence of goods such as carnelian beads, jewelry, and axes, the site was mostly looted by the time Colani arrived. Despite this, Colani discovered a nearby cave housing human remains, such as burned bones and ash, leading her to believe that the jars were funeral urns for chieftains. Colani excavated the artifacts, some of which dated to between 500 BC and 800 AD, and published her findings in The Megaliths of Upper Laos. Though the Xieng Khouang plain remains the central site of the jars, similar clusters can be connected to form a linear path all the way to northern India. The existence of similar jar clusters in other parts of Asia also led to the belief that the jars were part of a large trade route. Some researchers believe that the jars collected monsoon rainwater for caravan travelers to use during dry season. Travelers would use the water and then leave behind prayer beads or offerings in the jars, thus explaining previous sightings of jewelry and assorted goods. Though the caretakers for the Plain of Jars are applying for status as a UNESCO World Heritage site, the area still remains one of the most dangerous archaeological sites in the world. Thousands of unexploded bombs remain from the Secret War of the 1960s, and some of these arms still cause injuries to this day. As such, only Sites 1, 2, 3 and the Quarry are open to visitors, while a number of organizations work to remove explosives and apply for more funding. Any visit to the jar sites takes one past numerous large bomb craters and crater clusters. Further adding to the area’s mystique, the many varied casings of these American bombs are used extensively to decorate houses and roadsides in nearby of Phonsavan, the provincial capital. Scrap metal collection is one of the major economic activities here. Researchers have traced the jars back to a quarry a few miles outside of Phonsavan.  The area was also used extensively during the war by the Pathet Laos (Lao Nation, the communist political movement) who hid in natural and human-made caves here in the quarry.  Many visitors fly to Phonsavan from Luang Prabang on one of the national airlines' small, propeller-driver passenger planes. The fare is cheap. Buses run daily from Vietiane, Vang Vieng, and Luang Prabang to Phonsavan; there used to be a local bus service, but it has ceased service and now the only shared motor transit out of Phonsavan are the 9AM minivans.The three main jar sites can be visited by jeep/taxi arranged through one of the guesthouses or tour companies, or by motorcycles, which are easy to rent in town. Note that of the 3 most commonly visited Jar Sites (named Site 1, 2, and 3, although there are over 40 Jar Sites in total) Site 1 is by far the busiest and most touristy, being closest to the city and containing a small museum; Laotians and foreign tourists alike can frequently be seen taking pictures or Facetiming friends and relatives while sitting on the jars. By contrast, one might very well pass half a day at Sites 2 & 3 without seeing anyone besides farmers and cows. If you hire a walking guide, they can take you on a hike of around 1 hour between Sites 2 & 3; this hike should not be attempted without a guide as it goes through the private yards and houses of local farmers. From Site 2 there is a lovely hiking trail through a pine forest- cleared of UXOs, though the trail is not always maintained- to a viewpoint on a hill."
141,Xieng Khuan (Buddha Park),"Vientiane, Laos",More than 200 statues filled with cryptic symbols give this park spot an aura of horror vacui fantasy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/xieng-khuan-park-0,"The park has something distinctly ancient looking about it. Giant Buddhas lounge as Vishnu looks on, and Shiva menaces both with eight arms full of weaponry. In fact, the Xieng Khuan, or “Spirit City” park was built in 1958 by Luang Pu (translated as Venerable Grandfather) Bunleua Sulilat. Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat was a priest-shaman, myth-maker, mystic and sculpture artist with a large following in Laos and later in Thailand. Born into a family of eight children in Thailand Sulilat was supposedly mentored by a hermit named Keoku whom he met after falling in cave. Sulilat’s particular brand of mysticism integrated Hinduism and Buddhism and united the Thai and Laotian peoples. Later Sulilat was forced to flee from Laos to Thailand after the revolution in 1975. There, he built another sculpture park, Sala Keoku in Nong Khai. Xieng Khuan park was Sulilat’s first sculpture park and was built by the side of the Mekong River, about 25 kilometers from Vientiane. Said to have been built by himself and his students – all non-trained artists – the park is an astounding display of outsider artistry. The iconography is reflective of the imaginative the philosophy of this man, and closely resembles a south-east Asian interpretation of the mannerist gardens of 1600s Europe such as the Monsters of Bomazaro park, in Italy. The more than 200 statues, filled with cryptic symbols, concentrated in a small area give the Xieng Khuan park spot an aura of horror vacui fantasy. Among these ferro-concrete sculptures are skeleton thin Buddhas, a giant pumpkin with with a demon head for an opening and three floors representing Heaven, Hell and Earth as well as a gigantic 40 meter long reclining Buddha. Sadly, the place is about to fall into ruins because of floods from the Mekong River and a general lack of conservation. If it is now already a place of surreal lore that looks of ancient ruins, it will surely transform into something even stranger when it actually becomes ruins. To get there, you can take a bus (Bus #14 from Vientianes main bus station) which run about every 40 minutes. Be careful with hiring a tuk-tuk though; more than likely you will be charged an exorbitant amount to get there and back.There are sometimes food carts about that serve food and beer, as well as a nearby riverside restaurant.The entrance fee is 15000 kip for foreigners."
142,Pak Ou's Caves,"Pak Ou, Laos","Thousands of effigies of Buddha watch from caves set high above a legendary river, plus whiskey.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pak-ou-caves,"All along the Mekong River, the high, craggy limestone cliffs are packed with an innumerable amount of caves. Among this multitude, two stand apart, renowned for their beautifully imperfect contents. Primarily a religious site, the Pak Ou Buddha Caves are located inside a steep rock face that droops over the sacred site like tobacco-stained teeth. Accessed by a brilliant white-washed, zigzagging staircase, the boats dock at the bottom and allow for pilgrims and tourists alike to ascend into the upper and lower caves for exploration. Once inside, visitors are met with thousands of statues of the Buddha. Ranging in size, quality, and material, the only factor uniting these effigies are their minor imperfections. Roam long enough, and you can spot each; some are missing hands and or have chipped faces, while others list to the side or were replaced by newer versions less love-worn from ages of devotion. Before their discovery by outsiders, the perfectly imperfect contents at Pak Ou’s caves were only considered on an annual basis; during the Laotian New Year, practitioners of the faith would come to bathe in the caves in hopes of receiving boons in the coming year. Now that the caves have become a semi-known tourist destination, boat operators hired to take visitors to the cave often make a detour on the way home for the Lao Lao “whiskey village.” Here visitors are offered the opportunity to sample the townsfolk’s famously potent home-brewed potables before continuing the ferry ride back to Luang Prabang, which doesn’t sound like such a bad idea since there’s a man paid to get you all home in one piece. By the end of your journey to Pak Ou, visitors will have washed back ashore in Luang Prabang having touched on every single holy facet of ancient and modern life in a single afternoon – beginning with a watery trek into a world populated with misfit deities made more holy for their outcast nature, only to then chase the experience with a physical and spiritual reunion with the living, all while being shuttled to and fro atop one of the most revered rivers in the world.

143,Tat Kuang Si Bear Rescue Centre,Laos,Buried in the Laos jungle is a sanctuary for bears that would have otherwise been milked to death by poachers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tat-kuang-si-bear-rescue-centre,"Swinging in hammocks, playing with tires and generally frolicking in a wonderland made just for the them, the bears at the Tat Kuang Si Bear Rescue Centre have plenty to be happy about since they were all rescued from poachers looking to harvest their parts. Operated by Free the Bears, a fund set up to save imperiled ursines across the globe, the Tat Kuang Si Bear Rescue Centre caters specifically to the Asian black bear. The bile from the black bear’s gall bladder is a common component in traditional Chinese medicine, and unfortunately a brutal black market has sprung up around milking the animals for their vital juices. Kept in inhumane conditions, the illegally trapped bears would be repeatedly harvested so long as they could survive in their tiny cages. In addition, the animals are often poached to be used as food or even pets. Tragic origins aside, the bears at the rescue center lead a fulfilling life in the open enclosures that provide enough space and stimulation to keep the animals happy and healthy. Visitors to the refuge can stroll along the wooden paths and view the adorable (if grizzly) beasts as they lounge, play and generally look more cuddly than killer. There are also informative signs that inform guests of the plight of the Asian black bear, but even the sad facts can’t keep the rescued bears from being utterly heartwarming. 30km southwest of Luang Prabang, the Centre is located at the foot of the trail to Tat Kuang Si Waterfall"
144,Wat Dane Soung Jungle Temple,"Vientiane, Laos",An ancient jungle temple carved into a rocky overhang of the Dane Soung Plateau.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-dane-soung-jungle-temple,"The Dang Soung Plateau was once a spiritual epicenter in ancient Vientiane-Viengkham as evidenced by the numerious stone shrines scattered throughout. Apparently, today only a solitary monk by the name of Soubane inhabits the area. This plateau is also home to the jungle temple, Wat Dane Soung. The Wat Dane Soung is believed to have been built in the first millennium by the Mon, and features a number of Dvaravati-style Buddha images carved into the rock. Many of these images have been painted gold. In 1986 construction of a new temple began, but was never completed due to lack of funds. A few years later, in the early 1990’s, the Lane Xang Hotel built a restaurant on site in hopes of encouraging tourism. As local legend has it, the necessary ceremonies for appeasing the spirits were not performed, resulting in a fire that burned down the new building. The foundation of this building still remains and can be visited today. Adapted with permission from Exploguide.com dedicated to travelers looking for alternative and off the beaten track travel.  From Vientiane, go North on the road N°13 (going to Luang Prabang). Drive 22km (see the milestones) and you will reach the Houakoua village. Pass the bridge and, just after, turn left on a sealed road and pass Ban Naxone village. Drive west to Ban Nagnang. Go through the village till you see the school on you right. Take the dirt track on the right. You will reach a dam and a little lake. You must leave you car at the lake tourist area car park and go further 3km (W) by feet or motorcycle. Use a motorcycle only if the weather is dry and if you are a good driver : the track is very bad. You can drive from Vientiane to Dane Soung temple with a motorcycle.

145,Tha Bak Bomb Boats,"Tha Bak, Laos","Villagers have recycled bomber fuel tanks from the Vietnam War and turned them into very, very strong boats.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tha-bak-bomb-boats,"If you’re familiar with Lao villages, there isn’t much at Tha Bak that stands out from all the others. Yet, if you take your time to stop by the bridge over the Namkading River and look around, you may be able to spot some missile-like boats in the river. They are not missiles, but their shape is no coincidence, for they used to be fuel tanks on U.S. B-52 bombers, which dropped a massive amount of ordnance all over the region in the 1960s and ’70s, at the height of the Vietnam War. The high quality of this wartime scrap metal didn’t go unnoticed, and Tha Bak villagers started turning the spherical debris into boats—very, very durable boats. It is possible to pay to take a spin in one of these so-called bomb boats. Of note, northwest of Tha Bak is Nam Kading National Diversity Park, and Nam Kading River is a major entry point.  Bomb boats will probably be unable to go past the rapids, but up to that point, it can be an interesting ride.  The bomb boats are easily visible from the high bridge along Route 8 at Tha Bak. This point-of-interest makes for a nice rest stop between Laksao and Nahin for those motorbiking the Thakhek Loop in Laos."
146,Patuxai,"Vientiane, Laos","When the USA donated cement and funds to expand the airport in Laos, the Laotians built a massive monument instead.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/patuxai,"Patuxai is a massive war monument and triumphal arch in the center of Vientiane, Laos. It was completed in 1968, using funds donated by the United States – funds that were meant to be used for the construction of an airport. Patuxai, meaning Victory Gate in English (and variously written as Patuxay, Patousai and Patusai), was built between 1957 and 1968 in memory of the Laotian soldiers who died during World War II and the war of independence from France in 1949. It’s also known as the Arc de Triomphe of Vientiane due to its resemblance to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Patuxai, however, is slightly taller than its Parisian counterpart, has four gates rather than two, and is covered in distinctly Laotian designs. The exterior of the monument is decorated with traditional Laotian motifs, including Buddhist symbols, Hindu deities and female spirits of the clouds and waters known as apsaras. The ceilings beneath the four arches are decorated with further depictions of Hindu gods, such as Brahma and Vishnu, and mythological creatures like the mythical bird-woman Kinnaree and the three-headed elephant Erawan. On top of Patuxai, meanwhile, sit five towers, again built in the traditional Laotian style. Four of these are located on each corner of the monument, while a fifth rises up from the center, higher than the rest. These five towers are decorated with flower motifs and each is topped with a golden finial. Needless to say, the construction of the Patuxai monument was a costly project. The Laotian government, however, managed to fund the bulk of the effort with money donated from the United States – despite that money having been donated for an entirely different project. In the 1950s, the United States provided Laos with funds and a huge amount of concrete for the expansion of the city’s airport, which could then serve as a base for US fighter jets during the Vietnam War. But the funds and concrete arrived before any contract had been signed, so the Royal Laotian Government decided to build a massive triumphal arch, rather than an airport serving foreign interests. For this reason, locals jokingly refer to Patuxai by another name: the Vertical Runway. No mention of this is made on the sign attached to Patuxai. But the sign is strangely honest in other ways, stating that the monument was never actually completed due to the country’s turbulent history, and that “From a closer distance, it [Patuxai] appears even less impressive, like a monster of concrete.” Not a glowing appraisal, but refreshingly frank.  Patuxai is located along Lane Xang Avenue, within easy walking distance from downtown Vientiane (where most tourists stay). Visitors can climb the stairs that lead up through the seven stories inside the monument, passing through souvenir shops, a small museum and all the way to the top where the main viewing platform is located. Patuxai is open Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the weekend. The entrance is 3,000 kips (about $0.35 US)."

Tham Piew was a vast cave that served as a shelter for the local community seeking refuge from the bombing campaigns that were designed to contain the Marxist Pathet Lao. Today, Tham Piew is open to the public as both a memorial and a testament to a harrowing era in Laos history. There is a small interpretive center at the base of the mountain near the parking area that explains the significance of the site from a Laotian perspective. A visit to Tham Piew isn’t for the faint of heart. It’s a journey that should be undertaken with the utmost respect for the local community and the deceased buried in marked graves along the walkway to the cave. Visitors can also leave an offering with a Buddhist monk at the base of the steps to the cave in memory of the victims.  Just north of Muang Kham, follow the signs labeled Tham Piew."
148,Crocodile Stone,"Champasak, Laos",This mysteriously shaped boulder may have been used for human sacrifice in ancient times.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crocodile-stone,"In the Phou Khao Mountains of southern Laos lie the ancient ruins of Wat Phu, a Hindu temple of Khmer origins. Among the temple remains is a boulder with a very curious carving. The deep impression in the stone vaguely resembles a crocodile, but it could also easily accommodate a human body. It has been speculated that this stone may have been used as an altar to perform an annual human sacrifice in pre-Angkhor times. While most of the ruins of Wat Phu date to between the 11th century and 13th century, there is archaeological evidence that a temple existed at the site as early as the 5th century.  If human sacrifices were performed, they would date back to these earlier times, when southern Laos was ruled by the Chenla Empire. Oral tradition has it that once a year, when the frangipani petals started falling, the Chenla king would sit on the main causeway of Wat Phu. The king would pray to the spirits of the mountains and offer rice wine to two girls selected for their beauty. The girls would then be sacrificed to propitiate the gods’ favors for the coming year. To corroborate the veracity of this story, there is mention in the 6th-century History of the Sui that human sacrifice was performed annually in the Chenla culture, and the description of the ceremony matches the version in the local folklore. It may simply be a retelling of the description in the ancient text, but the fact that rural communities retained that specific tale through the centuries is significant. What is not known, however, is the role the Crocodile Rock played in this ceremony, if any. The uniqueness of carving makes it even more mysterious. Over the whole of Laos and Cambodia, nothing even remotely resembling the Crocodile Stone can be found in ruins from before, during, or after the Chenla Empire. Curiouser still, crocodiles did (and still do) exist in the area, but they didn’t have a religious significance. If the Crocodile Stone was not used for human sacrifice, the mystery remains: What was it for?  Wat Phou is about 6 miles (10 km) southwest of Champasak, the main town in the area. There is a museum at the archeological site, open daily from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m."
149,Vang Sang Buddhas,Laos,"A mysterious, hidden cluster of Buddha sculptures carved into the rocks.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vang-sang-buddhas,"On a road not far from Laos’ capital city of Vientiane is a handmade sign clearly different from the regular road signs. It does nothing to convey the hidden marvel it leads to. Secluded within the woods is a group of Buddha sculptures carved into the rock. Its name translates to “Elephant Palace” and references an elephant graveyard supposedly once discovered nearby. No one knows for sure when the mysterious sculptures were created, and guesses range from the 10th century to the 16th century. The biggest statues are about 10 feet high, but some smaller statues can be found in the surrounding area. If you look closely at the rocks, you’ll also notice less ornate carvings of Buddha practically hidden behind the greenery. Overgrown with vegetation, the whole shrine feels abandoned and forgotten, like it could be lost to time at any moment. The centuries-old figures are pale, their gold paint peeling and faded. The Buddhas all have peaceful, serene expressions that mirror the quiet, undisturbed atmosphere of the shrine. Heading North on Road no. 13, is a sign saying Van Xang. Follow the well-marked but dirt road besides it for a couple of miles until a cluster of boulders and heavy vegetation signals the end of the road. The statues are visible from this point."
150,Tham Sakkarin Savannakuha,"Luang Prabang, Laos",Abandoned limestone cave was once a sacred place of worship.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tham-sakkarin-savannakuha,"The Tham Sakkarin Savannakuha is an abandoned limestone cave founded in 1889 that holds the Wat Tham Xieng Maen, where local worshipers used to pay homage and cleanse Buddha images. Nowadays only the remains of these torched and decayed images remain. The mouth of the cave is outlined by a large stone block entrance accompanied by plumeria trees and two large ruined spirit houses, which were once a shelter of the cave’s spirits. The iron gate at the entrance is locked, but if you inquire with the monks at the nearby monastery, Wat Long Khun, they will unlock it for you and you can walk through the long, dark, damp cave. A flashlight is highly recommended. Adapted with permission from Exploguide.com dedicated to travelers looking for alternative and off the beaten track travel. Get tickets from Wat Long Khun Monastery, and a monk will guide you to the cave."
151,Craters Restaurant,"Phonsavan, Laos",Eat a meal surrounded by bomb fragments.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/craters-restaurant,"Set on a major backpacking highway for Western tourists on the border between Laos and Vietnam, Craters definitely caters to its audience. There is everything on the menu, ranging from Asian specialties to American standbys like steak and pizza. Overall, Craters is not that remarkable as a restaurant. However, Craters is immediately set apart from other cheap eateries by the giant bomb shells flanking the patio seating. For those who visit without any knowledge of history, the decor seems a bit off-putting, but with a little background, begins to make sense. The city of Phonsavan was absolutely pummeled during the Vietnam War. The American military was convinced Vietcong were escaping the country into Laos through Phonsavan. In response, American forces dropped 500,000 missiles onto the surrounding area, making it one of the most bombed places in the world. In the aftermath of the war, people moved back to Phonsavan and began rebuilding, often using the remnants of bombs in their construction. Craters opened up, ironically to serve Western backpackers from the very country that left Phonsavan in ruins. Essentially, Craters is a kitschy exploitation restaurant, playing on the war-torn past of the city to either deliver a socially-conscious message, or bring in tourists desiring to be photographed in front of the restaurant."
152,COPE Visitor Centre,"Vientiane, Laos","In the world's most bombed country relative to its size, this incredible organization helps pick up the pieces.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cope-visitor-centre,"The Vietnam War is still heavily present in Laos, the country that experienced the most bombings by the American military. Between 1964 and 1973, the U.S. dropped two million tons of explosives on Laos, and the effect can still be felt today. Unexploded ordnance (UXO) riddle the landscape, and cluster bombs in particular continue to injure and kill many people in rural areas. The problem is so prevalent, an organization called COPE—short for the Cooperative Orthotic & Prosthetic Enterprise—was created to help with the recovery of the victims of bombs, by providing custom prosthetics, rehabilitative services, and education to rural communities affected by the bombs to attempt to prevent future accidents. To foreign visitors, particularly Americans, the COPE Visitor Centre is jarring and incredibly informative. The shadow war in Laos is clearly presented, complete with a sculpture of a dangling UXO right at the entrance. The “COPE” sign on the side of the building is created from used prosthetic feet. Dangling inside are dozens of worn-out prosthetic limbs, returned by bomb victims in exchange for new prosthetics. Outside the building is a statue of a mother and child created from discarded bomb materials. Inside, there’s a full-scale replica of a rural Laotian stilt house, with daily household items created out of military equipment (and occasionally bomb materials) discarded by American and European militaries. It highlights how families are utilizing bomb materials while not understanding the danger they can cause. Pictures and stories accompany the displays, putting names and faces to the many thousands of victims of the military campaign in Laos. If there is one place for foreigners to visit in Vientiane, this may be it. From their website: The Visitor Centre is located in Vientiane, Laos, in the grounds of the Centre for Medical Rehabilitation (CMR), on Khouvieng Road, across the street from the Green Park Hotel. From the entrance of the CMR grounds, follow the road in and turn right at the indoor stadium. Then head straight towards the white building at the end of the road with “COPE Visitor Centre” painted on it."
153,Wat Phia Wat,"Muang Khoun, Laos",This ruined temple's giant Buddha statue bears the scars of the Second Indochina War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-phia-wat,"It is difficult to imagine that the diminutive village where Wat Phia Wat is located, Muang Khoun, used to be the capital of the Phuan Kingdom in the 14th century. Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese armies and looters ransacked Muang Khoun for centuries before the Second Indochina War broke out and the town was heavily bombed by the U.S. Air Force. Entire swathes of the town were razed to the ground, including a number of religious sites. Wat Phia Wat collapsed but, against all odds, the large Buddha statue sitting in the temple survived. What is now referred to as Wat Phia Wat is the compound enclosing both the new temple and the remains of the old one. The new temple is a modern run-of-the-mill Lao temple, and not much of the old temple has stood the test of time, with the notable exception of a Buddha statue. Of the old temple building, only the brick foundation and some pillars remain standing. This may not be the most beautiful Buddha statue in the country, and the bombing certainly did not help; the right cheek and lips are scarred, and one eye is missing. Yet, this statue mirrors the resilience that the local people demonstrated in the face of almost complete annihilation. Perhaps this is the reason why it is revered by worshippers, that can often be seen praying at the feet of the statue, burning incense and making offerings. A ceremonial sash drapes from the Buddha’s left shoulder to the opposing hip, and in its lap are several Buddha statuettes.  Muang Khoun is located about 18 miles (30 km) southeast of Phonsavan. The main road goes by Wat Phia Wat. If you’re coming from Phonsavan, you’ll see the ruins of a French colonial building upon entering the village. Wat Phia Wat is about 200 yards further along the main road."
