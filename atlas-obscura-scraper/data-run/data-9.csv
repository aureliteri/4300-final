0,Yongma Land Abandoned Theme Park,"Seoul, South Korea",Plenty of old carney magic still haunts this photogenic amusement park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yongma-land-abandoned-themepark,"There is a small abandoned theme park in Seoul, South Korea, with a quieted carousel, bleached-out images of ’80s pop icons, and “dodgem” cars that have long-since quit dodging. But unlike most amusement parks that have gone idle, this one invites the public to share in its slow crumble. Yongma Land was built in 1980, and had a fairly solid run as a small family-oriented amusement park. By 2011 tastes had moved on, and with attendance dwindling it closed down. Despite stories of a haunting or two, the root of its demise was likely just a matter of profit, when the construction of several, much larger and better located, theme parks lured the thrill-seekers away. Now in the hands of an enterprising local businessman, the old Yongma Land is open again, but this time to revel in the poignant charm of its decay. For a small charge of 10,000 won per adult (about $9, a bit more for professionals) and 5,000 won per child, visitors are free to roam the old rides, no fence-jumping needed. And for 30,000 won, the owner will turn on the lights of the ghostly merry-go-round for you after 8:00 pm. The fading colors and jumbled figures have proven attractive for musicians and other artists too, inspiring several K-pop videos (most notably Crayon Pop’s “Bar Bar Bar” video) and other photo shoots. With piles of dodgem (or bumper) cars, a rusting octopus ride, a Viking ship, and a displaced clown-motif roller coaster, there is still plenty of carney magic to inspire even amateur photographers.  Mangu Station is the closest train station to Yongma Land. From there, you can take a bus most of the way or walk. Head for the gate and pass through the first one to a second gate, where there is a ticket booth. If the owner is in the office he’ll take your entry fee. And if not, there is a phone number you can call. Just mention 'Yongma Land'. Although none of the rides work anymore, the owner does keep the toilet facilities maintained, and you can purchase some vending machine items (and balloons for photos) on-site. But be careful—the site is run down and things are rickety. And if the weather is a bit drizzly, chances are you might have the place all to yourself."
1,Trick Eye Museum,"Seoul, South Korea",South Korea's love of the silly photograph is on full display at this goofy collection of trompe l'oeil paintings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trick-eye-museum,"Trompe l’oeil is a classical artistic technique wherein the artist attempts to create a two-dimensional image that appears to exist in three-dimensions. The Trick Eye Museum in Seoul celebrates this art form with a collection of interactive optical illusions ranging from the unbearably silly to the classically whimsical. While the high-minded tradition of trompe l’oeil is certainly on display in the museum it is all in service to providing opportunities for goofy photo opportunities. Containing hundreds of oversized paintings for visitors to jump into, the museum allows guests to orient themselves in perspective with the images so that it can seem as though they are being crushed by a hydra, hanging off of a cliff, or taking part in Botticelli’s Birth of Venus. Some of the images are whole rooms that seem to have been turned on their head or their side allowing the subject to look like they are climbing the walls or standing on the ceiling. The giant paintings of sushi pieces reaching out from the frame and images of angel wings just waiting to be stepped into might come off as garish if they weren’t mixed together with works that ape a classical renaissance style, some replica of actual artworks that guests can make themselves a part of. The Trick Eye Museum continues to add optical illusions to its collection which now covers almost every wall in the space. In addition, the museum has also opened an “Ice Museum” next door that while retaining the Trick Eye name has nothing to do with tromp l’oeil images and is solely focused on ice sculptures and plastic displays of frozen water. The connection seems a bit strained, but both sites provide ample photo opportunities."
2,Cafe Yeonnam-Dong 223-14,"Seoul, South Korea",Step into a cartoon at this Seoul café that aims to evoke a two-dimensional scene.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cafe-yeonnam-dong-2-dimensional-cafe,"Warning to those with vertigo: This may not be the cafe for you. That’s not because it’s located on a cliff. Instead, Seoul’s Cafe Yeonnam-Dong 223-14, named after its street number and affectionately known as the “Drawing Cafe,” may dizzy you with the uncanny feeling that you just entered a cartoon. Done up in white, with pencil-like black pigment outlining everything from the chairs and tables to the flattened “shirts” on the laundry line outside, the small cafe gives visitors the distinct impression of being pressed into a comic strip. The pastel pastries and frothed milk topping the “flat” cups add a pop of color to this stark, pencil-and-paper landscape. The cafe’s owner and sole proprietor, J.S. Lee, was inspired by pop culture—specifically, a Korean cartoon and Instagram. The show in question is W, a web cartoon fantasy about a man caught between real life and, you guessed it, a web cartoon. While that show lasted only 16 episodes, Lee’s cafe, though still young, seems to have staying power. That’s partly due to his other online muse: The cafe was designed to be as Instagrammable as possible. Locals and travelers alike line up to visit the small space, located in Seoul’s Yeonnam-dong neighborhood, to snap a pic or 10 and to dine on deceptively 2-D coffees, pastries, and rich smoothies adorned in chocolate coins. Visitors are warned to take care, however, lest they walk through the cartoon door and find themselves stuck starring in their own multidimensional web series.  The cafe is open daily from 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., though visitors should be warned: The line to enter is often quite lengthy with crowds clamoring for their photo op."
3,Imsil Cheese Theme Park,"Imsil-gun, South Korea",A 32-acre fun park dedicated to all things cheese.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/imsil-cheese-theme-park,"Up until a few decades ago, many people in Korea had never heard of cheese, let alone tasted it or made it. Now a 32-acre cheese-themed fun park in the small county of Imsil is an expression of the country’s love affair with the food. The introduction of cheese to the Korean diet is traced back to 1958, when a Belgian priest came to Imsil in the Jeollabuk-do region as a missionary, where he raised goats and started to make his own cheese. The governor of Imsil asked him to teach the skill to the whole community. And so Imsil became the mecca of cheese in Korea. The Imsil Cheese Theme Park, opened in 2004, is a cheese heaven where you can learn about, make, and eat the delightful dairy, ride down the slide past the goats to the Cheese Playland, and stroll the walkways checking out the cheese-wheel buildings and various cartoon statues that dot the park. The park has a few “cheese experience” centers where you can make cheese, a milk processing factory, a local specialty shop, two restaurants, and a science lab that researches different methods for making the best cheese.  The Cheese Theme Park is open Tuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., closed on major holidays."
4,Jeju Glass Castle Theme Park,"Jeju-si, South Korea","A theme park made of glass, from the gleaming books on the shelves to the crystal fish in the mirror lake.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jeju-glass-castle-theme-park,"“Museum” may be a more apt term for the Jeju Glass Castle Theme Park, since everything is made from shaped glass and is not really conducive to the roughhousing usually associated with a raucous fun fair. The delicate collection is divided into indoor and outdoor sections, each with their own variety of delicate glasswork. The exterior garden features such amazingly naturalistic installations as a glass waterfall, glass flowerbeds, and lake made of mirrors with fish constructed out of used soju (a popular Korean alcohol) bottles. The indoor sights include a towering green glass beanstalk in the center of the exhibition hall, a room full of mirrors where visitors can get lost in their infinite reflections, and even a glass bookshelf with glass books. The bright crystalline colors of the over 200 pieces at the castle are mainly not to be touched lest the entire site comes crashing down from an errant poke, but there are a number interactive bits such as the glass drums which attendees can bang on if they dare. For an extra fee, visitors can even experience making their own glass creations. The Jeju Glass Castle Theme Park bills itself as an attraction for the whole family. Just make sure nobody trips."
5,Gonjiam Psychiatric Hospital,"Gwangju-si, South Korea",The abandoned hospital whose elaborate ghost stories cover up the dirty truth - an uneventful sanitation issue and other mundane reasons for its demise.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gonjiam-psychiatric-hospital,"The Gonjiam Psychiatric hospital has been called one of the most haunted places in South Korea and CNN has claimed it was one of the freakiest places in the world, but the truth of this place isn’t the supernatural hotbed that makes for good media fodder. The media likes to repeat legends of mysterious deaths, mad doctors that were as crazy as the patients in the asylum, and other “fakelore” to hype the creepy factor of the place, but the hospital was closed in the 1990s and abandoned for more mundane reasons than their tall tales would have you believe. Gonjiam was forced to close mainly due to economic downturns, unsanitary conditions, and problems with the sewage disposal system, not due to insane doctors or murderous patients. As the sewage problem grew, the owner left the country and did not leave documentation behind about the land or the buildings on it. Eventually, the hospital just closed its doors and it has been abandoned ever since, unless you count the numerous tourists, camera crews, and ghost hunters who come to stroll through the area, looking for evidence of paranormal activity or the proverbial skeletons in the closets of the asylum. The hospital is technically closed to the public and locals do not encourage tourists or give directions to the asylum willingly but roughly a thousand people break in and roam the grounds of Gonjiam Psychiatric hospital every year. The buildings stand complete with rusted out machines, hospital remnants, trash, and filthy mattresses, adding to its creepy and haunted reputation. In 2018, they released a horror film called “Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum” about the Gonjiam Psychiatric Hospital. Update: This was demolished in May 2018."
6,Third Tunnel of Aggression,"Paju, South Korea",Secret North Korean passage discovered below the world's most dangerous border.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/third-tunnel-of-aggression,"For the most part, every inch of the world can be explored. If you can fly, drive or walk to it, it’s fair game. The Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea represents one of the few stretches of land that is off limits, or at least the surface of it is. There are tunnels, it turns out, underground that can be visited. Called the Third Tunnel of Aggression, it was built by North Korea in the 1970s and discovered in 1978 by South Korea. It was the third tunnel found by the South—a total of four have been discovered—and it is rumored there may be more than a dozen more undiscovered North Korean passages. At the time of its discovery, the United Nations estimated the North could move 30,000 men per hour through the tunnel to the Southern side. After initially denying its existence, the North claimed that the Third Tunnel was a coal mine, going as far as to rub black coal dust on the walls. That tactic obviously failed and the South took control of the tunnel, blocking off the actual demarcation line with concrete barriers. Nowadays, the passage snakes beneath the divided nations for over a mile and, at its outset, looks like a space-age tunnel from a science fiction movie. Although the tunnel is available for visitors on tours and even begins with a gift shop, deeper down the two-by-two-meter tunnel are stark reminders of the danger the tunnel represents. As you walk along the path, the light dims and visitors are left only with moist, craggy walls and the faint flickering lights installed along the way. You can walk a full 265 meters until hitting the divider installed to protect the South from attacks by the North.  Pictures are not allowed inside of the tunnel, making a journey down the burrow a haunting and visceral experience. Pre-approved tours can be arranged online, and most tours of the DMZ from Panmunjom include the Third Tunnel of Aggression. You'll be shown a South Korean-produced video detailing that nation's version of events surrounding the tunnel's discovery before you'll be allowed to enter the tunnel."
7,Coffee Hanyakbang,"Seoul, South Korea","About as hidden as can be, this specialty coffee shop is wedged between multi-story buildings at the end of a dark, skinny alleyway in Seoul.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/coffee-hanyakbang,"In a city renowned for its café culture, you might not think to squeeze down a narrow, unmarked alley to find the right cup of coffee. But you’d be well advised to trek down to Coffee Hanyakbang in the Euljiro area of Seoul. Never mind that it’s not visible from the street. The cafe’s interior sports a blend of Chinese and Korean designs, and a variety of Chinese antiques imported by the owners are on display. But the overall feeling inside is rustic, with a menu made from an old plank of wood and a gaping hole in the concrete ceiling revealing the pipes above the establishment. Hanyakbang has become well-known among coffee connoisseurs, serving delicious single-origin, hand-drip coffee at decent prices. The beans are roasted by hand in the back corner of the café and are ground on site, producing a fresh aroma that washes over you like a wave as you enter. The baristas, all dressed neatly in white, treat their work like a science, homing in on every pour to bring you the optimal cup. It’s the definition of a hidden gem in a city full of them, a quiet delight just far enough away from the hustle and bustle.  Take the subway to Euljiro 3-ga Station, and leave through Exit 1. Walk down the street until you reach the first intersection, then turn right. Walk thirty metres down the road. The alleyway will be on your right, next to the Ginseng Chicken Shop."
8,Jeju Loveland,"Jeju-si, South Korea",South Korea's only sex-themed park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jeju-loveland,"Korea’s only sexual theme park, Jeju Loveland was created in 2004 by 20 artists who graduated from Honglk University in Seoul. The exhibition halls that house the gift shop and gallery of the park are modeled after traditional Korean architecture, but very little else is of a “traditional” nature in this park. Bulkkeuni (a phallus wearing yellow mittens) and Saekkeuni (a vagina modeling a floppy hat and bow), the park’s mascots, welcome visitors through the front gates. The restrooms adhere to the sexual theme as well: two breasts for handles on the men’s door, and an erect penis as a doorknob for the women’s door. The outdoor theme park features 140 sculptures representing humans in various sexual positions. After the Korean War, the island became a popular honeymoon destination for Korean couples, due to the island’s warm climate. Many of the couples had wed because of arranged marriages, and the island also became known for being a center of sex education. Visitors are required to be at least 18 years old, and a separate play area is available for minors while adults visit. Update as of December 2022: location is currently closed and will reopen March 2023."
9,Daewonsa Temple,"Pohang, South Korea","To enter the lower hall of this temple, you must first walk through a dragon.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/daewonsa-temple,"Daewonsa Temple isn’t like the other temples dotting South Korea’s countryside and nestled within its cities. To enter its lower hall, you must first step through the mouth of a dragon. The dragon’s body twists roughly 330 feet through trees and bushes. Why a giant dragon? The reptilian beasts represent good fortune, spiritual clarity, and in Buddhism, they are the protectors of the Buddha and the temples. This temple—aptly nicknamed the “Dragon Temple”—built a giant dragon to ensure ultimate fortune, clarity, and protection. In addition to offering protection, the coiled monster acts like a long, winding hallway. It’s filled with religious statues and artwork that tell the story of the Buddha, so your journey through the bowels of the beast is actually an educational experience. While making your way through the dragon’s body, you’ll pass a meditation area, Buddhist artwork, and dozens of little golden Buddha statues. A door within the dragon leads to the lower level of the temple. Apart from the colorful dragon, the main temple is stunning: the backdrop of the mountains, the peaceful quiet, and the two dragon heads that guard the temple make it a beautiful, unique temple experience. Surprisingly, this temple isn’t very popular with tourists, so it’s a great place to peacefully explore. From Pohang Bus Terminal, take bus #510 for 34 stops, about 50 minutes, and get off at the Chilpo 1-ri stop. Walk about 10 minutes down a dirt road to Daewonsa Temple."
10,Oedo Botania,"Geoje-si, South Korea",One man and his wife have turned a barren Korean island into a fantastical botanical wonderland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oedo-botania,"A number of small islands surround the southern coast of South Korea, but few compare to the unique natural beauty of Oedo Botanica, a former bit of barren rock that has been wholly transformed into a diverse botanical garden. In 1969, a man named Lee Chang-ho took shelter from a squall in the lee of Oedo, a tiny heap of rocks sticking out of the green waters of Hallyeohaesang National Park off the southeast coast of South Korea. Lee saw potential in the rocky little spot, and in that same year, moved he and his wife, Choi Ho Suk, to the island. At first they tried to harvest tangerines and raise pigs, but neither crop took to the land, so they began thinking about simply transforming the whole island into a botanical garden. After getting approval in 1976, Lee and his wife started growing what would eventually become a stunning botanical garden coating the entire surface of the island. After almost 30 years of growth and development, the little island now sports, trees, flowers, shrubs, and even cactus, and rare species of agave cascading down the island’s gentle slopes. The carefully manicured paths and precisely sculpted topiaries add a fantasy element to the setting, making it all seem a bit unreal. All of this, grown under the couples’ loving care. The island has been completely transformed into a little slice of paradise, its flower-covered hillsides and perfumed air are popular with Korean vacationers and tourists from around the world—those fortunate enough to learn about the island from locals at least. The Oedo Botanica is accessible by ferry from the nearby port of Gujora, and continues to be hailed for its picturesque statuary, hiking paths, scenic vistas of nearby Geoje Island, and thousands upon thousands of species of lush plant varieties. Not a bad place to take port in a storm. Oedo lies adjacent to the larger and much more populous island of Geoje, and is only accessible by ferry. From Geoje's main cities of Okpo or Gohyeon, take a bus bound for the smaller town of Jangseungpo on Geoje's east coast. From there it's an easy walk to the Oedo ferry terminal at the port of Gujora, and a 20-minute voyage to Oedo's dock."
11,Museum Kimchikan,"Seoul, South Korea","Tracking the 1,500-year history of Korea's star cabbage.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-kimchikan,"In 1988, when the top international athletes were competing for medals at the Seoul Olympics in South Korea, a new star was introduced to the world, one that had nothing to do with sport. It was the first time kimchi, a spicy fermented cabbage dish, was experienced by such a wide variety of people. This marked the start of kimchi’s global journey. Now the dish, which is a traditional staple of both North and South Korea, can be seen on menus around the world. During the 1988 Olympics, visitors who tasted the dish and wanted to know more visited the Kimchi Museum, which opened in 1986 and had been moved to the Korea World Trade Center Complex for the event. This institution was later revamped and opened its doors as the Museum Kimchikan in 2015. Now, the museum showcases the 1,500-year-history of kimchi, the production of which is traditionally a community affair. Every fall, families gather to blend the chopped vegetables with spices and stock up for the winter ahead. The process is known as kimjang and this collaborative tradition was recognized in 2013 by UNESCO as a piece of intangible cultural heritage. The most well-known version consists of Napa cabbage, scallions, and chili and garlic powders. A wide variety of vegetables and seafood is used in the nearly 180 regional forms of the dish. At the Museum Kimchikan, visitors can view the production technique, which uses lactobacillus bacteria, under a microscope. They can also watch documentaries about the history of kimjang, and how the country’s most prominent families made kimchi. Most importantly, visitors are invited to sample the different varieties.  To participate in demonstrations and cooking classes, you must make a reservation at least four days prior. Check the website for more details.    The museum features a tasting room, cafe, laboratory, arts space, and a souvenir shop.  Entrance fee for adults: 5000 won, children: 3000 won. A free audioguide is available in English, Chinese, or Japanese. Museum Kimchikan is located on the 4th, 5th, and 6th floors of the Insa-dong Maru building. By Subway: Line No.1: Get off at exit No. 3 of Jonggak Station and turn around the Kumkang Shoe Building. Go straight about 650 feet on the Insa-dong street and then turn left. Line No.3: Get off at exit No. 6 of Anguk Station and go straight about 980 feet on the Insa-Dong Street and then turn right. By bus: Get off at exit No. 3 of Anguk Station, Woojungkuk Ro, and Jonggak Station."
12,Dreamy Camera Cafe,"Yangpyeong, South Korea",This quirky Korean eatery is built to resemble an equally quirky vintage camera.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dreamy-camera-cafe,"Located in a sleepy village on the outskirts of Seoul, the Dreamy Camera Cafe allows its customers to crawl inside of a giant camera and take a look through the other side of the giant lens. Built by a former pilot and avid camera collector, the cafe towers over the owner’s nearby house. Inside there are two floors of cozy coffee consumption with a decor that is dominated by vintage cameras ranging from miniature toys to real antique contraptions. Each floor has a large bay window that together, from the exterior, make up the dual lenses of the Rolleiflex camera the building is modeled after. The decor inside the cafe is equally ecstatic about photography with film negatives sitting on each coffee table, and even toilet paper that is made to look like a film reel. While the first floor of the cafe is devoted to a sort of camera museum, the second floor is home to a small gallery of photography, which patrons are welcome to try and submit their own work to. Or they can simply enjoy the rather amazing, uninterrupted view of the Korean mountains. Whether they are fans of cameras, coffee, or just stunning views, the visitors to the Dreamy Camera Cafe are well taken care of. The singular coffee house has to be one of the most picturesque structures in the world.  This charming cafe is closed on Sundays and Mondays."
13,Haesindang Park,"Samcheog, South Korea",Various forms of phallic art decorate this hill in commemoration of legendary local tragedy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/haesindang-park,"Forty minutes south of Samcheok City is Haeshindang Park, where dozens of sculpted phalluses stand erect in defiance of an old folk curse. The collection ranges from hanging arrangements to three-meter-tall trunks of wood, sculpted by Korean artists to showcase anything from joy, spirituality, to sexuality. The small Folk Museum attached showcases phallic-related art throughout the ages, as well as the history of the small fishing community. Haeshindang Park is tragic in origin. A young couple, madly in love and soon to be wed, was split by tragedy when the high tide overtook the woman in view of her fiancé on the shore. The next day, the number of fish caught dwindled. The following day, they dried up. The townspeople were said to be cursed and wondered what to do, that is, until a local fisherman relieved himself in the sea. The fish returned and men of the town took note. Thus, statues were constructed and placed in view of the shore.  From Samcheok: Take bus 24 to Sinnam (pronounced :Shinnom ). Tell the Driver HAE-SHIN-DONG and it should cost 1500 won. Takes 40 minutes, but be mindful of the large banners to know when to get off."
14,Seodaemun Prison,"Seoul, South Korea",A chilling monument to Korean patriots who resisted the Japanese occupation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/seodaemun-prison,"An anachronistic brick wall stands out amongst a rare park in one of Seoul’s quieter neighborhoods. Behind the nondescript wall, a guard tower looms, and below it, a grim gate. This gate marks the entrance to Seodaemun Prison, a relic from a forgotten era in Korea’s past steeped in subjugation and humiliation. Seodaemun Prison was opened in 1908 by occupying Japanese forces in an attempt to impose order on the newly acquired territory. Prior, the country had a virtually non-existent penal system, and the introduction of Seodaemun Prison was a precursor to full out occupation. Seodaemun became a bastion for the Korean independence movement from its opening in 1908 until the liberation of the country in 1945. As the Japanese arrested more patriots, the prison’s notoriety increased and it eventually became a symbol of perseverance. Many patriots died in custody, were tortured to death, or were executed within the prison’s walls. The macabre execution hall still stands, housing the prison’s gallows (with a tunnel nearby to dispose of corpses). Throughout the preserved prison-turned-museum, you can see chillingly recreated torture chambers, jail cells, isolation cells, and more. The women’s section has been preserved, basement cells in which no privacy was afforded. Some of the torture chambers have frighteningly realistic mannequins and effigies to famous Korean patriots who died within the prison. Designated as a historic site in 1988 and renovated in 1995, Seodaemun is an interesting place to visit for those who want a tactile experience of the Japanese occupation and the horrors entailed. It stands out amongst Seoul’s other historic sites as a monument to those who helped shape the modern Korean nation."
15,Japanese Ruins of Busan,"Busan, South Korea",The 400-year-old remains of the samurai invasion of Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/japanese-castle-ruins-of-busan,"In the late 16th century, Japanese Samurai lords, daimyos, built several castle-like fortresses in Busan during an ambitious plan to conquer Joseon Korea and Ming China. The Koreans, with the later help of the Ming emperor, used guerrilla tactics and flame-throwing armored turtle ships to expel the Japanese from the peninsula. The fortresses, however, remained. Several of the 400-year-old castle ruins can be still be seen around the southeast of Korea. They are mostly ivy and root-tangled walls and grassy baileys, situated in peaceful green parks. These ruins were once the site of some of bloody battles between the Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese forces. The Japanese invasion of Korea, or Imjin War, began in the spring of 1592 when samurai warriors and several thousand soldiers landed on Korean shores and laid siege to the city of Busan. Samurai scaled the walls of the Busanjin garrison under the cover of arquebus fire and overran the Korean defenses. After the Korean defeat, the Japanese, led by daimyo Toyotomi Hideyoshi, erected a network of Japanese-style fortresses in Korea to prepare for an assault on China. But Japan would not make it all the way to Beijing. Korean national hero admiral Yi Sun Sin harassed and weakened the Japanese resupply line with turtle ships, armored battleships with dragon-head bows that could shoot fire and cannon balls. On land, the Korean righteous army fought guerrilla warfare against the Japanese. The Ming emperor Wanli sent an army to stop the invaders as they reached and conquered Pyongyang, the modern-day capital of North Korea. The Japanese finally retreated back to Japan in 1598. History would repeat itself in 1910 when Japan invaded Korea and later Chinese Manchuria, unleashing events that would split the Korean peninsula in two and affect the whole world today. The above coordinates are for Jaseongdae park in Busanjin, site of a Japanese castle (built in 1593 and rebuilt in 1974) and the ruins of a wall fortress. Take Subway Line 1 to Beomil Station (117). Walk south from exit 2 for 3 blocks turn left (east) on Jaseonggonwon-ro. The hill can be seen behind the building on the south side of the street. There are also fortress ruins at Gupo in Deokcheon Park. Go to Deokcheon station (233) on the Busan subway line 2. From exit 10 follow Geumgok-daero Avenue north for about 4 blocks until you reach the Namhae highway overpass. The ruins will be on the hill at your right (east)."
16,Sigiriya,"Sigiriya, Sri Lanka",An ancient stone fortress considered by many to be the eighth wonder of the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sigiriya,"An ancient stone fortress used by a king of Sri Lanka as a place to build his palace and hide from his brother’s attacks, Sigiriya (The Lion Rock) is often considered the eighth wonder of the world. Situated in the central Matale District of Sri Lanka, the fortress is surrounded on all sides by the remains of an extensive network of reservoirs and gardens. These gardens are believed to be some of the oldest landscaped gardens anywhere in the world. The Lion staircase leading to the palace garden at the top of the rock is the most significant feature of this geological masterpiece. An intricate construction, the Lion staircase is a tile-covered walkway that emerges from the open mouth of the beast from which it takes its name and is built of brick and timber. The bricks surround ancient limestone steps. Named a world heritage site by UNESCO, this rock is full of archeological importance. The other primary feature that draws thousands of tourists every year is the surviving frescoes and other paintings. The few paintings that survive are the earliest examples of a Sri Lanka school of classical realism, which was fully formed by the 5th century when the paintings at Sigiriya were produced. There are also remains of paintings in some of the caves that are nestled at the foot of the giant rock. According to ancient texts, the entire rock fortress was built by King Kashyapa and, after his death, was used as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century. Today it is a popular tourist destination and one of the first places added to Sri Lanka itineraries. The climb is accessible to people of all ages and levels of fitness.  Sigiriya is situated 17km from the popular town of Dambulla. It is a relatively easy climb, but it can take up to an hour to complete due to the crowds. The main difficulty is the heat, so it is recommended to arrive early in the morning. The best time to visit Sigiriya is between January and April due to the favourable weather and to avoid monsoon season. Tickets are around US$ 30. No special dress code is required, but sensible shoes are recommended."
17,Udawalawe National Park,"Udawalawa, Sri Lanka","Huge herds of Asian elephants can be seen walking, bathing, and just chilling at this Sri Lankan park.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/udawalawe-national-park,"A grave problem facing Sri Lankan wildlife today is the human-elephant conflict, which kills up to 150 jumbos every year. Some of the baby elephants orphaned as a result of this are rehabilitated at the Elephant Transit Home, located on the fringes of the Udawalawe National Park in southern Sri Lanka. The elephant calfs are fed and sheltered during their early years, and once they reach the age of four or five, they are released back into a protected environment and monitored. The park itself is home to nearly 250 elephants, one of the highest concentrations in the country, including some young elephants released from the Transit Home.  The giant Asian elephant is the park’s biggest draw, and visitors are sure to get their fill of these and other creatures before the tour is up. Situated about a five-hour drive away from Sri Lanka’s commercial capital of Colombo, Udawalawe National Park stretches out over 30,000 hectares of grassland across the provinces of Uva and Sabaragamuwa to the island’s south. Visitors can tour through the scrublands, keeping eyes peeled for sightings of everything from wild foxes to wild boar, mongooses to macaques, water buffalos and deer of the sambar and spotted varieties. While the park is not known for playing host to big cat species such as leopards, it does feature some species of medium-sized cats like fishing and jungle cats. The park’s massive Uda Walawe Reservoir attracts a generous number of water-based birds. Some of the water bird species that are a common sight at the park are the Eurasian spoonbills, black-headed ibis, painted stork and spot-billed pelicans, as well as local bird species like the brown-capped babbler, red-faced malhoka, grey hornbill and spurfowl.  The park can be reached by using public buses or private taxis. You also have the option of making part of your journey by flight, for example from Colombo to Hambantota, and then travelling the rest of the way to the park by road. Once you get to the park, you will have to pay entrance fees to enter. Do note, that, while for Sri Lankan passport holders the fee is usually a fairly nominal amount, if you are a foreigner or a member of the Sri Lankan diaspora holding a foreign passport, you will be asked to pay a significantly higher fee."
18,Jami Ul-Alfar Masjid (Red Mosque),"Colombo, Sri Lanka",This mesmerizing architectural wonder will take your breath away with its unusual color patterns.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jami-ulalfar-masjid-red-mosque,"Sri Lanka’s Red Mosque, or Jami Ul-Alfar Masjid, is one of the architectural wonders of the world. Situated in the bustling Pettah district, one of the oldest parts of the city of Colombo, its tall minarets are seen from almost every street, towering over the hustle and bustle of the busy neighborhood streets. It is said that the Red Mosque has been a landmark for sailors approaching the port of Colombo ever since it was built in 1908, and upon looking at it you can easily imagine that being true. The mosque’s distinct red-and-white pattern, whether swirling or spiraling or alternating, is quite mesmerizing. The domes are built in the shape of pomegranate (unlike the traditional onion shape), and the colorful brick patterns are meant to convey the same image. The Red Mosque, also known as Rathu Palliya in Sinhala, and Samman Kottu Palli in Tamil, was built in what is called Indo-Saracenic style, and is reminiscent of the Jamek Mosque in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (constructed around the same time). Words cannot convey how exciting it is to see the mosque’s tall minarets and domes from the streets of Pettah, with its busy markets, shops, and bazaars. Pettah literally means “outside of the fort” and has for centuries been a trading outpost. Pettah is a curiosity, with narrow streets and shops overflowing with anything you can think of. But nothing compares with seeing this magnificent structure rising above it all. It's possible for women to enter and look around as tourists, just please note that you will need to cover your hair and arms and legs. Be respectful of religious customs if you plan to enter and enjoy this architectural wonder."
19,Adam's Peak,"Rochor, Sri Lanka","Once thought to be the Garden of Eden it holds a holy footprint claimed to belong to Adam, Buddha and Shiva.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sri-pada-adam-s-peak,"In the Middle Ages, the Garden of Eden was commonly believed to exist on earth—probably on top of a mountain, or on an island, in order to have survived Noah’s Flood. For those looking to find the exact location of the biblical garden, “East” was a popular direction to start looking in. In 1358, a Florentine monk believed he had found what he was looking for on a very tall mountain on the island of Sri Lanka. Located sixteen kilometers northeast of the city of Ratnapura, Adam’ s Peak - also known as the Samanalakanda in Sinhalese and Sivanolipatha Malai in Tamil - rises 7,360 feet above sea level, and offers an unobstructed view over land and sea. Giovanni Marignolli, who traveled the East for 15 years, declared that this particular mountain was “so close to the earthly paradise that from its top one could see paradise were it not for the cloud cover that hides it from view.” At the top, there is what looks like a fossilized footprint; Marignolli claimed it was Adam’s. The foot-shaped depression is known as the Sri Pada or “sacred footprint” and still holds religious meaning though the claim has gotten more contentious. The Hindus claim the footprint belongs to Shiva while the Buddhists claim the Sri Pada belongs to the Buddha, while Christian and Muslim Sri Lankan’s agree that the print definitely belongs to Adam’s ancient foot. The mountain has been climbed for more than a thousand years, and boasts an illustrious list of famous pilgrims including the Arab traveler Ibn Batuta, and possibly, Alexander the Great. It remains a major shrine site and hiking trail today."
20,Shark Point Reef,Sri Lanka,One of the few places where inexperienced snorkelers can spot a shark.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shark-point-reef,"Snorkelling on the coral reefs at Pigeon Island National Park  is absolutely fantastic wherever you are on the islands. But the main attraction is the island’s many juvenile and adult blacktip reef sharks. These sharks are up to five feet long and are reliably seen in an area next to the larger of the two islands, known as Shark Point Reef. This nonaggressive species seems to be quite accepting of humans in the water, and snorkelers have an almost guaranteed opportunity to see them—sometimes as close as a couple meters away in water as shallow as a meter deep. It is one of the few places where totally inexperienced snorkelers can have as good a chance of a shark encounter as fully qualified scuba divers. Pigeon Island National Park actually consists of two islands: large and small. It is a marine national park in Sri Lanka located in the general area of the city of Trincomalee and contains some of the best remaining coral reefs of Sri Lanka. Many of the 100 species of corals and 300 coral reef fishes recorded around the area are found in this national park. The coral reef is visited by Hawkesbill Turtle, Green Turtle and Olive Ridley Turtle and the island is important breeding ground for the rock pigeon. The area was badly affected by the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004 but has now largely recovered. The map pin shows the best place to enter the water to see the sharks. The best conditions for snorkelling or diving on this side of Sri Lanka is from late March to Late October. The Sri Lanka Navy runs a holiday resort for navy personnel families on Nillaveli beach and runs its own  boats out to the island which makes it quite busy at times The nearest town is the tourist town Nillaveli. The national park is situated about 1000 meters off Nillaveli Beach. From here you can take a motor boat out to the island. The boat fee usually includes the entry fee to the national park. Whilst neither are cheap  it is certainly good value."
21,Brief Garden,"Kirantidiya, Sri Lanka","This luscious masterpiece created by landscape designer Bevis Bawa inspired the work of his brother, a famous Sri Lankan architect.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brief-garden,"Plants spill down the sides of the house, blanketing it in a layer of lush greenery. Stems sprout from sculpted pots, while elsewhere pink flowers erupt into a dazzling, colorful display. It’s an enchanting place, one where its creator’s personality and love for the landscape come alive. Brief Garden is the masterpiece of Bevis Bawa, brother of the famous Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa. Bevis, the elder Bawa brother, began crafting this luscious landscape roughly 20 years before Geoffrey commenced work on his world-famous Lunuganga Estate. Bevis created the garden by spending decades transforming the rubber plantation he inherited into the verdant jungle-esque gem it is today. He began cultivating the space in the late 1920s while serving in the army and continued up until he died at age 89 in 1992. Thankfully, the estate is still maintained and open to the public. It errs on the wild side for a garden, with tangles of vines creeping down the walls of the buildings. It has an intimate atmosphere, making you feel as though you’ve left the town behind and stepped into your own secluded slice of the jungle. Narrow paths wind through tropical plants, revealing a pool, patio, and staircase. Archways cloaked in greenery lead to hidden statues like carved faces and a stoic horse tucked among the flora. The house, too, is worth a peek. The art within it and the garden reflect Bevis’ personality and life. Homoerotic sculptures dot the space, and a stunning mural depicting Sri Lankan life adorns one of the walls. If you’re in Colombo, you can easily arrive at the Brief Garden within two hours' drive. One has to buy a ticket to get in, but it’s nothing too expensive, and the tour lasts about an hour and a half and is definitely an experience you won’t soon forget. The antique sculptures are prohibited from being interacted with so children should always be accompanied by adults. One should also dress light since the weather is fairly tropical, and carry an umbrella since rain is also quite common."
22,Helga's Folly,"Kandy, Sri Lanka","A Bohemian ""anti-hotel"" offers off-kilter stays in Sri Lanka.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/helga-s-folly,"Even hotels which are considered “off the beaten path” generally offer a standard lodging experience, but Sri Lanka’s Helga’s Folly presents a junkman’s paradise of faded luxury. A meandering crimson mansion nestled in the Sri Lankan jungle, the home of eccentric proprietor Helga de Silva Blow Perera has been turned into an overstuffed hotel full of knick-knacks and memories. After inheriting the property from her parents, de Silva turned her former home, full of sumptuous pillows, beds, and couches, into an intimate traveling destination. Visitors can rent a room for the night and relax among the house’s many rich parlors surrounded by walls covered in every manner of decoration from taxidermy to the countless picture frames displaying old press clippings of Hollywood gone by. The Folly takes great pride from its former celebrity lodgers including Laurence Olivier and Vivian Leigh who once had a very public feud around the location. This kitschy kingdom is maybe the last thing one would expect to find in the jungles of Sri Lanka, but somehow Helga’s Folly seems right at home."
23,Saint Anthony’s Church and Cemetery,Sri Lanka,The ruins of this old church are slowing sinking into the sand.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saint-anthonys-church-and-cemetery,"On the far northeastern beaches of Sri Lanka there is a tiny village called Manalkadu. It doesn’t see many tourists—and with only one battered unnamed road to get there, that’s not surprising. What is surprising, once you do arrive, is finding the ruins of a once-majestic church, and a collection of modest graves nearby, watching as the walls are slowly eaten by sand. The church is the old St. Anthony’s, but exactly how old is a little murky. Some accounts date it to the 17th century, during the period of Dutch rule. Others put the date around 1900, when Sri Lanka was the British colony known as Ceylon. Whatever the age, the effect of the stone, brick and coral walls slowly sinking into the dunes provides an eerie and striking backdrop to the modest cross markers that dot the sand, and the deep blue Indian Ocean just beyond. The crosses are the graves of local residents, many of whom were among the thousands of Sri Lankans who lost their lives in the 2004 tsunami. As with the church walls, the dunes around the graves are always shifting, the sand revealing either too much or too little of what’s buried below. The history of Sri Lanka goes back at least 3,000 years, to the days of the ancient Silk Road. Until 2014 it was difficult to get a visa to visit the area of the old St. Anthony’s, but tourism has since opened up as the political and economic conditions in Sri Lanka have improved. The sands, always shifting. The ruins and cemetery are along the beach just north of the small village of Manalkadu, about 6 miles from the town of Point Pedro. It is on the Jaffna peninsula at the very northern tip of the island. Many of the area roads are unnamed, so you can set your GPS to the coordinates up top. Note that there is a new, rebuilt St. Anthony’s in the village, not to be confused with the ruins. Also, there are reports from some tour sites that the beaches around Manalkuda are patrolled by the army. Check with local tourism authorities or agencies as to current access and any restrictions for visitors."
24,Pettah Floating Market,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Pettah's beautiful floating market was once a stinky canal in a sketchy industrial area.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pettah-floating-market,"The Pettah Floating Market is a recent development in Bastian Mawatha, which lives in the Pettah neighborhood of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Now a calm spot for shopping and a quiet stroll, it was once a chaotic canal-side area of rundown warehouses, stinky water, and dubious characters involved in equally questionable activities. In the 1990s, the area now occupied by the floating market was one of the most dangerous zones in Pettah. Dilapidated buildings and abandoned factories lined the old colonial canal side, and pushy hawkers, drug dealers, and other nefarious types had turned the area into a place most people tried to avoid. In the last few years, as Colombo began a series of ambitious beautification projects, this part of Pettah was a prime target for redevelopment. The local council brought in the Urban Development Authority (UDA) to tidy up the area, who in turn contacted the Ministry of Defense for assistance. Engineering units were brought in from the Sri Lanka Army and Sri Lanka Navy, who began to redevelop this part of Bastian Mawatha. Looking to transform the area, the UDA then called on a young architect named Thushari Kariyawasam. His vision led to today’s floating market, an oasis of calm in busy Colombo, with smooth cement paths and polished wooden walkways running along and over the widened—and cleaned—canal. Along these walkways are a series of red-roofed pagodas, in which more than 90 stalls have been allocated to local street vendors, many of whom were uprooted during this and other developments, but who were allowed to move back into the new stalls. They had to pay rent, unlike before, and some, unfortunately, didn’t last for long—but those that remained have found a far more relaxed way of making a living. The stalls sell a wide range of products, including electronics, clothes, shoes, jewelry, local handicrafts, fruit, and vegetables. Some are also snack bars selling local specialties to hungry tourists and amorous locals out for romantic sunset strolls along the walkways. The redevelopment project hasn’t been a total success. Traders still complain about high rent and low sales, and stalls often remain shut for long periods of time. Some visitors, meanwhile, are somewhat put off by the occasionally smelly water, which can become overly malodorous especially during the heat of the summer. Still, it’s a fine place for a quiet wander, some casual shopping, and pretty photos at sunset.  You don't have to pay to enter the Pettah Floating Market. There are entrances at the west and east ends; the main entrance is on the west side, but either will do. It's open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. To get there, take a bus to Pettah Bus Station or Bastian Mawatha Bus Station. For the best photos, head to the market around 5 p.m. to catch the golden hour."
25,Fa-Hien Lena (Pahiyangala Cave),"Gavaragiriya, Sri Lanka","The remains of a 37,000-year-old prehistoric society were discovered in this mammoth cave, one of the largest in Asia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pahiyangala-caves-sri-lanka,"Located in the village of Yatagampitiya in Sri Lanka, Fa-Hien Lena (also known as Pahiyangala Cave) is the largest cave on the island, and one of the largest natural rock formations in all of Asia. The cave was also the site of a remarkable archaeological discovery that dug up human skulls dating back about 37,000 years—the remains of one of the region’s oldest prehistoric human settlements. Surrounded by tropical greens, the mammoth cave measures 200 feet long, with an entrance 175 feet high and 160 feet wide, and sits 400 feet above sea level. There are areas inside the cave which are over 400 feet high. As archaeological research is still being conducted, many of the cave’s natural tunnels have been blocked. Aside from research, the cave is also the home of a Buddhist temple. A local monk used a heavy stone tool to clear the cave entrance and level the ground. Visitors to the cave are greeted by the temple’s 40 foot long reclining Buddha statue. Beyond the cave’s natural beauty, the archaeological finds within it make it a remarkable piece of history. In addition to the human skulls the Sri Lankan Archaeological Departments found, they also discovered weapons from the same era. These weapons, made from animal bones and stones, were used to kill deer, monkeys, porcupines, and other animals. According to researchers, evidence found in the cave suggests that these early humans also ate “a few types of edible snails and wild breadfruit.” Researchers have also discovered that after eating the snails, the cave’s earliest residents would pierce their shells to make jewelry. Getting to the cave can be a bit of a struggle, with about a 20 minute walk up stone steps (without a railing), but it’s a popular spot for school trips and picnickers.  A long walk and semi-strenuous climb is required to visit the Pahiyangala Cave, but compared to the other historic sites in Sri Lanka, the climb and walk, in this case, is minimal. Located about 40km away from Colombo, this is a close site and is an easy drive too. The place is accessible from Kalutara and Horana and when you take the Piliyandala Bulathsinghala Road and pass the rice fields and villages, you’ll find yourself at the stony path that leads up to the cave’s entrance. The steps in the path are cemented, but you’d find natural stone steps in between, and they must be stepped on carefully as they have jagged edges and can cause discomfort if stomped on. The excavation pit is open to visitors, and if you’re curious, you can walk down the stairs and into the pit and take a look at the digs with your own eyes. Within the cave, you’d find an ancient door that leads you into the bat cave, not like DC, but real bats that can hit you in the face when they fly out, so step in with care!"
26,The Main Line,"Nanuoya, Sri Lanka","Known as the most scenic route in Sri Lanka, this train line is steeped in history and offers an unparalleled view of the country.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-main-line,"The Main Line was the name given to this railway line by the British who are often credited with its construction beginning around 1874. It was the first major line constructed on the island and was originally designed to link tea growing estates in the mountains to the port at Colombo. However, while the desire to build the railroad came from the British, many of its key elements were constructed and designed by a group of talented local engineers. This fantastic railway line runs from Colombo Fort station to Badulla, some 182 miles to the east. It passes through both natural and cultivated countrysides, which include quite a few tea plantations. The breathtaking views and natural beauty are complemented by the train’s journey through various towns and villages. Even express trains along this line only travel at about 15 mph through the winding mountain terrain, allowing for passengers to soak in their surroundings. One of the more unique features along the line is the Demodara Railway Loop. This is a junction where the track spirals sharply, passing over itself to gain height in a short distance. Such configurations are not uncommon on railways in mountainous regions, but what makes this one so unique is the station that sits directly over the tunnel, allowing the line to cross itself. It’s said that the engineer who designed the loop was inspired by watching a man tie and retie his Talappawa. There is a famous train service along the Main Line called the Blue Train, which runs from Kandy to Ella. It’s a very popular trip among tourists due to the modern carriages and air-conditioned first class. The trains themselves are Chinese built, diesel multiple units, with a power car and driving cab at each end. However, the intercity services, which run all the way to and from Colombo Fort Station, are hauled by traditional diesel locomotives and include a much more diverse range of coaches. The second and third class coaches have opening windows and provide better views than first-class, making for better photo ops. Many of the trains also include a special observation car at the rear. It’s arguably the best way to experience the journey; with a marvelous view along the backend of the tracks. One of the most well-used stations is Nanu Oya, which is the closest one to the mountain resort of Nuwara Eliya. It was here that British colonials decamped during the hot summer months.  The coordinates are for Nanu Oya station which is the 63rd station on the line from Colombo Fort. When getting off at Colombo Fort, hold onto your ticket until well outside the station, checkpoints seem to be numerous and random. You need to book the train a couple of days in advance to ensure you get the seat of your choice. Buying tickets on the day is cheaper, but with a 5-6 hour journey in first class, including advanced booking, at about £5, the cost is not really an issue. If you have the time, a return route from Nanu Oya to Kandy by road (two buses per hour but a 4-5 hour trip, some are air-conditioned) will take you past some spectacular scenery you don't see on the train and is worth the extra time."
27,Buduruwagala,"Buduruwagala, Sri Lanka","Seven beautiful 1,000-year-old rock-cut Buddhist statues.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buduruwagala,"Buduruwagala is a rock temple dating back to the ninth or 10th century. It consists of seven ancient Buddhist figures carved into the face of a large cliff. The largest measures 51 feet high, making it the tallest Buddha statue in Sri Lanka. The giant Buddha figure is situated at the center of the cliff face, flanked by three smaller statues on both sides. On the right are depictions of the Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, the Goddess Tara, and Prince Sudhana; on the left are Maitree Bodhisattva, and Vajrapani Bodhisattva. These are figures from the Mahayana tradition of Buddhism. A faint orange hue is visible on the tallest statue, suggesting that the carvings were probably painted originally. Several square niches are carved into the rock above the statues; their use is not known. By the right foot of the Buddha is a 4-foot-high hole shaped like a flame. The deepest reaches of this hole are always wet with a substance that smells like mustard oil. It is speculated that Buduruwagala (which roughly translates to “rock with Buddha statues”) was a hermitage site for Mahayana Buddhist monks, but no information other than the approximate age of the carvings has come to light so far. These days, a modern building houses a small number of monks that reside here.  Buduruwagala can be reached from either Wellawaya or Thanamalwila. The last 2.5 miles (4 km) are on a dirt track through a set of lakes, home to egrets and herons."
28,Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic,"Kandy, Sri Lanka",This elaborate temple was built around one of the Buddha's teeth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/temple-of-the-tooth,"Located in the appropriately-named-to-Western-ears town of Kandy in Sri Lanka, the Temple of the Tooth offers some sweet Eastern architecture surrounding a religious relic. According to local tradition, the Buddha’s tooth was given to the Sri Lankan monarchy in ancient times. Whoever holds the relic is said to hold the governance of the country. The tooth was passed around through various kings and holy men who hid, moved, and relocated the sacred relic across centuries. Now the tooth is housed in a dedicated temple inside the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy. Worshipers can visit the relic, which is held in a golden stupa inside the two-story shrine. The relic is encased in seven golden caskets which are engraved and inlaid with precious gemstones. Although parts of the shrine were destroyed and rebuilt over the years in various bombings and acts of war, the building still retains its opulent style of gold and moonstone, surrounded by Buddhist carvings and offerings. This piece of peace may be small, but the Temple of the Tooth makes it seem as important as the Buddha himself."
29,Adam's Bridge,"Mannar, Sri Lanka","According to Hindu belief, this shallow island chain was created by a god with an army of monkeys.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/adams-bridge,"Sri Lanka is an island, or at least that’s what they want you to think. The 18-mile gap between it and India is filled with shoals and sandbanks, that religious tradition holds are the remains of a bridge built by Rama, an avatar of Vishnu. And actually, some scientists now believe that the clerics might have a point. A thin strand of shoals, some only feet below the sea, stretch from India to Sri Lanka. The British Empire made a sort of steampunk Chunnel, going from rail to steamship, a century ago. Plans to blast open the rocks for shipping have run aground on something unexpected: religious Hindus who believe Adam’s Bridge to be a relic from the Ramayana epic. The story goes that Rama set an army of monkeys to work building a bridge to the island redoubt of the demon king Ravana. It may sound far-fetched to secular ears, but there are records from as late as the Medieval era that describe an international walking path. India’s ruling party has refused to permit construction of the shipping channel. Satellite imagery is undeniable; a filament connects the landmasses just under the surface. Photographs or videos aren’t enough to make any case closed. Religion or obstruction, history or myth, it’s in the eye of the analyst, but the underwater land link is definitely there. Plenty of tour agencies have taken advantage of the barely submerged islands, putting the rocky outcroppings on the “Rama Trail” of Sri Lanka’s Hindu legacy. A traveler could do that, or perhaps rent out a private boat. They wouldn’t see anything that hasn’t been argued about online. But at least a traveler could see it for himself."
30,Wewurukannala Vihara,"Dikwella, Sri Lanka","To gaze upon the visage of Sri Lanka's biggest Buddha, one must first pass through the Tunnel of Hell.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wewurukannala-vihara,"Wewurukannala Vihara is most famous for a gargantuan seated Buddha waiting to greet devout pilgrims, but the temple’s most wonderfully unexpected (and unsettling) feature lies somewhere along the way. The temple is divided into three parts, the oldest of which dates back to the 18th-century reign of King Rajadhi and has a more modest Buddha worked into the structure’s outward-facing architecture. The second element, the giant Buddha statue, was constructed in the 1960s when a penchant for larger-than-life roadside attractions took the world by storm. At 160 feet tall, it literally and figuratively rises above the quagmires of earthly life. Which leads to the third, most overlooked, aspect of Wewurukannala Vihara: in order to meet the big Buddha up-close, visitors must first navigate the Tunnel of Hell. Down in the tunnel, life-sized models illustrate what will happen should one succumb to all those earthly temptations lining the path to enlightement. It is Buddhist Hell made tangible, played out in cartoonish horror before visitors’ eyes. Highlights include immersion in boiling cauldrons, disembowelment, and sinners being hacked to pieces by human-like demons with fangs. The end result is a visit to Wewurukannala Vihara and its message reads as strikingly one in the same: Don’t stop in the middle, for a serene paradise awaits just on the other side. At the town of Dikwella, 22km from Matara, a road turns inland towards Beliatta. The temple is approximately 1.5km down the road."
31,Koneswaram Temple,"Trincomalee, Sri Lanka",An ancient temple to the Hindu god Shiva surrounded by jaw-dropping scenery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koneswaram-temple,"On a spectacular promontory overlooking one of the world’s largest natural harbours, there is an ancient temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. It is at the head of Konesar Malai (Swami Rock) on the dramatic Gokarna Bay, a seasonal home to blue whales. Surrounded by jaw-dropping scenery on all sides, the colourful Koneswaram temple sits high above the bay, a classical-medieval complex in the Eastern Province city of Trincomalee. The site is a religious pilgrim centre, and is one of the five “Pancha Ishwarams” (abodes of Shiva) that were built in coastal regions of Sri Lanka to honor the supreme god of Hinduism. The dates of the temple have been debated, with some scholars citing the original to around 400 BC, and later construction from as early as the 5th century to as late as the 18th. At one time the complex was as large and grand as any in India or Sri Lanka. The grandeur was mostly lost in the 17th century at the hands of the colonial Portuguese, who razed structures, dumped some into the sea, destroyed objects, and smashed ornamentation. To salvage what they could, priests and devotees of the temple scrambled to bury their sacred objects, even taking advantage of the sea itself rather than seeing them crushed in the raid. The original temple is claimed by some to have been the greatest building of its age, for both its architecture and its ornamentation. It combined key features to form a typically southern Indian plan, such as a thousand-pillared hall (similar to the famous “Aayiram Kaal Mandapam” in Madurai, India) and raised platform (or “jagati”) configuration, features that had been destroyed. It was said that its gopuram (gateway tower) was visible to sailors approaching Sri Lanka from the sea. The evidence for this magnificence comes from unearthing the very remnants that were buried, as well as the discovery of key pieces at the bottom of the bay. They were found by photographer Mike Wilson and science-fiction author, Arthur C. Clarke. In 1956, Wilson and Clarke uncovered masonry, idol images, carved columns with flower insignias, and elephant head carvings while scuba-diving. More importantly, they also retrieved the legendary Swayambhu lingam;  a large stone phallus / obelisk said to originate from a Tibetan mountain top. Upon reinstalling the lingam to the temple, Wilson was so overwhelmed by the experience that he renounced his career and family to become a Hindu swami. As well as the recovered underwater pieces, there are also some original drawings done by Constantino de Sá de Noronha, the Portuguese governor responsible for the destruction. Restoration work was completed in 1963 with the old pieces reinstalled. Today the site is reborn, and there is some quite modern construction as well. And while the current site does not match up to the pre-1624 temple, it is still an awe-inspiring place to visit, for Hindus and non-Hindus alike.  The temple is on the northeastern coast of Sri Lanka, at the very end of Konesar Road. Continue past Fort Frederick (currently an army base, and formerly a British colonial fort) and follow the path lined with shops. You’ll walk through various courtyard shrines, eventually reaching the giant statue of Shiva at the promontory. The temple requests all visitors to please respect the religious customs and propriety, including appropriate dress. Be prepared to remove your shoes."
32,Wanli UFO Village,"New Taipei City, Taiwan",A rare pod of derelict midcentury Futuro and Venturo houses lines a semi-abandoned beachfront resort outside Taipei.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wanli-ufo-village,"Mystery surrounds this semi-abandoned holiday resort, home to the last pod of Futuro—a.k.a “UFO”—houses in Taiwan, as well as what may be the largest pod of Venturo houses in the world. The eerie streets of this abandoned beachside paradise still echo with the cries of surfers fighting against the strong coastal waves from the village’s bygone days as a hub of midcentury futurism. The Futuro houses, designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, resemble whimsical flying saucers. The pre-fabricated plastic oddities were originally designed as ski chalets light enough to be airlifted onto any terrain, although the ones at Wanli swapped the adjustable UFO-style legs for tacky ’70s-era pebble-concrete staircases. The UFO-shaped house closest to the entrance of the park boasts a fully functioning airplane-style door and windows; inside the small circular space are a sitting area, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. (Other Futuros farther into the park have been less well-preserved, although one nearly hidden example seems to be in continuous occupation as part of a much larger building.) This particular pod, comprising about six Futuros, is scattered throughout a large complex of Venturo Houses, another retrofuturistic pre-fab house model by the same architect. Unlike the Futuro, the Venturo never really took off in its own era, and hasn’t experienced the same resurgence of popular interest. Reportedly less than 10 “true” Venturos exist in the world—but there are more than 10 in this park alone! That’s where the mystery comes in: These dwellings do not appear to have been sanctioned by Suuronen himself, and there doesn’t seem to be any publicly accessible information as to where they came from, or even exactly when they were built."
33,Rainbow Family Village,"Taichung City, Taiwan","Grandpa Rainbow felt the neighborhood needed some color, so he picked up a paintbrush and went to work.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rainbow-family-village,"Three years ago an 87 year-old military veteran known as “Grandpa Rainbow” (real name is Huang Yung-Fu) began painting the walls, doors, and ground of his small military dependents’ village, just outside of Taichung in Taiwan. Every day Grandpa Rainbow paints a little more and more, bringing the village’s rundown surfaces back to life with his vibrant colors and characters, and giving it the name “Rainbow Family Village”. Depending on whom you are talking to, Grandpa Rainbow either started painting because he was bored and wanted to brighten up his drab surroundings, or it was to save his village from demolition by the government. No matter the backstory, the village has become something of an out-of-the-way tourist destination. Grandpa Rainbow is now the only person living in the village, and despite the draw, Rainbow Family Village is currently under threat of demolition to make way for new development."
34,Houtong Cat Village,"New Taipei City, Taiwan","Once a prosperous mining village, this tiny Taiwanese town is now overrun with cute cats.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/houtong-cat-village,"At one point, the Taiwanese village of Houtong was one of the largest providers of coal in the country, but as the population declined and the town threatened to disappear, it was saved from the brink by an influx of lovable felines. During its height, Houtong encompassed around 900 households, fostering a population of around 6,000 people. Yet by the 1970s the town’s fortunes began to fall into decline. As is often the case in such situations, the younger residents of the town quickly began leaving for greener pastures and opportunities in the bigger cities. By the 1990s, the mining industry had died off in the area completely, and the population of the village had dwindled to less than 100 people. Most villages in this situation would have simply fallen off the face of the Earth, but luckily for Houtong, it received a little feline salvation. By 2008, the tiny village had accumulated dozens of stray cats that nearly outnumbered the humans. Seeing this as an opportunity to inject a little life into their town, the human inhabitants began advertising themselves on the internet as a cat-friendly sanctuary, where visitors could come and commiserate with the meowing mousers that had control of the streets. The image stuck, and today Houtong is a fairly popular tourist destination that sees people train in from all over to see the cats (now numbering over 100) that freely roam the area. Shops selling cat paraphernalia and the like have sprung up, but the true draw is still the beasts themselves.    From Taipei Main Train Station, take the TRA to Rui Fang Station, then change train to go to Houtong Station."
35,The Dome of Light,"Xinxing District, Taiwan",The world’s largest work of glass art hides in this stunning Taiwanese subway station.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-dome-of-light-xinxing-district-taiwan,"At the intersection of Kaohsiung’s Red and Orange metro lines, the history of the universe plays out on giant dome of illuminated glass. Built by Italian artist Narcissus Quagliata, the Dome of Light also commemorates the harrowing birth of Taiwan’s democracy. Despite its location at Kaohsiung’s busiest metro stop, the Dome of Light holds the solemnity of a cathedral. The dome is an impressive 30 meters (98 feet) in diameter and is made of 4,500 glass panels, making it the largest work of glass art in the world. The installation took Quagliata four and a half years to complete and has led some to call Formosa Boulevard one of the world’s most beautiful subway stations. Each of the dome’s four quadrants highlights themes from the lifecycle of the cosmos, humanity, and Taiwan’s own tumultuous political history. The imagery moves through periods of painful growth and inevitable destruction, but the overall message echoes with hope and rebirth. Although Taiwan is now considered one of the most legitimate democracies in Asia (second only to Japan and South Korea), its political history is defined by violence and oppression under a one-party state. Beginning with the February 28 massacre in 1947, a 38-year period of martial law saw tens of thousands of political dissidents imprisoned or executed. Things began to shift on December 10, 1979, when a pro-democracy demonstration and celebration of Human Rights Day descended into police-instigated violence. The events of the protest helped unite government opposition and marked a turning point in Taiwan’s democratization. Known as the Formosa Incident, the protests took place near the present-day Formosa Boulevard Station where the Dome of Light is installed. At street level, the Formosa Boulevard Station is just as remarkable. The four main entrances were designed by Japanese architect Shin Takamatsu. Their curved shape and orientation towards one another is thought to be symbolic of hands clasped in prayer—perhaps seeking redemption for the past or wishing for continued peace in the future. The Dome of Light can be found in the B1 level of the Formosa Boulevard Station, where the Kaohsiung MRT Red Line and Orange Line intersect."

Once the land of the indigenous Truko people, in whose language Taroko means “magnificent and beautiful,” the land was recreated as a national park by the Taiwanese government in 1986. Driven out by the Japanese in 1914, today the only remains of the Truko people in Taroko National park are the ruins of the 120-year-old Tupido Tribe Trail on the Tianhsyang mesa. The picturesque Eternal Spring Shrine has been rebuilt twice following landslides, and remembers the 212 who died during the construction of the Central Cross-Island Highway. The Tunnel of Nine Turns follows a particularly dramatic series of tight turns along the narrow gorge. Another long, unlit tunnel known as the Baiyang Waterfall Trail allows hikers willing to brave the dark some extraordinary views of sheet waterfalls at the far end. An annual international marathon is run at Taroko National Park each year in November."

Named after the waterfall that runs beneath it year round, the beautiful little temple was built in the late 1950s while the nearby Cross-Island Highway was still under construction. The road was built by Taiwanese veterans and tragically over 200 of them perished during the effort. These brave workers are remembered by a small temple and adjoining pavilion that are connected by the bridge spanning the titular falls, all of which makes up the shrine complex. Visitors to the shrine who are willing to do a little exploring will find a number of wonders hidden behind the shrine as well including a cave with statues of a handful of Taoist gods, and trails leading to more secluded towers and sites hidden among the natural features. The shrine has been damaged and nearly destroyed a couple of times due to landslides on its verdant mountainside, but each time, the site has been rebuilt and continues to stand as a beautiful monument to the human cost of progress.

38,Yehliu Geopark,"Yehliu, Taiwan",This Taiwanese promontory is covered in otherworldly hoodoo formations.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yehliu-geopark,"Wind, water, time, and tourism have worked to create a rocky alien landscape in Taiwan, known today as the Yehliu Geopark. Stabbing out into the East China Sea, the thin spit of land now known as a “geopark” is awash in all manner of sculpted rock formations. The most well-known shapes are the top-heavy hoodoos that act as the symbol of the park, but there are a wide variety of shapes that have been etched into the land across the centuries. The unique landscape is the result of wind and waves crashing over the thin spike of earth, coming from the sea on almost every side. Many of these natural stone forms have even been given fanciful pet names like the oft-photographed, “Queen’s Head.” In the park you can also find formations called the “The Fairy Shoe,” and “The Sea Candles.” In addition the to the stunning geological wonders in the geopark, the other increasingly common sight are the throngs of tourists that have begun flocking to the site. Unfortunately, like the wind and water that shaped the bulbous vistas, the very presence of so many humans is beginning to shape the land as well. Popular sites like the “Queen’s Head” have become so overrun that bright lines have been painted on the ground to keep anyone from disturbing the delicate rocks. The rocks took centuries to form, but could be forever changed in an instant, with our interference."
39,Tuned Mass Damper of Taipei 101,"Taipei City, Taiwan",Enormous pendulum helps keep Taiwan's tallest building from swaying.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tuned-mass-damper-of-taipei-101,"Inside the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taiwan is the world’s largest and heaviest tuned mass damper. Essentially acting as a giant pendulum, the enormous steel sphere moves slightly back and forth to counter any motion of the building itself. It is an engineering marvel meant to limit the vibrations of the 1,667-foot tall building. The 18-foot diameter, 660- metric ton steel sphere is suspended by eight cables in the upper stories of the tower, and is visible between the 88th and 92nd floors. The Taipei 101 Tuned Mass Damping were built and tested by A&H Custom Machine. The fabrication of the components took approximately a year to complete. As one of the tallest structures in the world, located only 660 feet from a major fault line, earthquakes and high winds are a serious threat. In fact, visitors even caught a glimpse of the tuned mass damper in action during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Many skyscrapers contain tuned mass dampers to restrain sway, and as the tops of the tallest buildings can move several feet in the wind, a tuned mass damper or similar mechanism is often necessary for maintaining structural integrity. At Taipei 101, the room-sized device is capable of moving five feet in any direction, thereby reducing sway by 30 to 40 percent. Safety comes at a hefty price, however, as the tower’s tuned mass damper cost $4 million to build.  Take elevator from 5th floor to 89th floor"
40,The High Heel Church,"Budai Township, Taiwan",Visit this church that's shaped like a giant glass pump either to cater to women or to reference a tragic local tale. Or both.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-high-heel-church-budai-township-taiwan,"Standing on a large concrete disc in Ocean View Park, in Taiwan’s Budai township, is a massive glass slipper that looks as though it would be fit for a giant Cinderella. In actuality this strange building is a church meant to cater to women. Or to reference a local legend. Or something. Finished in early 2016, the giant shoe church is an all-glass structure, formed out of 320 blue-tinted panes, set into a metal grid. The main worship space is held in the toe with a large screen at the tip, while there is an outdoor stage built into the collar where someone’s giant foot might go. While it is being called a church, officials say that its main function will be to cater to weddings and photo shoots. In addition to its questionably female-centric architecture, the interior of the worship shoe is said to include over 100 features that women will like, including love seat benches, biscuits and cakes, and maple leaf decorations. Before anyone gets to thinking that all of this is just to pander to women, there is a second, more traditional  reasoning behind the design of the church. Apparently it is actually an allusion to a local story of a girl who caught Blackfoot. As the story goes, this local girl contracted the disease and had to have the lower portions of her legs amputated, ending her engagement, and resulting in her spending the rest of her days alone and living in a church. Jesus. (Pun intended.) Whether the high heel shoe church is meant to be an outdated clarion call to women, via their stereotypical love of shoes, or a huge monument to a tragic tale, it is certainly something to behold."

Located in the southwest of Lotus Lake and completed in 1953 just two years after the man-made lake itself, the Spring and Autumn Pavilions are a pair of traditionally ornate palace towers that are separated by large dragon being ridden by a god. The two massive pavilions are dedicated to a God of War, known (among many other spellings) as Kuan Kung. The two devotional buildings are separated by a giant dragon statue that itself has the statue of a large figure on its back. This was inspired by the tale of the Goddess of Mercy, Kuanyin, riding a dragon through the sky, symbolically separating Spring and Autumn. Visitors can enter the pavilions through the dragon’s mouth. A ways south of the pavilions along the lakeshore are the much taller Dragon and Tiger Pagodas which were completed in 1978. This twin-spired temple consists of a duo of seven-story pagoda towers which are attended by giant versions of their respective beast. The interior of the towers are decked out in traditional finery with two spiral staircases each, one for ascending devotees and one for those descending. Both the giant dragon and the giant tiger have their mouths open and visitors enter the temple spaces by being devoured.  By Railway: Take the THSR or TRA train to Zuoying Station, walk about 10 mins. By MRT: Take MRT Red Line and get off at Ecological District Station, continue by the Bus Red 51 to Lotus Lake stop from Ecological District Station Exit No. 2."

The exterior of the restaurant belies the efforts inside to simulate the dense streetscape one might have found in 1940s through 1970s Taiwan. Arrayed around the perimeter of the dining tables are various replica storefronts, including a dentist’s office, a general store, and a ticket booth for a movie theater. Nostalgia’s the order of the day here: Notices and ads from the time period cover every wall and simulated telephone pole, while servers dress in the uniforms and bright orange hats worn by primary school students of the time. Private dining rooms can be found upstairs (also appropriately themed after schoolrooms), but the second floor serves as a museum in its own right, with display after display of collected toys, dishware, and other assorted paraphernalia.

44,Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village,"Yuchi Township, Taiwan",This attraction is part anthropological journey and part amusement park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/formosan-aboriginal-culture-village,"Since the 1980s, Taiwan’s Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village has been educating visitors about the history and customs of the country’s Indigenous tribes. But even more recently the park has branched out into teaching guests about how awesome roller coasters can be. Originally built in 1986, the culture park stands as Taiwan’s largest outdoor museum, consisting of nine separate village reconstructions and a traditional European garden. Each of the villages was meant to represent a different tribal culture from the area and were created based on ethnographic illustrations from the early 20th century. In addition to the traditional architectural flourishes throughout the park, traditional dances, crafts, and other authentic demonstrations are regularly performed. Notably, all of the performers in the park are Indigenous people. The Taiwanese government currently recognizes 16 aboriginal tribes. Years of conflict and colonization have greatly reduced the country’s Indigenous population and culture–out of 26 known Formosan languages, 10 have been declared extinct, while the remaining languages are in danger of disappearing completely. Lest the exploration of a rich and varied culture that may soon fade from memory in the coming century become a bit stale or boring for younger visitors, a new section of the park was built in 1992, called Amusement Isle. Maintaining the cultural flavor of the more educational portions of the park, the exciting new isle contains a collection of roller coasters and adrenaline engines including Taiwan’s tallest free-fall drop ride. Whether you are coming to the park to see the blooming of the cherry blossom trees and learn some of the aboriginal weaving techniques, or if you simply want to scream while the wind whips through your hair on the Mayan Adventure Roller Coaster, the Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village, oddly enough, will not disappoint."

Not only is the region the birthplace of boba tea; with wider spaces and cheaper rent, there’s more freedom for native aboriginal tribes like the Paiwan to run places like Gulu Gulu. Discreetly tucked inside Taichung’s West District, the restaurant’s name is meant to mimic the sound a hungry stomach, and should your belly “growl,” Gulu Gulu is the place to satiate it. Beyond a fascinating DIY arts-and-crafts folk garden, the small restaurant is decorated with colorful paper flags, painted rocks, and vibrant handmade table settings. There’s also a dog roaming around. His master is the one-man staff who serves up a clever mix of flavorful vegetarian-friendly fare with dishes that feature the ubiquitous Taiwanese meat-dish: pork. Don’t be surprised when that same server busts out his guitar to sing a few traditional aboriginal songs live, too. He’s a one-man show, but he’s good."
46,Anping Tree House,"Tainan City, Taiwan",The tangled roots of a giant banyan tree have fully reclaimed the ruins of this abandoned warehouse.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/anping-tree-house,"This abandoned merchant warehouse complex in Tainan’s Anping District was originally built in the 19th century by the British Tait & Co trading company, which is evident in the Western colonial architecture that is still just barely visible at the front of the overgrown site. Nowadays, the place has taken on a new purpose altogether, thanks to the spectacle of the Anping Tree House that is tucked around the back. For a few dollars, you can enter the grounds and find the remains of the warehouse buildings crumbling under an extraordinary web of banyan tree roots. In the years since the site was abandoned, the living banyan tree has forced its way through, over, and across the brickwork and concrete. Remarkably, the sprawling roots and branches have excellently preserved the shape of walls, doorways, and roofs that have long since fallen down and been removed. An elevated walkway has been added to the grounds, which allows visitors to navigate the rooms of the Anping Tree House, as it has been dubbed, without too much interruption from the tangled tree roots that hang everywhere. Still, you may need to duck under a few invasive branches as you climb the stairs to explore this wonderfully unusual sight.  You'll find the Anping Tree House just north of Anping Fort and the very popular street market that runs alongside it."

Only a small, nondescript sign hanging above its short entrance hints at its significant history. The tunnel was built by the Japanese in 1903 (Taiwan was under Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945) and is now referred to as the “100-Year Bomb Shelter.” This portal into the city’s underbelly was a refuge for those seeking shelter from the bombs dropped by American forces during World War II. In addition to acting as a long, narrow bomb shelter, the tunnel was also used as an ammunition depot. Now, it serves a far less risky purpose. As it’s concealed within a bustling area, locals have begun using it as an underground shortcut while going to-and-fro. It lets them enter the hillside from one neighborhood and pop out in another, without having to deal with any crowds. Some guides have also started including it as a quirky, off-the-beaten path stop on tours of the city. You won't see many tourist in Keelung but it's an interesting city.

48,Sarez Lake,"Rushon, Tajikistan",The largest dam in the world and the site of a potential disaster.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sarez-lake,"Sarez Lake is a mountain lake deep in the inaccessible Pamir Mountains of Central Tajikistan. The lake was created in 1911, when an earthquake, estimated at 7.0 at the Richter Scale, and a following landslide of 2.2 million cubic meters, created a huge natural barrier known as the Usoi Dam. At a height of 567 meters, it is the largest dam in the world, either natural or man-made. Thanks to its extremely remote location, it took more than a month before local authorities became aware of the creation of this huge dam, which successively allowed the valley to be flooded by constant rain and meltwater. It wasn’t long before the entire unpopulated valley was flooded, and created a lake with a volume of more than 16 cubic kilometers. But this lake is a constant source of worries to the Tajik government, since, given its location in one of the most earthquake-prone regions in the world, it seems highly likely that a future earthquake could destroy the dam and release a catastrophic flash flood. If this flood occurred, the entire content of the lake would be pressed through the narrow valleys of Tajikistan, destroying everything in its way, endangering more than five million people. It could also affect the neighboring countries Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Another constant threat is that filtration water apparently created a number of cavities inside the dam, which might destabilize the entire dam wall. But the largest threat is a partially detached rock mass of three cubic kilometers at the edge of the lake, which, if it fell into the lake, it could put too much additional pressure on the dam, and might result in its collapse. In 2004, a monitoring system has been put in place on Sarez Lake and valleys, that would be affected by the destruction of Sarez Lake, received an early-warning system."
49,Wall of Great Tajik Writers,"Dushanbe, Tajikistan",A building facade covered with the statues of 11 giants of Tajik literature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wall-of-great-tajik-writers,"If you thought that all there was to Tajik literature was the famous Persian poet Rudaki, perhaps you might want to visit the Wall of Great Tajik Writers. The “Wall” is the facade of the Writers’ Union building in Dushanbe, home to an association of novelists, poets, playwrights, and other writers. The large wall is carved with nine niches containing eleven life-size statues of famous Tajik writers, a tribute to Tajikistan’s Persian and Soviet history. The 8th-century “Adam of Poets,” Rudaki, justifiably takes the centre stage. He is considered a father of classical Persian literature, though sadly only a small portion of his work has survived the test of time. Other notable writers on the wall include poet Ferdowsi (940-1020); poet, mathematician and astronomer Omar Khayyam (1048-1131); writer and intellectual Sadriddin Ayni (1878-1954); and poet Mirzo Tursunzoda (1911-1977). In the garden next to the building is a large statue of Ayni and famous Soviet writer Maxim Gorky sitting around a table, absorbed in conversation. The Writers’ Union building was designed by renowned architect E. Salikhov and constructed in the early 1980s. The structure immediately became an exemplary manifestation of Soviet Modernist architecture, a trend that incorporated local sensibilities within the Soviet architectural tradition, which emphasized social purposefulness, grandiosity (regarding size), and frugality (regarding construction materials). All these features are clearly seen in Salikhov’s creation in Dushanbe. The Writers’ Union dates back to the Soviet era, when all literary organizations were absorbed into a union supervised by the government. The objective was to ensure that contemporary and older literary work for public consumption would not contravene Communist ideals. Nowadays, the organization’s goals resemble those of writers’ unions in most any other country.  The Writers’ Union Building is located in the center of the city, next to the National Museum of Tajikistan, Rudaki Park (another tribute to the famous poet), the Dushanbe Flag Pole, and many other attractions in the capital."
50,Yamchun Fort,"Ishkoshim, Tajikistan",This ancient Silk Road outpost overlooking the Wakhan Valley is miraculously still standing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yamchun-fort,"Located between the modern-day border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, at elevations ranging from 9,964 feet (3,037 meters) in Ishkashim to 16,152 feet (4,923 meters) at the Wakhjir Pass, the remote and barren Wakhan Valley was once a thriving corridor along the Silk Road. Ruins of caravanserais, stupas, forts, towers, and palaces littering the whole valley testify to a glorious past. Traders from near and far have been plying the Silk Road for millennia. This flurry of activities did not escape the keen eye of the Kushan Empire, which realized that traders needed safe passage to transport their goods, which they could guarantee in exchange for levies. A large number of fortresses were built with the dual purpose of protecting traders from raiders and protecting the empire from neighboring peoples. Yamchun Fortress is the best preserved of all these constructions. The fortress is not in great shape, but given that it sits on top of a highly eroded hill in an area prone to earthquakes and landslides, it is a marvel that it is still standing. Originally built in 300 BC (or 100 BC according to some sources), Yamchun overlooks large swathes of the Wakhan Valley, and large sections of the Hindu Kush mountains in the northernmost Afghan territories. How much of the original fortress is visible today is debatable, as the ancient structure was expanded between the 10th and 12th centuries. The triangular shape of the fortress follows approximately the shape of the hilltop.  Two layers of fortified walls delineate its perimeter. Round towers with narrow openings look down toward the valley. Looking at the towers still standing, it is clear that they were built in stages, judging from the different coloring of the stones and bonding material. It is suspected that within the Yamchum Fortress there was a Zoroastrian temple of eternal fire. Considering it was the predominant religion of the time, this would be hardly surprising, but there is no unanimous consensus as to whether there actually was a temple in the fortress.  Public transport to Yamchum village is patchy to say the least. Only a handful of shared taxis come this far, but it is common to flag down any passing vehicle and contribute to the cost of the ride.  From Yamchun village to the fortress is another 8 km of gentle uphill switchbacks or 4 km of steep climbing along trails. Having your own vehicle is by far the best option."
51,Hulbuk Fortress,"Pingan, Tajikistan",This medieval citadel once guarded the western entrance of the Pamir Highway.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hulbuk-fortress,"From the ninth to 12th centuries, Hulbuk was one of the biggest cities in Central Asia. There, a citadel guarded the western entrance of the Pamir Highway and the nearby salt mines of Khoja Mumin. Two palaces were built inside the citadel; the lower palace in the ninth and 10th centuries and the upper in the 11th and 12th centuries. But when the kingdom collapsed, so did the citadel. It became overrun by Mongols and Turkish tribes. In the centuries afterward, a new market town, Kulob, was founded nearby. In the 1950s, Soviet archaeologists excavated the site. Several artifacts can be seen in the museum of antiquities in Dushanbe, as well as in the museum at the other site of the road. Wallpaintings of animal-gods, swastikas, and dancers show that Hulbuk was more Zoroastrian than Islamic. Recently, the citadel walls were completely rebuilt in the Muslim style, with shiny bricks and inlaid Koran verses at the majestic entrance gate.  The fortress cannot be missed when traversing between Kulob/Vose and Danghara. There's a lovely museum on the other side of the road. Formally, the fortress is closed to visitors, as excavations are ongoing. But if you're kind, the site warden may answer your questions and tell you about his own excavation work."
52,Shorbulak Observatory,Tajikistan,"This remote, abandoned Soviet observatory promises spectacular views for those who can reach it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shorbulak-observatory,"An abandoned Soviet observatory on the top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere in Tajikistan sounds inviting, no? Shorbulak Observatory, once the site of challenging astronomical observations, stands as a remnant of the former Soviet Union. Located some 4,350 meters (14,200 feet) above sea level, this remote site in the Pamir mountains was perfect for an observatory. The dry climate made it an ideal spot to study submillimeter-wavelength astronomy. Observing these incredibly short wavelengths can be especially challenging because water in the atmosphere can interfere with measurements. Land-based observatories that can study this type of astronomy must be located at dry, cool sites with stable weather conditions located far from dense population. Other sites include Mauna Kea in Hawaii, the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory in Chile, the South Pole, and Hanle in India. Shorbulak was an outpost of the Pulkovo Observatory—officially known as the Central Astronomical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences at Pulkovo. It was one of several offshoots of Pulkovo Observatory, with others located in Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Caucasus Mountains, Chile, and Bolivia. In the 1980s, the observatory was run by Russian astrophysicist Kirill Maslennikov. Though it is no longer active, Shorbulak Observatory still stands in its location in the Pamirs. But reaching it is no easy feat. First you must get to the Pamir Highway, the second highest altitude  highway in the world. Heading south of the city of  Murgab, you must get off the beaten path for a good piece of land and sandy roads. It takes a while, but as soon as you get there you are rewarded with the site of an abandoned Soviet village, old trucks, warehouses, and the empty observatory right over the hill.  It is possible to visit the village and see the outside of the observatory, but the building itself is private property. Please be respectful of the laws and posted signs. Be aware that a 4x4 vehicle is advisable, since is an off-road environment."
53,Tomb of Rudaki,"Panjakent, Tajikistan",Where the father of Persian poetry is laid to rest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tomb-of-rudaki,"Nestled in the Fan mountains in the northwest of Tajikistan is the resting place of the man known as the father of Persian poetry. Born around 859, Rudaki is one of the primary historical figures of post-Soviet Tajikistan, strongly figuring into the national identity as a symbol of not just artistic achievement but also as a cultural touchstone for modern Tajiks. Rudaki, born as Abu ‘Abdollah Ja’far ibn Mohammed, enjoys a certain status as a more glamorous historical figure, one who was semi-royalty, serving as a court poet in Bukhara to the Samanid ruler Nasr II until he lost favor in 937 and returned to his hometown of Panjrud, where he lived the rest of his life in poverty until his death around 941. Also known as an accomplished singer and musician, Rudaki has even been portrayed in Satim Ulughzoda’s 1959 film Qismat-i Sho’ir (in English, “A Poet’s Fate”) as a kind of literary action hero/heartthrob in the dramatized biopic. In Tajikistan’s capital of Dushanbe, about five hours driving distance from Rudaki’s hometown and resting place of Panjrud, everything from the main avenue to a large public park near the parliament building, complete with a giant statue of the poet, are graced by his name. Despite his fame and prominence in Tajik culture in particular, there is a stillness, a sanctity imparted by the mausoleum’s remote location, about 40 miles outside the city of Panjakent. The gravel road leading to Rudaki’s resting place is rocky and uneven, and though the mausoleum was built in 1958, the villagers of Panjrud still look up with surprise at the sight of foreigners and tourists. The keeper of the mausoleum unlocks the carved wooden gates that enclose an expansive, well-manicured, brilliantly green garden filled with roses. Written over the gate—in both the Perso-Arabic script that Rudaki wrote in in the 10th century, and the Cyrillic script in which Tajiki is written in now—is one of the poet’s most famous verses, which states, “There is no greater joy in this world/ Than seeing the faces of friends.” Inside, the surrounding walls and marble floors are a pristine, glowing, almost heavenly white, diffused in natural light that shines from holes in the ceiling onto the dark wooden coffin, topped with marble, resting in the center of the mausoleum. Downhill from Rudaki’s actual resting place is a small museum which displays artifacts from Rudaki’s life and the history of the Sughd region, along with a library of numerous translations and editions of the work of Rudaki and other Persian poets. Academics estimate that Rudaki produced upwards of 100,000 poems, or bayts, although only 1,000 have survived and are in existence today, many of them in fragments and found from varying sources. Still, Rudaki is credited with establishing Persian as a poetic language and influencing the style and form of generations of Persian poets after him.  You can drive from Panjakent via taxi or mashrutka. Nowadays there's a decent asphalt road from the main highway (between Penjikent and Dushanbe) all the way to the parking of the tomb."
54,Ancient Panjakent,"Nohijai Pançakent, Tajikistan",The remains of an ancient city-state along the Silk Road.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ancient-panjakent,"Ancient Panjakent was one of the easternmost settlements of the Sogdiana Empire, an Iranian civilization that ruled large swathes of territories in central Asia more than a thousand years ago. Zoroastrianism was the predominant religion of the empire, and its holy books mention Sogdiana as the second-best land that god created. Sogdiana history goes back to the Bronze Age and further, and includes such historic celebrities as Cyrus the Great, Darius I, Xerxes, and Alexander the Great. But the empire began flourishing around the beginning of the 400s CE, thanks to extensive trade along the Silk Road. Countless Sogdian settlements of all sizes could be found along the famous ancient trade route, and the bigger ones acted as de facto city-states. Panjakent was one of them, and its importance was underpinned by the fact that anyone traveling between Samarkand and Kuhiston Mountains had to pass through this city. Archaeologists found evidence that Panjakent was founded around the year 400 and was abandoned by the end of 800. Year 722 marked the arrival of Arab conquerors, which prompted the abandonment of the city and the introduction of the Islamic religion in the region. Unlike most other ancient settlements in central Asia, Ancient Panjakent was abandoned in haste and never built over by subsequent dwellers. Excavations of the ancient city began in 1946 and are still ongoing. To date, archaeologists have unearthed residential and suburban quarters that include two Zoroastrian temples, modest dwellings, and workshops; the citadel, which includes a large palace and fortified walls; and the necropolis, with evidence of ossuaries and fire-altars typical of Zoroastrian civilizations. Separating these buildings is a network of streets and lanes that were often covered by vaults. The predominant construction method was mud and clay bricks, which is still used nowadays for pens and stables. One of the most remarkable findings in Ancient Panjakent were the frescoes, some of which were remarkably well preserved and show revealing aspects of life and religious beliefs from the era. Some of these frescoes are now housed at Rudaki Museum, located in the centre of Panjakent, while others are in the National Museum in Dushanbe and the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.  The above map coordinates will take you to the Archaeological Museum of Ancient Penjikent excavations. Ancient Panjakent is perched on top of a hill overlooking modern-day Panjakent, and it is not fenced off, which means that there are several entry points. There is, however, an official entrance that taxi drivers usually take visitors to. For a small fee, visitors gain access to the ancient city and the museum across the street. The term “museum” may be an overstatement since it consists of a room with some artifacts excavated in the area and some information about Russian archaeologist B. Marshak, who led the excavations for decades."
55,Tajikistan Lenin Statue,"Khujand, Tajikistan",The largest Lenin statue in Central Asia was moved to an empty field rather than being destroyed.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tajikistan-lenin-statue,"Dismantled and relegated to a field on the outskirts of town, a massive likeness of the Father of the Bolshevik Revolution can’t get any respect in modern society. After decades spent lording over the city, Central Asia’s largest statue of Vladimir Lenin was finally removed from its plinth in downtown Khujand, Tajikistan in May of 2011. Erected in 1974 on the 50th anniversary of Lenin’s death, when Khujand was then called Leninabad, official measurements put the statue at 12 meters in height, plus an additional 12 meters for the base. All together, this made the monument Central Asia’s largest statue of the former leader of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party. But by the dawn of the new millennium, Tajik officials felt the statue’s time had come and gone. So it was with little ceremony and under the cover of darkness that a gigantic likeness of the former leader of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party was dismantled, whereupon his pieces were transported to an out-of-the-way park west of the city called Victory Field. Here Lenin was reassembled atop his perch, where he oversees a field. All this is to say that Tajikistan has effectively relegated Lenin to the safest, deadest quadrant of its history. Back in the bustling sectors of its living, day-to-day world, Lenin’s former footsteps will eventually be occupied by a statue of the founder of Tajik statehood, Ismoili Somoni, where it will likely hold the title of Largest Somoni Statue on Earth.

56,Anzob Tunnel,"Ayni, Tajikistan","This dark, damp, perilous tunnel is the only passage from north to south Tajikistan.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/anzob-tunnel,"The purpose of a tunnel is to get you from one place to another, preferably alive. The Anzob Tunnel is making no promises in that regard. 5,040 meters of tunneled asphalt make up the connection between north and south Tajikistan, arguably a step up from the former dirt road that was regularly closed due to frequent, almost year-round avalanches.  Called “The Tunnel of Fear” and “The Tunnel of Death” by locals, its importance lies in the fact that, unlike the previous route, it avoids cutting through less-than-friendly Uzbekistan. The construction of this route between major cities Dushanbe and Khujand has allowed commerce to flow with far less interruption, and Tajikistan no longer has to be split in two through the entire winter season. Sounds fantastic, so what’s the problem? It can’t be that dangerous, at least not as dangerous as an unfriendly territory or a snowed-in dirt road, right? Let’s start with illumination in the tunnel–there isn’t any. Aside from the headlights of your vehicle and those of your fellow tunnel dwellers, there is no lighting to speak of. Not completely unheard of; an inconvenience really–until you realize there are potholes. Not small potholes that give you a little rattle as you truck along, but BIG potholes. Big, axle-snapping potholes that are difficult to see in the dark tunnel, that also happen to be filled with water. Some of them have several feet of water, and are basically small, tunnel ponds. The tunnel does, theoretically, possess two lanes in the form of two more-or-less separate tunnels through the mountain; however, one of the two tunnels is perpetually closed for repairs, meaning the tunnel is de facto a permanent one-way street. The reality of the tunnel’s width, however, is ignored as Chinese 18-wheelers, SUVs and sturdy Soviet Ladas navigate a gut-wrenching obstacle course that includes not only oncoming traffic but also broken-down construction equipment and feet-deep ponds. Things could be worse, though: you could always break down. There’s a few reasons why breaking down in this tunnel would be less than ideal, especially since the odds are so stacked against getting to the other side unscathed. Besides being trapped in a dark, wet tunnel where other cars are careening around you in chaos, the most terrifying reason to want to keep moving is the lack of ventilation. With one, pathetic fan attempting to push air around, the tunnel is filled with exhaust so thick that visibility is only a few feet. While carbon monoxide poisoning is certain, the amount of time you spend trapped would determine whether that exposure becomes fatal or not. Travelers have reported feeling dizzy, nauseous and ill while passing through the tunnel; reportedly, workers on the tunnel, who are drawn from surrounding villages and rarely possess adequate air filtration systems, have died due to overexposure to the poisonous emissions. But that’s it – if you can survive the traffic, the potholes and the fumes, then you’re home free! Except for the rocks. There is always the occasional falling rock to keep an eye out for. That’s it though. Other than giant, water-filled potholes, no lights, every-man-for-himself navigation, toxic gasses and the sporadic avalanche, the Anzob Tunnel is totally safe. The tunnel was repaired in the spring and summer of 2015 and is reportedly in much better condition than previously; however, the one-lane-only issue remains. In 2018, the tunnel was just a regular tunnel in Central Asia; for the most part it is lit now, the surface is decent asphalt and there is plenty of room in the “one-lane” for trucks and cars in both directions."
57,Hisor Fort,"Hisor, Tajikistan","The first version of this stalwart construction appeared around 3,000 years ago.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hisor-fort,"Hisor Fort is conveniently located along the Khanaka River, in Hisor Valley. The building has gone through different reconstructions, renovations, and additions. Historical records point at a fort in Hisor as far back as 1000 BC. More recent records of the fort relate to the time when Cyrus the Great founded the first Persian Empire (around 550 BC). Not much of the original fort has passed the test of time, unfortunately. Dating the current fort is not a straightforward task, as different buildings were added at different times. Inside the fortress, recently, a wedding ceremony building was erected. The oldest surviving part of Hisor Fort is the arched gate, which is probably from around the year 500. Chasmai Mohiyon Mosque was built in 700, the same period of time when the construction of Sangin Mosque (Stone Mosque) also started, but this wasn’t completed until almost 1,000 years later. A salient feature of Sangin Mosque is the four bottomless jugs placed within the walls of the dome to improve the acoustics of the hall. The 1500s mark the building of several components of the fort, namely the wall where the main gate is located, the Old Madrassa, the Makhdumi A’zam Mausoleum, and some additions to the Old Mosque. One of the latest additions next to the fort is a caravanserai from 1808, a place for Silk Road traders and their camels to safely spend the night. Only the lower part of the caravanserai remains, as the top layer was taken by the Soviets to build a theater in Dushanbe. Most of the structures have been renovated. The Old Madrassa houses a museum with items from Tajikistan’s rural past and Soviet memorabilia. Also, old horse stables can be found on the other side of the road.  Hisor is about 16 miles west of Dushanbe. There is plenty of public transport to reach the place, but it is not easy to locate the correct bus stop in Dushanbe. The easiest and fastest to get to Hisor is by taxi, which can be cheap, depending on your bargaining skills. Visiting Hisor Fort on Sunday pretty much guarantees the opportunity to run into a wedding or three."
58,Dushanbe Flagpole,"Dushanbe, Tajikistan",The world's second-tallest flagpole stands proud despite dropping rank.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dushanbe-flagpole,"How high does the Flag of Tajikistan fly? According to the Guinness Book of World Records, higher than any other at a dizzying 541 ft. The Dushanbe Flagpole was constructed by a San Diego-based construction company named Trident Support, who also erected the record breaker’s runner up, the 531 ft. National Flagpole in Azerbaijan. Consisting of 12-meter sections of steel tubing which were assembled by crane, the massive endeavor took five months to complete, the first test flight of the national flag taking place in May, 2011. Such was the state of things until 2014, when its position was usurped by Saudi Arabia’s Jedda Flagpole, which measured in at 170 meters in height. All three flagpoles occupying the top spots on what would be the world’s most precarious podium, in addition to also-rans in Jordan and Abu Dhabi, were marketed, sold and built by Trident Support Corporation, based in San Diego, California. Originally a defense logistics company, Trident has managed to corner the market on this obscure niche of what’s been called the “global dictator dick-measuring contest” since the turn of the new millennium. Tajikistan’s erstwhile most-gigantic-flagpole-ever can be found standing tall in front of Palace of Nations in Dushanbe. In total, the project cost the fledgling nation $3.5 million, part of an exorbitant $210 million spent on construction celebrating the 20th anniversary of Tajikistan’s independence. The Flag of Tajikistan that graces the mighty pole had to be epic in its own right to be seen from such a great distance, weighing in at 1,543 pounds, and measuring approximately 98 × 196 feet. Regardless of whether it occupies the silver medal position for long, when viewed from the ground, those 15 feet that currently separate it from dominating its competitors are hardly noticeable, making for an awesome spectacle made all the more disorienting when placed against the backdrop of Dushanbe’s modest cityscape."
59,Red Lotus Lake,"Tambon Chiang Haeo, Thailand",Stunning wetlands ablaze with pink lotus flowers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lotus-lake,"A true surprise in northeast Thailand—often considered to be solely a rice-farming region—these wetlands remain predominantly hidden by tall elephant grasses that belie the expanses of water lying beyond them, and are known for the most part only by the local villagers who venture out to fish and to collect snails and lotus stalks for use in the preparation of their daily meals. Best visited in the cool season from December through February, these shallow, limpid waters may only be visited on a wooden boat belonging to the local fishermen and villagers. Having cleared the elephant grasses, a thick carpet of pink lotus blooms suddenly confronts you. A constellation of millions of startling, flamingo-pink lotus flowers dance above the crystalline waters of the Lotus Sea. This is quite literally the land of the lotus-eaters! The seeds and stems may both be eaten, and the flowers are an important Buddhist symbol. If the lotus plant does not seduce you from a culinary standpoint, then do try the fiery local cuisine with its spicy salads, lime-bathed fish, and fresh meat dishes: the food of the Northeast has now become a favorite among the Thais and may be found throughout the kingdom. The wetlands are home to around 80 species of bird, including the endangered grey heron, purple heron, and black kite. Other rare species include the Brahminy kite and the cotton pygmy-goose.  Due to the picturesque sea of pink and red lotus flowers which cover lake Nong Han, this place becomes insanely busy during Valentine's Day weekend by couples all waiting to capture that perfect shot. There is also a Red Lotus Sea Festival which is held mid-January at the nearby Wat Bandiem. From Udon Thani Airport, the lake is around 50km (31 miles) away and is easily reached in about one hour by hiring a local driver, motorcycle, or a car.  Booking a place to stay within minutes of the lake's boat departure point is the most convenient option, at properties such as Gecko Villa or Green Gecko."
60,Wat Rong Khun,"Chiang Rai, Thailand",A white Buddhist temple with a golden restroom.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-rong-khun,"In a nation of temples, Thailand’s Wat Rong Khun stands out. Known as the White Temple, Wat Rong Khun is located in Northern Thailand in Chiang Rai. The project of well-known Thai artist Chalermchai Kosipipat, and the temple was funded by Kosipipat’s selling of his paintings. Construction began in 1997 and was completed in 2008, although new elements are still being added. Kosipipat wanted to create an elegant temple to honor Buddha’s purity, but the temple is distinct in both its style and symbolism. Much of the temple is dedicated to depicting samsara, the Buddhist cycle of birth and death due to delusion and fixation on the self.  Thus, the temple and its grounds are surprisingly contemporary, focusing on fictional elements of our materialistic world: the predator struggling to free itself from the ground, aliens, and elaborate murals depicting Neo from The Matrix, Superman, and an angry bird flying towards the World Trade Center Towers. Photography of the murals is prohibited, but visitors can purchase reproductions at the gift shop. Unlike most Thai temples, the building is all white, with glass and mirrors embedded into the outside to make it shine and sparkle in the sunlight. However, Kosipipat ultimately designed the White Temple to be viewed in moonlight when it appears particularly ghostly and otherworldly. An ornately decorated gold building to the left of the temple houses a public restroom, which is often humorously referred to as the most beautiful restroom in Thailand. The White Temple was severely damaged in a 2014 earthquake, but it has been fully restored.  The temple closes between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m., when no visitors are allowed inside."
61,Wat Samphran Temple,"Khlong Mai, Thailand",An enormous dragon scales the walls of this 17-story temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-samphran-temple,"With the Wat Samphran Temple, what you see is what you get:  while a smattering of awed visitors across the web have expressed admiration for this impressive work of architecture, details such as when it was built, who designed it, or why this 17-story tower is in the clutches of a massive, beautiful dragon are nowhere to be found. The Wat Samphran Temple is rarely featured in guidebooks and is considerably removed from the typical tourist track. Travelers who’ve happened upon the temple in their journeys have described an interior in mild disrepair but filled with stunning statues and shrines, including a giant bronze Buddha. The dragon itself is reportedly hollow, and visitors are able to walk some sections of it, though other parts of the temple remain closed to the public."
62,Phraya Nakhon Cave,"Sam Roi Yot, Thailand","At the right time of day, sunlight floods through the roof of this cave and illuminates the small pavilion hidden within.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phraya-nakhon-cave,"Seen at the perfect moment, few sights in Thailand are more spectacular than the Phraya Nakhon Cave. As the rays of the morning sun flood through the roof of the cavern, a small pavilion on the floor of the cave is bathed in a majestic golden glow. It’s the kind of place Indiana Jones would find a fabled life-renewing relic, or where a young apprentice would finally meet a reclusive Jedi Master. The Phraya Nakhon Cave is located inside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park in the Prachuap Khiri Khan Province of Thailand. According to local legend, the cave was discovered around 200 years ago when a local ruler, Nakhon Srithammaraja, was forced to abandon his ship during a storm and found refuge in the cave. Some historians, however, believe the cave was discovered by, or at least named after, a nobleman called Nakhon, who lived in the region in the 17th century. Either way, the cave has long been a treasured natural attraction along the northern part of the Malay Peninsula. When sunlight floods into the cavern, it illuminates the cave’s stalagmites and stalactites, and the lush green trees that lean toward the light from the sandy floor below. It’s a serene and mystical sight, and one deemed fit for kings. In 1890, for the visit of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), a mound was built inside the cave. Upon this mound was placed a small pavilion, built in Bangkok and assembled inside the cave. Positioned perfectly to catch the full flood of the morning sunlight, the Khuha Kharuehat Pavilion, as it is known, has since become an iconic symbol of the Prachuap Khiri Khan Province. It was later visited by King Prajadhipok (Rama VII), who, like King Chulalongkorn, inscribed his name on the wall of the cavern’s main chamber. The late King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) also visited the Phraya Nakhon Cave, but unlike his predecessors he did not leave his signature on the wall.  Phraya Nakhon Cave is located inside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park in the Prachuap Khiri Khan Province of Thailand. It’s about 110 miles south-southwest from Bangkok (as the crow flies), and about a 45-minute drive south of Hua Hin. From the small village of Bang Pu, you can either take a boat around the cape to the cave, or hike for 30 to 45 minutes. Either way, you’ll still have a final 1,410-feet hike up steep steps through the forest to the cave entrance. It’s tough going, so take water. The entrance fee to Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park is 200 Thai Baht per person, with no additional fee for the cave. Guides are available but unnecessary, and many of them are children. Go early to avoid the crowds. The sun tends to enter the cave around 10 to 10:30 a.m., although it depends on the season, so best to ask in advance."

Founded in 1975, the park is named for the mythical three-headed white elephant which the uppermost of the falls is said to resemble. In addition to the waterfalls the park is also home to a series of caves known as Mi, Rua, Wang Bahdan, and Phartat. Visitors can hike along the seven waterfalls and swim in their pools.   The 3rd-7th waterfalls close by 15:30, while the 1st and 2nd tiers close around 16:30-17:00, depending on how the rangers feel.If you are pressed for time, hike to the top first, and swim in the waterfalls on the way down because after 3:30, the top most levels will be closed off."
64,The Wang Saen Suk Hell Garden,"Tambon Saen Suk, Thailand",Walk through depictions of the torture inflicted on those who go to Buddhist hell.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-wang-saen-suk-hell-garden-tambon-saen-suk-thailand,"Wang Saen Suk is a garden full of statues depicting what is supposed to be Buddhist hell. While the garden attracts plenty of families, there are gruesome scenes depicted there. After passing a “Welcome to Hell!” sign, visitors encounter sinners boiled in copper cauldrons, sinners being torn apart by hell’s dogs, and emaciated sinners with protruding ribs. “If you meet the Devil in this life, don’t postpone merit-making which will help you to defeat him in the next life,” a sign in the garden reads. “Donate a little each day and you’ll have a happy life.” According to the “Traibhumi Phra Ruang,” when a Buddhist dies, he or she goes before four celestial beings who check the dead’s record of good and bad deeds. If your good deeds outweigh the bad, you will go to heaven; if your bad deeds outweigh the good, you will be punished. Punishment in Buddhist hell varies depending on the sins committed, but every form of punishment is a torture, and many of those are depicted in the garden. Hell has 136 pits, but individuals are able to be reborn from each. Loganta, a special pit reserved for those who have hurt their parents or monks physically, is the only cold pit and those sent there are said to remain until a new Buddha is born.  The temple is a little difficult to find at first glance. Go all the way down the road until you see an archway. Go through it and you'll see a giant Buddha. Once you get there, be sure to put some donation into the Buddha belly. This temple will not charge you so make sure to leave something generous so they can keep maintaining this amazing location.This is located in Chonburi and takes some time and work to get to from Bangkok for tourists not familiar with the area. If you have a lot of time in Bangkok or can see it as a side trip on the way to Pattaya, then it is pretty interesting to see. Otherwise, plan on it taking up the majority of your day if you're traveling from Bangkok."
65,Amulet Market,"Bangkok, Thailand",Bangkok's men with dangerous jobs come here in search of protective talismans.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amulet-market,"Who’s to say what form divine protection may take? Known as the Amulet Market, the corridors are lined with stalls whose only wares are thousand upon thousands of sacred trinkets bestowed with protections. The exact protections of each amulet vary, offering to ward off evil of all manner both spiritual and physical in nature. Filled of locals and visitors alike, everyone is here to pick through the vendors’ wares for the special medallion or figurine that will do the trick for them: protecting the harvest, bringing good health, blessing a new home. When it comes to the amulets themselves, there aren’t a lot of hard and fast rules. Few of the articles for sale are larger than, say, a baseball, while most fit easily in the palm of one’s hand. Many are purported to contain particles from sacred temples far away, such as spent incense, blessings from monks, etc. The amulets can take the form of Buddhas bearing a range of expressions, to shards of bone, medallions, chunks of wood from sacred spaces varying expressions, brass phalluses, or even real human parts – like hair. All these elements combine to create tokens of good luck that have been protecting generations of working Thai men from all sorts of terrible fates. At the Amulet market, there are no shamans around to help in the divination process. It’s up to each individual doing the digging to identify which treasure speaks to their need. This makes a simple people-watching excursion to the Amulet Market one of the more gratifying and mystical experiences around, even if you yourself aren’t looking to take home a small something with magical potential. Amulets can cost as little as 5 baht (the same price as a trip to some public toilets) and up to hundreds of baht. Prices are rarely displayed, implying some haggling or bargaining is necessary. While you’re in the area, don’t forget about the nearby side alleys (heading towards the water). Some heavy rings and more amulets may catch your eyes, and there are enough cheap food stalls to feed the staff that work in the immediate area. Serviced by ferries from Chang Pier, Maharaj Pier, and Phra Chan Tai Pier. From National Stadium BTS, take exit 2 down to street level, make a U-turn, and walk 20 meters to the bus stop. Get on bus 47 and ride for 20-30 minutes. Get off when you’re in front of the Grand Palace or Sanam Luang (the big park just past it). There’s a side street heading left between the two; head down that for about 400 meters and turn right. The beginning of the market should be across the street to your right."

Or, in the case of Bangkok restaurant Wattana Panich, the next generation.

Growing up studying the exact flavor profile of the stew from his father, Kaweenuntawong now balances the flavor himself daily. He employs an ancient practice called Hunter’s Stew or Perpetual Stew, using some of the previous day’s leftover broth to start the base of the following day’s soup. “We keep tasting. There is no recipe,” he told Channel News Asia. A secret blend of spices and herbs, stewed beef, raw beef slices, meatballs, tripe, and other organs swim about the deeply bubbling vat. While new restaurants and high-end condominiums now dwarf the humble one-story bistro in Bangkok’s busy Ekamai neighborhood, the complex and rich flavor of Wattana Panich’s headline soup keeps the dish relevant and its followers loyal."

Although this tower karst was a relatively unknown indigenous site before the early ’70s, that all changed when the British Secret Service’s number one agent came to town. In 1974, the James Bond film The Man With the Golden Gun was released. One of the film’s scenes featured Bond’s nemesis, Francisco Scaramanga, hiding out at Phang Nga Bay and using the solar panels on the island to power his laser gun. The movie, which referred to the island as a “mushroom-shaped rock,” catapulted Phang Nga Bay’s tourism industry, so much so that the island was dedicated to 007 himself with the name of James Bond Island. But James Bond is not the only namesake of the tall little islet, which is located just offshore from Khao Phing Kan island, part of Ao Phang Nga National Park. According to local mythology, the island was created when one day a Thai fisherman failed to catch a single fish and came up only with a nail. In frustration, he’d throw the nail into the ocean, but magically, the nail would return to his hand. In anger, the fisherman cut the nail in half with a knife, letting the half-nail fall into the bay. To the fisherman’s astonishment, the half-nail erupted to form the giant nail-shaped limestone tower that stands today, giving it its original Thai name, Ko Ta Pu, or Nail Island."

It is housed in Siriraj Hospital, Thailand’s oldest hospital and medical school, which was established in 1886 and is where the King of Thailand goes when he is ill. The Siriraj is actually comprised of six different museums: a museum of pathology, a forensics museum, a museum of the history of Thai medicine, a parasitology museum, an anatomical museum, and a prehistoric museum. The Ellis Pathological Museum is the oldest of the six museums, founded by the American pathologist Dr. Aller G. Ellis. He collected organs from patients who had been diagnosed with common disorders such as heart disease and cancer,  to serve as teaching tools for medical students. The Siriraj’s incredible holdings include bones, preserved organs, pathological fetuses, the mummified corpse of a notorious serial killer, a traditional Thai medicine shop, parasitic worms, a two-and-a-half-foot-wide scrotum removed from a man afflicted with elephantiasis, preserved sections of human skin bearing tattoos, poisonous snakes and tarantulas, rows of skulls, the standing wax-filled remains of a cannibal, a delicately dissected nervous system, and the skeleton of the museum’s founder.

70,Bangkok's Ghost Tower: The Sathorn Unique,"Bangkok, Thailand",On stormy days debris from this unfinished and abandoned skyscraper rains down on the Bangkok streets.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bangkoks-ghost-tower-the-sathorn-unqiue,"The Sathorn Unique skyscraper is among the major construction projects started when Thailand’s economy was booming in the 1990s. Developers envisaged a city of gleaming offices and residential skyscrapers that were to be a testament to the nation’s rapid development. Then Thailand sank into a swamp of reckless investments and unpaid debts that became known as the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. The country’s economy contracted 10% in 1998 and many of the building projects came to a crashing halt, including this 49-story tower. Many towers have finally come to completion and construction is continuing, however many broke developers are still unable or unwilling to take action. The Sathorn Unique has an eerie feel, with exposed infrastructure giving it a post-apocalyptic look. According to one blogger, abandoned rooms were filled with curious objects, from mannequins to a picture of the King. Locals say that the building is haunted. Have a look at the building’s commercial brochure: “Sathorn Unique Tower is our first residential project in downtown Bangkok. The tower is 49 stories with the total of 659 residential units and 54 retails, located only less than 200 meters from BTS: Taksin station. Sathorn Unique Tower is also located at the edge of old commercial town of Charernkrung meets the new international business zone of Silom-Sathorn roads. It sits on the horse-shoe bend which is considered the best place for overlook at the Bangkok’s grand cityscape and the charm of the Chaopraya River.” Getting to the top terrace of the building is possible, but it is absolutely not a good idea, and the structure is fragile and bares many holes in the floors. Instead, check out the tower’s 10-storey high car park, just opposite to the building (North side of the tower). Adapted with permission from Exploguide.com dedicated to travelers looking for alternative and off the beaten track travel.  This place is off limits. As of June 2016, a fence made of corrugated tin now surrounds the tower, and there's plenty of signs indicating that trespassers will be prosecuted. It's not impossible to get in, but it's certainly illegal. There are people working or living within the corrugated walls of the Sathorn depsite its rundown state. It is infinitely disconcerting to see the shadows shifting on the high ceilings and a face peering out at you from between the metal sheets. So trek wisely."
71,Maeklong Railway Market,"Mae Klong, Thailand","Six times a day a train runs right through the middle of this Thai street market, sending vendors scrambling.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-maeklong-railway-market-mae-klong-thailand,"Six times a day, a train rolls right through the centre of the Maeklong Railway Market. Six times a day, vendors and buyers have three minutes to get out of the way. A very loud whistle gives the warning call, and everyone scrambles to move produce off the tracks, roll back awnings, and take down umbrellas before the train arrives. In fact, the market is sometimes called the “umbrella pull down market” for this very reason. But vendors have to do a lot more than that. They have to pick up baskets of fish, beans, and bananas and move them off the tracks. In some cases, they just leave them as they know the train will clear them. As the train comes through the very narrow market lane, there is only inches to spare on each side. Maeklong Railway Market is also called the world’s most dangerous market. Unfortunately, people have occasionally lost their lives, though the train moves very slowly through the market. The bizarre phenomenon leads many people to visit the market for the novelty of seeing the train run right through it, rather than for the goods sold. The market sells mostly fresh foods, Thai sweets, flowers, herbs, spices, drinks, fish, and seafood. In fact, it’s one of the biggest seafood markets in Thailand. But the food aside, seeing the sprawling market spring to life when the train rolls through makes for a worthwhile stop when you’re in the area. Just remember: when you hear the whistle, step back, and maybe get your camera ready.  The market is located in Samut Songkhram city, Muang Samut Songkhram District, which runs along the Gulf of Thailand’s coastline southwest of Bangkok. It’s only about 60km from Bangkok. You can get there by train, public van (minibus), or car. A fun thing to do is ride the Maeklong Railway through the market, and then get off and explore."
72,Wat Pha Sorn Kaew (Temple on the Glass Cliff),"Tambon Khaem Son, Thailand",Modern design and unusual architecture make this mountaintop temple no ordinary Buddhist retreat.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-phar-sorn-kaew-temple-on-the-glass-cliff,"Hidden away high up in the hills of north central Thailand, Wat Pha Sorn Kaew is a Dharma retreat for monks and Buddhist followers. The mountaintop sanctuary, with a preaching hall, pagoda, and surrounding gardens, is a stunning design, one that expresses its architectural youthfulness. The site’s location at Khao Kho was chosen for its natural beauty, to inspire meditation. Set against the serenity of the mountains is the site’s most striking feature, the ice-white temple itself, representing the traditional five Buddhas who visited the Earth. The Buddhas are nested together in the meditation position, looking out over the valley. Each one is slightly larger than the one before, a modern and refreshing design with few hints of traditional Thai architecture. The non-traditional design extends to the pagoda, a lotus flower-inspired shape set over five levels, with a large glass structure hanging down through the centre to connect each floor. The surfaces are covered with over 5 million mosaic tiles, pottery shards, and pieces of teapots and China sets, with no two patterns alike. It’s colorful and quirky, and sitting in the middle of the mosaics is said to bring fortune and good luck. Wat Pha Sorn Kaew (also known as Wat Pra Tat Pha Kaew and Watpratarpharsornkaew) was mostly completed in 2004, and was elevated to the status of temple only in 2010. In its short history, despite its remote location, it has become a center for the foundation of mindfulness practice, one of the core Buddhist principles. It could be argued that Wat Pha Sorn Kaew feels out of place in the remote hills of northern Thailand, and it does bear a striking resemblance to the style of Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí. Its style is unlike any other, but no matter the design, the views are breathtaking and the landscape inspiring. In that respect, the temple in the mountains is much like its traditional ancestors. Wat Pha Sorn Kaew is a relatively new site, having been completed in 2004, and is not widely recognised as a tourist attraction, therefore it can be quite difficult to visit. It is located about 5 hours north of Bangkok, between the towns of Lom Sak and Phitsanulok in the Phetchabun region. At present, the only way of reaching the temple is by your own transport or on a private tour."
73,Wat Mahathat (Temple of the Great Relic),"Bangkok, Thailand","The headquarters of the Mahanikai school of Buddhism, Thailand's largest monastic order.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-mahathat-temple-of-the-great-relic,"The temple of Wat Mahathat was founded in the 18th century, even before the founding of Bangkok (1782). It has been considerably altered over the years, most notably by the young Prince Mongkut who would later become King Rama IV of Thailand. Today, the temple is the headquarters of the Mahanikai school of Buddhism, Thailand’s largest monastic order. It’s used as a center for monastic learning for members of the school who come from all across Southeast Asia. The temple is also home to the Center for Vipassana Meditation at Buddhist University, and is one of several in Bangkok that offers classes in meditations. Some programs are taught in English. Originally built to house a relic of the Buddha, Wat Mahathat is one of the oldest shrines in Bangkok. The temple is tucked away on the grounds, surrounded by a confusing layout of schools, offices, and other buildings. When you come to the entrance to the inner courtyard, push your way through the door. It tends to be closed to keep out the noise of the surrounding environs. The courtyard is packed with statues and relics, with an out-of-place garden of tall palm trees pushed to the back. Next to the temple, vendors gather every Sunday for Bangkok’s largest amulet market, where they peddle religious amulets, talismans, charms, and traditional medicine. All of the amulets have a different purpose: to restore health, to bring great wealth, or to keep enemies away, for example.  The Temple is located near Sanam Luang Park, between the Grand Palace and the National Museum. Enter on Mahathat Road."
74,Elephant Nature Park,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Thailand's distressed elephants find peace at this Chiang Mai sanctuary.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephant-nature-park,"Set in Thailand’s Chiang Mai province, Elephant Nature Park provides a sanctuary to rescued elephants from around the country. Originally founded in 1990, Elephant Nature Park is roughly 60 kilometers from Chiang Mai city, tucked away in the picturesque hills of Northern Thailand. Serving as a rescue and rehabilitation center for elephants from around the country, Elephant Nature Park is—simply put—the ethical way to enjoy the company of a pachyderm when in Asia. In Thailand, elephant populations have decreased significantly from 100,000 a century ago to now a measly 3,000 estimated elephants remaining. The decline in elephant numbers is namely due to the animals being used for the tourism and logging industries, which subjects these magnificent creatures to harrowing abuse. For tourists, riding an elephant or purchasing a painting from a pachyderm may seem harmless enough, but it is the “training” techniques used to have the animals perform such feats that are cause for concern. Mahouts—a term for men who work with elephants in Southeast Asia—often subject their animals to barbaric forms of physical abuse to intimidate, scare, and ultimately break the spirit of the elephant. At Elephant Nature Park, the rescued elephants who arrive at the sanctuary can often come with broken bones, psychological issues, and baring the scars of years of abuse. The silver lining is Elephant Nature Park fights to save these animals and give them a stress-free environment where volunteers can spend time with the elephants in an ethical way. From feeding the elephants copious amounts of watermelon to walking alongside them as they meander down the river, to simply watching them play in the mud, Elephant Nature Park puts the focus on the wellbeing of its animals. In short, a visit to this sanctuary is how animal tourism should be: putting the animal first.  A visit to Elephant Nature Park requires advance booking online. Volunteers have the option of a one-day visit with the elephants, a half-day visit, or a two-day visit with an overnight stay on the property. If timing permits, it is worth spending the night at Elephant Nature Park to truly experience the beauty of this animal sanctuary and catch some extra time with the elephants. While the main draw of Elephant Nature Park is the elephants, the sanctuary is also home to cats and dogs that have been rescued from around the country. Elephant Nature Park has additional locations in Cambodia, Surin, and Kanchanaburi with different volunteer programs and lengths offered at each park."
75,St. Regis Lhasa Resort Swimming Pool,"Lhasa, Tibet","Described as ""the world's most blinging pool.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-regis-lhasa-resort-swimming-pool,"On top of a hill with incredible views in Tibet and only minutes away from tourism-friendly UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the St. Regis Lhasa Resort is one of the world’s most decadent retreats. Surrounded by the towering Himalayas, the hotel, which is situated on eight acres of land, bills itself as “standing on the roof of the world.” The resort’s 162 guest rooms, villas, and suites - each with either mountain views or a view of the Potala Palace, the museum that formerly housed the Dalai Lama until 1959 - feature high speed Internet access, 24-hour butler service, Bose sound systems, large marble bathrooms, 42-inch plasma televisions, and more. But it’s the swimming pool that really puts this five-star hotel over the top. Described as “the world’s most blinging pool” by the Daily Mail, the pool at the St. Regis Lhasa Resort is plated in gold. “Not content with views of the Himalayas and Tibet’s first ever fine-dining restaurant, the hotel decided luxury wasn’t luxury until its spa looked like something P. Diddy would love to hang around his neck,” the Daily Mail wrote. “And so the swimming pool was lined with thousands of golden tiles.”"
76,Rongbuk Monastery and Guesthouse,"Rikaze Diqu, Tibet",The highest monastery in the world operates a tiny guesthouse with doors open to all.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rongbuk-monastery-and-guesthouse,"At 16,340 feet above sea level, situated near the base of Mount Everest’s north face, nowhere on Earth is it possible to be both physically and spiritually closer to the heavens than at Rongbuk Monastery. Currently home to up to 30 Buddhist monks and nuns in residence, Rongbuk was established in 1909 by Ngawang Tenzin Norbu in its present location. Long known for having meditation huts and caves used by a community of hermetic Buddhist monks and nuns, the monastery is noteworthy for its sprawling grounds containing a main hall with statues of the Buddhist deities Sakyamuni and Padmasambhava, intricate murals, and a prominent chorten containing a reliquary. The first half of the 20th century found Rongbuk booming on religious as well as mountaineering fronts. Once rumored to house 500 devout followers, the monastery gradually expanded to include seven chapels. A modest guesthouse was also added adjacent to the monk and nuns’ quarters for those making briefer spiritual pilgrimages. This addition laid the groundwork for accommodating the ever-increasing number of adventurers drawn to Rongbuk by the tantalizing mountain peaks in its backyard, which continues to this day. Lodging specifications at the monastery’s guesthouse won’t surprise anyone considering it’s being run by reclusive monks at one of the most remote locations in the world. Shared outdoor latrines, tiny rooms, limited heating, and minimal electricity are realities, though most seeking a stay at Rongbuk are doing so for its vantage into the natural and metaphysical, not the tangible.  Accessible by road via a two- to three-hour drive from the Friendship Highway by way of either Shelkar or Old Tingri."
77,Drigung Monastery,"Lhasa, Tibet",This Tibetan monastery has survived multiple attacks and is also a sky burial site.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/drigung-monastery,"Tibetan monasteries with their peaceful and silent atmospheres might seem unlikely candidates for violence and politics, but the Drigung Thil monastery near Lhasa suffered great destruction early in its history before being rebuilt to become the structure seen today. The fortress-like monastery, also called Drikung, was founded by Kyowa Jigten Sumgon in the late 12th century, and his Drigung Kagyu school of teachings soon acquired a huge following. With its increasing popularity and political power came a rivalry with another influential sect, the Sakyas. The Sakyas eventually led a march on the monastery in 1290 and destroyed it. Though its political clout declined, the monastery was rebuilt and is today an important spiritual center, especially known for its meditation techniques. During the Cultural Revolution, the monastery suffered another series of attacks, with many of its statues and manuscripts looted and buildings damaged. The current site overlooks the Shorong valley and contains traditionally decorated temples, prayer halls, and residences for around 250 monks. The monastery is also well-known for its sky burial site, situated at a height of 14,975 feet on the mountaintop. The death ceremonies are performed by the monks every afternoon, and the following morning the bodies are carried to the lofty site, which is surrounded by small stupas and temples. Himalayan vultures are invited to feed on the flesh, and anything that remains is burnt and offered to the sky in another ritual. It is one of the last remaining places in the world where the traditional excarnation ritual is practiced."
78,Tanggula Railway Station,"Naqu, Tibet","At 16,627 feet above sea level, this unstaffed station is the highest in the world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tanggula-railway-station,"The Tanggula Railway Station sits on the vast Tibetan Plateau, a high-altitude landscape beset by permafrost. But despite its bleak isolation, this lonely, unstaffed railway station has a lofty claim to fame: at 16,627 feet above sea level, it’s the highest railway station in the world. The 1,215-mile-long Qingzang Railway runs from Qinghai to Lhasa, passing through many desolate and barely habitable landscapes. It was an astounding feat of construction, and one that had to overcome numerous problems, particularly on the Golmud to Lhasa section where workers had to contend with both extremely high altitudes and permafrost. Upon its completion, however, the railway was rewarded with a handful of world records. It was recognized as being the highest railway in the world, with the world’s highest railway tunnel (the Fenghuoshan Tunnel) and the world’s highest railway station. The Tanggula Railway Station was inaugurated on July 1, 2006, along with the Golmud to Lhasa section of the Qingzang Railway. The platform stretches for more than half a mile, but the station’s facilities are almost as stark as the landscape surrounding it. The station is unstaffed, and while some trains do stop here briefly, passengers normally have to remain on the train. The surrounding area is pretty much uninhabited, and the station serves as a stop-off for repairs or emergencies, with few, if any, passengers actually wanting to disembark at Tanggula. But the view from the station (or from the train as it stops or passes by) is impressive. And less than a mile from the station is the Tanggula Pass, which at 16,640 feet above sea level is the highest point of the Qingzang Railway.  The Qingzang Railway, also known as the Qinghai–Tibet Railway, runs from Xining in the Qinghai Province of China to Lhasa in Tibet. There are 45 stations along the Golmud to Lhasa section, 38 of which are unstaffed. Some stations have “scenic platforms” where passengers can disembark briefly to enjoy the scenery, at least during the day. The Tanggula Railway Station was built partly because of its impressive views, but there’s no guarantee that the train will stop, let alone let people off. Ask in advance about the possibly of disembarking at Tanggula, as some services might be more likely to stop than others."
79,The Gates of Hell,Turkmenistan,A fiery crater has been burning in the Karakum Desert since 1971.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-gates-of-hell-turkmenistan,"In the hot, expansive Karakum desert in Turkmenistan, near the 350-person village of Darvaza, is a hole 230 feet wide that has been on fire for over 50 years. Though technically called the Darvaza gas crater, locals know the crater as “The Gates of Hell.” Its fiery glow can be seen for miles around. The Gates of Hell crater was created in 1971 when a Soviet drilling rig accidentally punched into a massive underground natural gas cavern, causing the ground to collapse and the entire drilling rig to fall in. Having punctured a pocket of gas, poisonous fumes began leaking at an alarming rate. To head off a potential environmental catastrophe, the Soviets set the hole alight, figuring it would stop burning within a few weeks. Decades later, and the fiery pit is still going strong. The Soviet drilling rig is believed to still be down there somewhere, on the other side of the “Gates of Hell.” Amazingly, despite the crater’s foreboding name and ever-present flames, people still trek into the desert to witness the site in all its blazing glory. The nearby desert has become a popular place for wild camping. But the fate of the burning crater may be in limbo. In January 2022, President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov ordered the government of Turkmenistan to begin researching how to put the fire out.

80,Köw Ata Underground Lake,"Gokdepe, Turkmenistan",This cavernous swimming spot doubles as a home to the largest known colony of bats in Central Asia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koew-ata-underground-lake,"In Turkmenistan, a sun-scorched Central Asian country where over 80 percent of the land is covered in desert, finding a place to swim can often be a challenge. The landlocked nation has access to the Caspian Sea, the world’s largest lake, but it’s a long way from the capital city of Ashgabat. Most people from the capital region prefer the country’s next best swimming spot—which is located more than 200 feet underground. A long metal staircase leads down into the Bakharden Cave, where the 235-foot-long lake is located. The warm waters contain a high amount of different salts and minerals, most notably sulfur, which is responsible for the distinct smell within the cave. Thus, Köw Ata Underground Lake is also the closest thing Turkmenistan has to a thermal spa. Aside from being a swimming spot and a thermal spa, the cave is also a natural monument, established to protect the largest known colony of bats in the whole of Central Asia. It is a question of personal taste, whether this fact adds to a pleasurable swim or not.  The lake is best visited with your own transportation, and it's about an hour to an hour an a half's drive from Ashgabat. Admission is not free. It's best to bring a change of clothing, so you don't smell like sulfur after visiting the lake."
81,Ancient Merv,"Merv, Turkmenistan",This famed Silk Road oasis was one of the largest cities in the world before it was destroyed by a Mongol horde.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ancient-merv,"One of the most famous cities you’ve (probably) never heard of, Merv served as the capital of a number of empires and kingdoms over the course of its more than 4,000-year-long history. With plentiful water reserves and a supremely strategic location between the Afghan highlands and the Karakum Desert lowlands, Merv was a sought-after geographic prize for Persians, Arabs, Turks, and Greeks alike—including Alexander the Great, who ancient Roman author Pliny the Elder claimed actually first founded the city. Whether or not that’s true, it’s indisputable that Merv was eventually transformed from a simple oasis town into the administrative, commercial, and religious nexus for political dynasties spanning from modern-day Turkey to Central Asia, the Persian Gulf, and beyond. As it changed hands between succeeding empires, Merv’s population swelled to upwards of 500,000 people during the 12th and 13th centuries, making it possibly the third-largest city in the world at the time. That is until Tolui Khan, the fourth son of the notorious conqueror Genghis Khan, and his Mongol army entered the city in 1221. Tolui promptly ordered his soldiers to kill every single one of Merv’s inhabitants, except 400 relatively lucky artisans who were taken prisoner. In all, it’s said the Mongol destruction of Merv left between 700,000 and 1 million people dead, including several hundred thousand refugees that had been seeking shelter nearby and were swept up in the carnage. The attack signaled the end of Merv’s reign as a major Silk Road trading post and prized capital city. Today, however, Merv’s glory shines once again thanks to the efforts of the Turkmenistan government, dedicated academics, and UNESCO, which declared Ancient Merv a World Heritage Site in 1999 (Turkmenistan’s first ever such honor). The resulting efforts have uncovered thousands of years of history once lost to time, including Bronze Age settlements dating back as far as 2500 BC, as well as numerous fortresses, medieval walls, mausoleums, mosques, and more, all in varying stages of preservation. The sheer size of the city and its ruins makes Merv among the most impressive and complex archaeological sites on Earth, delivering a new accolade for the once-renowned world capital.  Merv can be reached in just under one hour (40 km) from the provincial capital, Mary, which is the largest nearby city. There is no public transportation to or from the archaeological park, so travelers must arrange this independently, and considering the vast size of the site, all visitors are advised to have some form of transportation while exploring Merv itself."
82,Nokhur Cemetery,"Nokhur, Turkmenistan",A cemetery with goat-horn bedecked gravestones.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nokhur-cemetery,"At the cemetery of the isolated village of Nokhur, nearly every grave is marked by a wooden post adorned with the horns of a mountain goat. The goat horns are thought to fight off evil spirits and help the souls of the deceased to ensure a safe passage to heaven. In addition to their appearances at the village cemetery, skulls of mountain goats are found at some of the houses’ doorways of the village as well. The Nokhuris, the mountain tribe of the region, have always considered mountain goats sacred animals for their strength and endurance. The reverence of mountain goats clearly predates Islamic traditions, and though today the Nokhuris are devout Muslims, this part of their ancient belief system has continued to survive. The cemetery of Nokhur is an excellent example of how Islam works in Central Asia. Other than in the Middle East, where the arrival of Islam virtually erased all traces of pre-Islamic religions, in Central Asia certain parts of pre-Islamic belief systems have been incorporated into the younger religion, creating a syncretism often symbolized in the burial rites of local tribes.  Visitors are discouraged from entering the cemetery. However, you can still admire the horned graves respectfully from outside the fence."
83,Wedding Palace,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan","If you want to get married in the White Marble City of Ashgabat, you should do it in this surreal disco ball building.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wedding-palace,"The white marble city of Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, is packed to the borders with strange architecture and puzzling statues. One of the most surreal sights in the city is a government building known as the Wedding Palace, which is topped by a massive, geometrically caged disco ball globe. Built in 2011, the Wedding Palace is a civil building, but it looks as though it was created by a wealthy eccentric. The lower floors of the white and gold structure are star-shaped and stacked in a staggered fashion so that their points do not overlap. Atop the initial floors is a huge globe that features gold maps of Turkmenistan. The oversized disco ball is enclosed by a frame of eight-sided Turkmen stars. Inside, the building delivers essentially what its name would suggest, acting as both the office where newlyweds can legally register their union as well as a venue in which to hold the ceremony. There are 11 floors in the complex, all devoted to getting people hitched. The grandest hall in the structure, known as the “Shamchyrag,” is located smack in the middle of the giant globe. Unique to the Wedding Palace, couples who wish to tie the knot in the opulent castle must have their photo taken in front of a portrait of the President of Turkmenistan, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow. Who better to feature in the pictures of your special day?  It's possible to visit the palace, but you can also admire its unusual architecture from outside. Stop by to see it at night, when it's lit with colored lights. If you're visiting while a wedding is occurring, please be respectful and maintain a courteous distance."
84,Yangykala Canyon,"Balkanabat, Turkmenistan","Few people have ever heard of, let alone visited, one of Turkmenistan’s most impressive natural attractions.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yangykala-canyon,"Turkmenistan is one of the most sparsely populated countries in Asia, and one of the least visited in the world. And out in the far west of this often forgotten country lies a natural attraction that few Turkmen have ever even seen: the Yangykala Canyon, a windblown landscape of colorful canyons and strange formations that stretches some 15 miles across the desert to the Garabogazköl Basin. Yangykala was once underwater, the floor of an ancient ocean that existed millions of years ago. Once that ocean had dried, it left behind a rocky landscape that was slowly eroded by wind and rain, cutting out cliffs and canyons whose walls are now ribbed like the carcasses of strange stranded sea creatures. And then there are the colors: pinks and oranges, reds and yellows, a spectrum of coral shades that give Yangykala Canyon a distinct look. It’s sometimes referred to as the “The Grand Canyon of Central Asia,” but the two are very different. Yangykala had no Colorado River to carve its path, so the actual canyon is far less defined than the Grand Canyon. In many places it looks more like a Martian landscape, pockmarked and chaotic—a place where few humans come and where even the camels look almost lost.  Yangykala Canyon is located in the far northwest of Turkmenistan, about 260 miles northwest of the capital, Ashgabat. You can arrange a three-day tour to the canyon from Ashgabat, or visit it as a day trip from Balkanabat, which is about a four-hour drive from the canyon. The roads are in poor condition, so you need to go by 4x4. There’s also very little in the way of infrastructure or services along the way, so tours must take extra water and fuel in case of emergencies. Once you arrive, you’ll likely be taken to a rock formation known as the “Crocodile’s Mouth” from which you’ll have excellent views of the canyon. To fully appreciate the stunning sunset (and sunrise), you can arrange to camp on a plateau above the canyon. Be prepared, however, as it can be extremely windy and very cold at night."
85,The Walk of Health,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",This harsh mountain path was built as a strange attempt to improve the health of Turkmen citizens.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/walk-of-health,"The Turkmen city of Ashgabat is probably one of the weirdest places on Earth. Much of the capital was the brainchild of the longstanding totalitarian president Saparmurat Niyazov, who has become most famous for the obscure laws he decreed like his ban on dogs, lip-syncing in concerts, and the circus. No less bizarre are the architectural monuments that he built during his 15-year-reign in the capital city, of which the Neutrality Arch is probably the most famous. Another one of the strange creations of Niyazov is the Walk of Health, a concrete stairway that runs alongside the treeless Kopet Dag mountains, aimed to improve the health condition of the citizens. The Walk of Health is actually two walks. The first one has a total length of 8 kilometers, and the other has a total length of 37 kilometers. After it was built, Niyazov ordered all ministers, members of parliament and civil servants to hike the entirety of the longer walk once a year. He also expected the population of the city to do the walk at least once per year as well. Niyazov himself watched his staff start the walk, and later flew in his helicopter to the final stage of the walk to greet them on their successfully completed walk. He argued, that his heart condition would not allow him to do the walk himself. In retrospect, he probably wasn’t lying. He died in 2006 of a heart attack. Despite forcing employees to walk for their health, the forced march was counterproductive. Apparently, walking on a concrete stairway for 22 miles without a source of shade in sight, in one of the more extreme climates on Earth, is a health risk. Ironically, following the annual march, many employees took sick days off of work. To make the walk even slightly plausible, the government has begun to plant trees along the shorter walk."
86,Turkmenbashi's Land of Fairy Tales,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",An eccentric dictator's take on a Turkmen version of Disneyland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/turkmenbashi-s-land-of-fairy-tales,"Turkmenbashi is the name former dictator of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Niyazov, awarded himself when he rose to power following the collapse of the Soviet Union—it literally translates as “Father of the Turkmen.”  For 20 years, Niyazov ruled Turkmenistan with an iron fist, smashing opposition, spending lavishly on personal projects, and creating an elaborate cult of personality. Although Niyazov’s list of eccentricities is long, some of the highlights are his book of poetry, the Rukhnama, that is mandatory reading for all Turkmen students; renaming months of the year after his family members; commissioning a golden statue of himself that rotates to face the sun as it crosses the sky; and bulldozing the homes of hundreds of residents of the capital city, Ashgabat, to build a Turkmen version of Disneyland. Of course, the amusement park was named after himself: Turkmenbashi’s Land of Fairy Tales. The park opened in 2006 at an estimated cost of $50,000,000 and its 54 attractions span some 100 acres (although not all attractions are currently working). While many of the attractions are typical of amusement parks—a Ferris wheel, log ride, small roller coaster, etc.—visitors may begin to notice some odd quirks. There’s a T-rex in a frozen cavern, the deteriorating facade of a fake British Pub, and an island ruled by a giant concrete Gila monster. But even more disconcerting are the animal scenes spread throughout the park. A cobra sticks its lethal head out of the grass, a leopard stalks a pair of deer, two human-sized rabbits with hollowed out faces wait to greet you, and a pack of wolves creeps behind a herd of antelope—you know, kids’ stuff. Turkmenbashi died in December of 2006, shortly after the park opened. Today, visitors rarely find the park at capacity. Instead, the attraction sits listless and decaying, a flat, brown spot in the middle of Ashgabat’s gleaming white marble apartment buildings.  The amusement park is located toward the center of the city. The amusement park is still open, but it's in need of repair. Ask a cab driver to take you to ""Turkmenbashi Disneyland"" and they'll understand where you want to go."
87,Kyrk Gyz Cave,"Koytendag, Turkmenistan",A cave covered with bizarre stalactites of cloth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kyrk-gyz-cave,"In the Köytendag Mountains, a dirt trail leads to the remote Kyrk Gyz Cave. Inside the cave is a something which looks familiar but slowly reveals itself to be bizarre. The ceilings of the cavern is bedecked with a large number of stalactites. However on closer inspection, one can see the stalactites are not stone, but cloth. Local legend has it that anyone who can fling a mud pie with a cloth attached to it to the ceiling of the cave and make it stick, walks away with a wish granted. Kyrk Gyz Cave means “Forty Girls’ Cave”, a name that refers to a local legend of forty girls who once retreated there, in order to avoid rape and murder by bandits. Once in the cave, the forty girls were fed by a mysterious old woman, whose tomb is said to be located in front of the cave. When the bandits discovered them, the Girls prayed to the Gods, who showed them an escape route through the caverns. What that story has to do with placing mud-soaked cloth stripes to the ceiling of the cave however, remains unclear."
88,Arch of Neutrality,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",A dictator's gold statue once rotated to face the sun on a 75-meter high marble tower.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arch-of-neutrality,"While the dictator Saparmurat Niyazov banned gold teeth because they offended him, he adored gold statues of himself. As the ruler of Turkmenistan for over two decades, he gilded the country with his own image in a cult of personality that made Mao look modest. The centerpiece was erected in the capital city of Ashgabat. Called the Arch of Neutrality, it was a 75-meter-high rocket-shaped tower topped with a gold statue of Niyazov, which rotated throughout the day so that his face is always basking in the sun. Built in 1998, the marble-covered monument honored his adoption of neutrality as his official policy, and cost over $12 million to create. Niyazov pronounced himself Turkmenbashi, or “Father of All Turkmen,” and “President for Life.” He exerted extensive control over the country, from defining the age at which a person becomes old to forbidding TV presenters from wearing makeup, as he was having trouble telling the men apart from the women. Despite the country having the world’s fourth-largest gas reserves, its five million people lived mostly destitute, while he constructed more and more lavish monuments. One was the colossal statue of the Ruhnama, the rambling, semi-autobiographical philosophical text Niyazov wrote and made required reading for students and anyone taking the driving test. Not content with a ubiquitous image, he renamed the days of the week, months of the year, a meteorite, a moon crater, a breed of horse, airports, a canal, and a city after himself and members of his family. He even changed the Turkmen word for bread to his late mother’s name (Gurbansoltan). His increasingly personal laws included banning beards, long hair, opera, ballet, and circuses, and made it illegal to play recorded music at weddings. No dissent was tolerated under his authoritarian regime, with human rights groups reporting torture, detentions, house demolitions, forced labor, and exile. In 2006, Niyazov died of heart failure. His successor, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, declared in January 2010 that the Arch of Neutrality would be removed and reassembled on the outskirts of Ashgabat. However, it was not until August of 2010 that the statue was finally removed and reassembled on the outskirts of Ashgabat, surrounded by a huge park. The monument is still open to visitors, who can buy tickets for the elevators into the monument to enjoy city views."
89,Saparmurat Hajji Mosque,"Gokdepe, Turkmenistan",A memorial to the thousands of Turkmen soldiers and civilians who died in a bloody 1881 battle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saparmurat-hajji-mosque,"By 1880, Russia’s calculated, wide-sweeping campaign to conquer Central Asia was nearly complete. One of the last barriers to total domination of the region, however, were the Turkmen (or Tekke Turkomans), a loose confederation of tribes and soldiers without an organized, singular state. Imperial Russia had tried to conquer what is now known as modern-day Turkmenistan a year earlier, launching an attack on the strategically located Goek Tepe fortress, where some 15,000 Turkmen soldiers and 5,000 women and children were positioned. The Russians, who were badly outnumbered, poorly managed, and ill-equipped, soon retreated. Russian forces returned two years later with approximately 6,000 soldiers and a new general commanding the attack. While the Turkmen still greatly outnumbered the Russians, the foreign forces broke through after a 23-day siege by digging a tunnel under one of the fortress’s stone walls and detonating a mine, breaching the defensive lines. The Turkmen were forced to flee and by the time the battle was over, nearly 15,000 Turkmen soldiers and civilians were killed. The Saparmurat Hajji Mosque was built on the orders of the first President of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Atayevich Niyazov, on the site of the former Geok Tepe fortress to commemorate the Turkmen lives lost in this tragic battle—and, in typical post-Soviet authoritarian fashion, to honor Niyazov’s own pilgrimage to Mecca. The mosque subsequently became something of a national symbol for the country’s struggles and adorned the reverse of one of Turkmenistan’s 10,000 manat notes until a new series of currency was introduced in 2005.  The Saparmurat Hajji Mosque is located approximately 20 miles from Ashgabat, Turkmenistan's capital city. While open to the public, the mosque seems to receive very few visitors and is not used as a regular, everyday place of worship. A museum dedicated to the Battle of Geok Tepe is located on the mosque grounds, with entrance costing $5 USD per foreigner."
90,Independence Monument of Turkmenistan,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",Sumptous memorial to a controversial independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/independence-monument-of-turkmenistan,"The Independence Monument of Turkmenistan is one of the largest and most extravagant of its kind in the entire world. Covering an area of more than 80,000 m², the monument sits in the middle of a landscaped park, with numerous water fountains and pools. Considering its extravagance, many visitors forget that it is situated in a city and surrounding region prone to water shortage. 27 comically looking statues of Turkmen heroes surround the centrepiece of the monument and the golden statue of Turkmenistan’s long-running dictator Niyazov, stands proudly in front of what appears to be a dome, with a minaret-like tower rising from its top. The tower is also adorned in gold and features a viewing platform at its top, as well as the oddly-named Museum of Turkmen Values (which is not much else, but a meagre and extremely overpriced ethnographical collection) within the dome below. But what exactly is so excessively celebrated with the monument remains unclear. It depicts the country’s independence as a huge effort, after a hard struggle to finally break free. However many feel that in reality, Turkmenistan was not at all that eager to gain independence when the Soviet Union collapsed. Niyazov (who was already in charge prior to the collapse of the USSR) at first strongly opposed a dissolution of the USSR, and promoted a reformed Soviet Union rather than a large number of independent states. Just when it was obvious that the Soviet Union had come to an end, Niyazov turned 180 degrees, and in an attempt to keep control over politics in Turkmenistan, before being washed away by a revolution, hastily declared the independence of the country. Independence was proclaimed only two months before the final curtain fell for the Soviet Union. The oversized monument seems to proudly memorize a hard-fought independence with Niyazov at the center of the monument and seemingly the Turkmen independence movement, when in fact, he had tried to prevent the country’s independence until he had no other choice.

91,Giant Ruhnama,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",A huge monument to a bizarre book written by Turkmenistan’s longstanding dictator.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/giant-ruhnama,"The former president of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Niyazov, is probably best known for his strange laws, banning everything from lip-syncing to smelly dogs in the capital city. Yet few people know that Niyazov is also a published author, and created a bizarre work known as “the Ruhnama.” The Ruhnama is something of a manifestation of the personality cult of the longstanding Turkmen president. He wrote the Ruhnama (The Book of the Soul) in 2001 as a spiritual guide for the Turkmen nation, and as an attempt to “Turkmenize” the country. The Ruhnama features a weird combination of revisionist history, moral ideals, religious norms, and fairytales. The first volume was issued in 2001, and a second volume was published three years later. Niyazov ordered that reading the book was mandatory at all schools and universities, and that all new government employees should be tested on the book’s contents. He later even made a test on the Ruhnama an essential element of driving tests. Niyazov was once quoted saying, that God himself told him that everyone who has read the book would come directly to heaven. Often compared to Gaddafi’s infamous Green Book in Libya. Since its publishing, the Ruhnama has largely been met with amusement outside the country. Generally seen as an excellent example of the weird, totalist nature of Turkmenistan’s regime, the book shows the country’s bizarre closeness between the state and the head of state. Even Niyazov’s death in 2006, has not put a damper on the popularity of the book in the regime, and Niyazov’s successor still regards the Ruhnama as an essential part of Turkmen heritage. Despite its strange nature, the book has been translated into several languages, mostly sponsored by foreign companies that received large-scale contracts in return. The Giant Ruhnama is but one of the many weird outcomes of the personality cult of Niyazov, which has turned Ashgabat into one of the most politically bizarre places on Earth, adorned with golden statues of the dictator and freed of all “non-Turkmen“ elements, such as theaters. As of now, Niyazov is the only author self-conscious enough to have created a giant monument to his fictitious work.  Ashgabat, Ahal Welayaty, Turkmenistan"
92,Dekhistan Ruins,Turkmenistan,The remains of a medieval city loom in one of the most isolated desert regions of Turkmenistan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dekhistan-ruins,"What’s left of a former flourishing trade city eerily juts out of Turkmenistan’s remote Misrian Valley, the site of medieval Dekhistan. Now in ruins, this area by the Caspian Sea was once a fertile region that supported some 3,000 years of civilization. In its heyday, Dekhistan was a prosperous and strategically located urban center along a caravan route between the ancient realms of Khoresm, an oasis region in Central Asia, and Hyrcania, located southeast of the Caspian Sea in present-day Iran. Dekhistan is believed to have risen in the late 8th century to early 9th century, and comprised nearly 500 acres of fortressed land divided into an old town and a trading and residential district. The capital city of Misrian thrived under the Khwarazmian dynasty, and was notably the site of a medieval mosque with two 80-foot minarets, constructed between the 10th and 12th centuries. The city declined due to the collapse of its advanced irrigation system after extensive deforestation, in conjunction with an invasion by the leader of the Mongol Empire, Genghis Khan. By the 15th century, Dekhistan was completely deserted, and most of the city has been blanketed by sand. The valley has since become arid and infertile, and Dekhistan is now in one of Turkmenistan’s harshest regions. All that remains within the ruins of the city walls are the great mosque’s minarets and portal, as well as bits of former mausoleums and caravanserais.  Tours to the Dekhistan ruins are available for booking through private tour companies."
93,Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque,"Ashgabat, Turkmenistan",The controversial final resting place of the equally controversial first president of Turkmenistan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/turkmenbasy-ruhy-mosque,"The Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque was built by Saparmurat Niyazov, the thoroughly peculiar first president of Turkmenistan. Unlike most mosques, the walls of Türkmenbaşy Ruhy are inscribed, controversially, with scriptures from not only the Quran but also the Ruhnama, Niyazov’s own spiritual guide to life. During the last half-century, few presidents have come close to the sheer weirdness of Niyazov, a repressive dictator who ruled over the sparsely populated country from 1985 until his death in 2006. The leader foisted a long list of bizarre decrees upon his country, including banning lip syncing at public concerts, banishing dogs from the capital city, Ashgabat (citing their “unappealing odor”), and outlawing opera, ballet, and circuses because they were “decidedly unturkmen-like.” He also supposedly banned beards, the use of makeup by television presenters, and gold teeth (he recommended that his people chew on bones instead). Oh, and apparently he did away with the Turkmen word for bread and renamed it gurbansoltan, after his mother. So, yes, Saparmurat Niyazov was eccentric. He was also semi-illiterate, but that didn’t stop him writing a new spiritual guide and a kind of origin story for Turkmenistan. The booked was called the Ruhnama (The Book of the Soul), and it was a rambling mess full of dubious claims. Still, many of his countrymen—89 percent of them being Muslim—ended up reading the Ruhnama, simply because they didn’t have much choice in the matter. Niyazov had copies placed in every school and library across the nation. He made reading it a compulsory part of the national driving test and required reading in schools and universities. Then in 2006, despite earlier claiming it was not a religious text, Niyazov explained how he had talked to God and could now confirm that anyone who read the Ruhnama three times would be guaranteed a place in heaven. Niyazov was obsessed with his book (there’s a giant statue of it in Ashgabat), so much so that he elevated it to the same level as the Quran when he built the Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque—the largest mosque in Central Asia—in 2004. The vast prayer room can hold 10,000 pilgrims, with 7,000 men on the main floor and 3,000 women on the second level. Beneath the mosque is an underground parking area with a capacity for 400 cars. The walls of the mosque were inscribed with verses from both the Quran and the Ruhnama. This, unsurprisingly, outraged many Muslims, who believed that passages from the Quran should be given far more reverence than Niyazov’s modern book of rambling moral guidance, and should not appear alongside each other. Even more incendiary was one particular quotation inscribed prominently on the entry arch to the mosque, which reads “The Ruhnama is the holiest book and the Quran is the book of Allah.” Saparmurat Niyazov, however, wasn’t the kind of person who paid much attention to the trifling complaints of the world’s religious leaders. He left his mosque as it was, resplendent in Italian marble and gold, along with the nearby mausoleum, which is a miniature version of the mosque, built in preparation of his own death. He died in 2006, two years after the mosque was built, and now rests in his mausoleum, surrounded by the words of the Quran and his own hallowed Ruhnama.  The Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque (also known as the Gypjak Mosque) is located just off the M37 highway in the village of Gypjak—Saparmurat Niyazov’s hometown—which lies about 7 miles northwest of Ashgabat city center. It’s also not far from Ashgabat International Airport. The mausoleum is guarded by soldiers and is rarely open to the public."
94,Shah-i-Zinda Necropolis,"Samarkand, Uzbekistan",The Avenue of Mausolea is a series of grand palatial tombs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shah-i-zinda-necropolis,"Shah-I-Zinda is one of the oldest and longest-running examples of a continually constructed historic site in the world. It was established with a single religious monument over 1,000 years ago.  Various temples, mausoleums, and buildings were continually added throughout the ensuing centuries, from approximately the 11th century to the 19th. The result is a fascinating cross-reference of various architectural styles, methods, and decorative craftsmanship as they have changed throughout a millennium of work. The complex was founded to mark a site of legend, where mythology states Muhammed’s cousin, Kusam ibn Abbas, was buried. Like most legends, the story has persevered through time, but it is more rare for such historic sites to have endured as long, through centuries of war and weather, progress and expansion. It may in fact be the extensive additions and re-imaginings that have kept the site sacred and respected. That, and the fact that Shah-I-Zinda is a necropolis, housing the remains of numerous people, both famous and unknown, has allowed the various constructions to remain intact for so long. This respect for the existing structures and the continual improvement of the buildings has lead to an interesting multi-tiered design, where layers of history and architecture intertwine between staircases, archways, and dusty paths. One century intersects with another over the course of mere steps at Shah-I-Zinda. Its combination of hallowed ground and continual improvement has allowed this ever-expanding complex to remain fresh and vibrant in the eyes of both citizens and government, allowing it to be preserved and protected throughout the years."
95,Moynaq,"Muynak District, Uzbekistan","Once a bustling fishing port, this semi-ghost town is now more than 90 miles away from the shore.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moynaq-ghost-town-desert,"Moynaq is a city, surrounded by the desert of western Uzbekistan. At first glance, this seems to be one of the many Soviet cities that fell into decline after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But upon closer inspection, one can’t help but notice that there is something strange about Moynaq. All over the city, displays of fish can be seen on murals, mosaics, posters bleached from the sun, and even on the entrance sign of the city. A monument of a fishing boat sits in front of the government building and a number of closed fish cannery factories dot the landscape - but there is not a single body of water in sight. Moynaq was indeed once an important fishing town, but the water the city was once located on receded a long time ago. It was the ecological disaster of the Aral Sea, which turned this fishing port into a sunbaked town surrounded by the desert. The shrinking of the Aral Sea is considered one of the most severe anthropogenic ecological disasters of all time. Once one of the world’s four largest lakes, the Aral Sea has shrunk to 10 % of its former size since the 1960s. No other city around the Aral Sea was affected by this disaster more severely than Moynaq. The water’s edge is now more than 150km away from the city, and the former fishing fleet of Moynaq sits in a surreal setting in the middle of the desert. It is a bizarre, almost post-apocalyptic experience to view Bactrian camels roam around the rusting ships. When the lake began to recede, the fisherman at first followed the water’s edge, but after a while, the rising salinity levels of the shrinking lake killed off the entire fish population. The ships were simply left in the middle of the desert. Since then, several ships have been collected from the desert and now rest in a “cemetery of ships” at the edge of town. Since fishing was no longer a source of income for the city, the population began to constantly decline for more than three decades. For the last 10 years, oil and gas has been found in the old sea bed of the Aral Sea, and lots of drilling rigs now occupy the empty desert around Moynaq. Nowadays, the town seems to be more alive, with lots of new constructions and buildings in the main street. Most of the remaining population is involved in the cotton industry of the larger region which, ironically, was responsible for the Aral Sea disaster in the first place. The disaster of the Aral Sea could easily be undone, if the rivers that once fed the sea – most notably the Amu Darya river – were no longer diverted to irrigate the cotton fields. Alas, since the economy of Uzbekistan is rather weak, and alternative sources of income in the poor west of the country are not available, a refilling of the Aral Sea seems highly unlikely."
96,Ulugh Beg Observatory,"Samarkand, Uzbekistan",Light still pours into the ruins of this ancient Islamic observatory.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ulugh-beg-observatory,"For nearly half a millennium, the remains of one of the greatest observatories ever built lay hidden in Central Asia. A product of one Muslim prince’s devotion to science, the observatory was the site of the world’s most advanced astronomical studies for three decades before being leveled by religious extremists. Located near the city of Samarkand in present-day Uzbekistan, Ulugh Beg Observatory was built in the 1420s by the Timurid ruler Ulugh Beg, grandson of emperor Timur the Lame (Tamerlane). Known more for his scholarly pursuits than his governance skills, Beg proved unpopular as a ruler. Beg first took control of Transoxiana (a region comprised mostly of modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and southwest Kazakhstan) after his father’s death in 1447. Only two years into his campaign, and after losing several battles to neighboring rival kingdoms, Beg was taken to trial by his own son, Abd al Latif. Beg’s punishment for his ineptitude was a mandatory pilgrimage to Mecca, but his journey ended quickly, as he was beheaded just outside of Samarkand by an assassin hired by his son. Following his death, Beg’s observatory was razed to the ground, and the dozens of skilled scientists who worked there were driven away. For centuries, the site fell into relative obscurity, and the exact location of the observatory was known by few. In 1908, however, the Russian archaeologist Vassily Vyatkin uncovered the remains and with it a rich tale of the ancient astronomer’s work. (Today Vyatkin is buried on site according to his own wishes.) In its prime, the Ulugh Beg Observatory consisted of a three-story cylindrical building constructed around three enormous astronomical instruments. The main instrument, which remains mostly intact, was a monumental meridian arc, now called the Fakhrī sextant. This curving stone arch once measured 40 meters tall and was used by astronomers to measure the angle of elevation of bright celestial objects. Light would pour in through a window and fall on a specific point on the arch that depended on the height of the object in the sky. With this instrument, Beg and his fellow astronomers could precisely determine the length of the year, the time of local noon each day, and even the angle between Earth’s rotational axis and the plane of its orbit around the sun. In fact, the astronomers of Ulugh Beg Observatory measured the length of the year to within 25 seconds of the actual value, and determined the axial tilt of the Earth so accurately that their number falls within today’s accepted range of values. They were able to accomplish what they did because the meridian arc was the largest instrument of its kind ever built. With such great size, the meridian arc could achieve a resolution of one six-hundredth of a degree, which is equivalent to the size of an American penny viewed over a half a kilometer away. Perhaps Ulugh Beg’s greatest achievement, though, was a star catalogue containing at least 1,018 stars and their locations in the night sky. Compiled almost 200 years before the advent of telescopes, the remarkably thorough catalog almost perished with the observatory, but escaped into the hands of astronomer Ali-Kushji, who went on to publish the great work."
97,Walls of Itchan Kala,"Xiva, Uzbekistan",Ancient barriers wrap around what was once an important stop along the Silk Road.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/walls-of-itchan-kala,"Located in the city of Khiva, Itchan Kala (also spelled Ichan Qa’la) was an important stepping stone along the Silk Road. Coming from the West, it was the last place for caravans to stock up before tackling the desert. Like most cities in the region, the original settlement consisted of an inner and an outer part. Incha Qala was the inner, fortified section of this city. With such a steady stream of visitors, it’s hardly surprising to find that the fortified walls were built to stretch upwards of more than 30 feet high. The oldest section of the barrier, which was built using mud bricks, dates back to the fifth century. The walls once featured four gates that faced the four directions. The crenellated wall is punctuated with semicircular towers and together they create mesmerizing wave patterns that have captured the imagination of artists through the years. The beautiful walls aren’t the fortified city’s only treasure. As testimony to the geopolitical importance it once had, Ichan Kala is an impressive sight to behold. Its history goes back millennia, but the buildings remaining standing are mainly from the beginning of the 19th century. In all, there are 51 monuments and 250 buildings nestled within its walls. Among the highlights are Djuma Mosque (also the oldest structure in Ichan Kala), Oq Mosque, Alla-Kulli-Khan madrasah, Pahlavol Mahmoud Mausoleum, and various caravanserais and bazaars, all exquisite examples of ancient Central Asian Islamic architecture. Being a frontier city, ancient Khiva achieved a respectable degree of notoriety, with marauders and slave traders coming and going all year round. If by the beginning of the 20th century, Khiva’s fame began fading, the advent of the Soviet regime delivered the coup-de-grace. Martial surveillance ensured that no lawless activities would be carried out. So much so that the city was all but forgotten, and so was Ichan Kala. Today, people in Khiva look at Ichan Kala as a beacon from a grandiose past from which they all derive.  Most people arrive at the regional capital of Urgench via train, plane, or bus. From there, you can take a taxi to Khiva (it’s about a 40-minute drive). Be prepared to negotiate the price of the ride. Itchan Kala is relatively small and is easily walkable. You can wander within the old city at any time. Some of the higher vantage points offer breathtaking views of the sunset."
98,Kalyan Minaret,"Bukhara, Uzbekistan","This ""tower of death"" has acted as an observatory, a religious hub, and an executioner's lair.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kalyan-minaret,"The Kalyan Minaret in Bukhara, Uzbekistan, like the desert that surrounds it, has a history of both beauty and death. Nicknamed the “Tower of Death,” the 48-meter baked-brick tower was constructed in 1127 to call the Muslim faithful in the city to prayer five times a day. With an ornate gallery at its top, and glazed designs etched into the exterior, the tower was known for its impressive dimensions and its artistry. When Genghis Khan arrived around 100 years after the minaret’s construction, local legend has it that Khan looked from the base of the spire to the top, and the steep angle caused his hat to fall off. Admiring the audacity of the tower, Khan ordered the spire spared from the destruction that his army visited on the rest of the city. In the 16th century, the Kaylan mosque and Mir-i Arab Madrasah were built around it, and it is now the center piece of the Po-I Kalyan mosque complex. The tower has been used as an observatory, and, during times of war, it served as a lookout to watch for invading armies. Its most famous, and startlingly recent, use was for public execution, where those condemned to die were thrown from the rotunda at the top to the stone courtyard below. The last known execution took place as late as 1920, during the Russian Revolution."
99,Vozrozhdeniye Island,"Kantubek, Uzbekistan",Former island in the Aral Sea used to be a top-secret Russian bio-weapons facility.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vozrozhdeniye-island-1,"Imagine an American-centric, worst nightmare portrayal of the peak of the Cold War. It probably looks a little like hazard-suited Soviets, tinkering with terrifying diseases we long thought were extinct. And that probably looks a lot like Vozrozhdeniye Island just a few decades ago. In 1948, the Soviets opened up a tiny laboratory on the island in the Aral Sea. Before the Aral Sea began to disappear, top-secret work was conducted by teams of scientists researching the weaponization of some of the most deadly diseases humankind has ever known. Over the next 40 years, the Soviets conducted open air tests on smallpox, anthrax and the bubonic plague on the island, hoping its isolation would keep the deadly illnesses from escaping. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the island facility was abandoned, and the remnants of the weaponized diseases were buried quickly. As the island slowly became desert and the sea slowly disappeared due to Soviet irrigation projects, the once isolated island became a part of the mainland. Over concerns that deadly pathogens could still be alive on the island, a team of Russians went to the once active facility site to decontaminate the land. According to their report in 2001, everything was clear. However, a conflicting report in 2005 showed that there were still remnants of the facility including test tubes for conducting experiments on animals, which preserved the chance of deadly diseases such as anthrax still being present in the area.   There is a gravel road from the Uzbek town of Moqnay that leads to the former base and city on the island."
100,Elliq-Qala,"Beruni, Uzbekistan","These ""50 Fortresses"" have been unearthed in the ancient oasis of Khwarezm.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elliq-qala,"Not far from Khiva, Uzbekistan, the desert oasis of Khwarezm offers a literal treasure trove of archeological and anthropological history. Dotting the vast desert of what was once ancient Khwarezm are the ruins of countless forts and towns collectively known as the Golden Ring. Less officially but more descriptively, the area is known as Elliq-Qala, which translates literally to “Fifty Forts.” Though only 20 distinct ruin sites have been found to date, this nickname may prove prescient, as new ruins are being discovered (and rediscovered) all the time. And even though the ruins technically do not yet live up to the promise of their name, they still combine to make the area of Khwarezm one of the largest and most fascinating areas of ruin on the planet. More than two millennia ago, people were drawn to Khwarezm for much the same reason they are today – it’s a natural oasis in a region of stark desert, feeding from the Aral Sea and providing a more temperate climate and robust vegetation patterns. For this reason, numerous competing tribes built cities and surrounded them with forts for protection in the area. Visiting Khwarezm today, all that remains of many sites are the foundations of city walls and buildings, only hinting at the larger structures they once formed and protected. Ramparts, basements, and collapsed underground tunnels leading from city to city, or city to fort, are still being unearthed, meaning Elliq-Qala is one of the more exciting archeological sites of the current era. Although the Golden Ring of ruins are now deserted, with modern Khwarezm settlements located a fair distance away, one can only imagine how bustling the now-empty desert once was with trade and war, travelers and settlers, while examining their society’s dusty remnants."
101,Khan's Palace,"Kokand, Uzbekistan",Final palace complex of the last of 29 Kokand rulers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khan-s-palace,"Built in 1871, this huge and magnificent palace complex was constructed in the traditions of Central Asian architecture. Visitors will find, as one knowledgeable about such things might expect to, a high portal in the middle of the complex, four minarets, a large entrance, and other distinctive elements. This palace once served as the seventh home of the last ruler of Kokand Khanate, Khudoyar Khan. Khudoyar Khan was, according to historical records, the last Khan of 29 to serve in Kokand within just 150 years. He took the throne in 1845 when he was 12 years old and became the brother-in-law of Mingboshi Musulmonkul, a powerful military leader. Surrounded by a large carved stone wall, Khan’s Palace consists of 119 rooms organized around seven small courtyards. All together, the palace takes up four acres. Building such an enormous complex required 16,000 people and 80 masters in various fields. Those workers used 1,000 carts to haul materials around the complex as they worked on building the structure. None of them, however, wanted to be there; the people were driven to the area by force and made to work in unbearably harsh conditions. Today, the palace serves as a museum of local history, with exhibits detailing the past and present of the surrounding region, Kokand.

102,Chilpik Tower of Silence,"Nukus, Uzbekistan",The ruins of an ancient Zoroastrian Tower of Silence believed to be the earliest example of the traditional funerary practice.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chilpik-tower-of-silence-dakhma,"Situated on the banks of the Amu Darya river in the Chilpik (also spelled Shilpik or Shilpiq) region of Karakalpakstan, an autonomous territory of Uzbekistan, is an ancient Zoroastrian Tower of Silence thought to be the earliest example of the traditional funerary ritual, constructed somewhere between the 1st century BCE and 1st century CE. Towers of Silence, also called dakhma, are a traditional excarnation ritual practiced in the Zoroastrian faith dating back thousands of years. Zoroastrians believed that after death a body was at risk of becoming contaminated and made impure by demons. To prevent this, corpses of the deceased were left atop a tower exposed to the elements and birds of prey which would purify the body, after which the bones would be placed in ossuaries nearby. This practice was believed to be the least harmful form of interment. The ancient Chilpik dakhma, a 49-foot-tall circular structure situated on top of a mound of sand rising out of the desert, has become a popular symbol in Karakalpakstan, and even is even found on its coat of arms. This dakhma is particularly significant as local legend suggests the region around it is where Zarathushtra, the founder of Zoroastrianism, began to compose the religion’s ancient scriptures, the Avesta. The Chilpik Tower of Silence remained in full use until the Arab invasion of Khwarezm in the 7th century, and possibly up until 10th century. After burials ceased to be performed, the structure was used as a signal tower."
103,Tomb of Daniel at Samarkand,"Samarkand, Uzbekistan",18m long sarcophagus of a constantly growing dead prophet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tomb-daniel-samarkand,"Five domes adorn the long structure that holds an 18m long sarcophagus, reputedly holding the remains of the Old Testament prophet Daniel, revered by Muslims, Jews and Christians alike – although only Christians regard him as a prophet. This is not the only place that claims to be the final resting place of Daniel. The most widely accepted of these places is in Susa, Iran. Even beyond Uzbekistan and Iran, a couple of cities in Iraq also lay claim to be the final resting place of Daniel – which, since the Bible places Daniel in Babylon, in modern day Iraq, at the time of his death, is not too far-fetched either. Samarkand seems to be the odd one among the places, that argue to be the real final resting place of Daniel. As legend has it, Timur (Tamerlane) tried to conquer modern day Syria, but successively failed – apparently because the body of Daniel was preventing his success. When he finally succeeded, it is claimed, that he ordered the body to be buried at Samarkand for good luck. Immediately after he was buried, a natural spring started to sprout, which, naturally, is regarded to have healing powers. But local lore goes even further, stating that the body of Daniel was continually growing at a rate of around 5cm a year. If this was true, the body of Daniel would by now have a length of more than 125m, rather than “just“ 18m, since he died approximately 2500 years ago. However the truth behind the corpse’s growth is that Timur was paranoid about grave robbers and extended the grave to make it harder for potential robbers to pillage the bones."
104,Fergana Valley,"Ulugnor District, Uzbekistan",One of the most ethnically diverse spots on the planet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fergana-valley,"A geographical territory that is completely surrounded by foreign territory, an enclave is often a place filled with political and cultural complications. For this reason and others, most governments have avoided creating enclaves - or have avoided allowing them to exist - and there are a relatively small number today. Many of them are found in the Fergana Valley, a region in Central Asia where Taikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan all meet. Just some of the enclaves found in this region include Barak, a small Kyrgyz village surrounded by Uzbekistan; So’x and Shohimardon and the two tiny territories of Qal’acha and Khalmion, all surrounded by Kyrgyzstan; the Tajik village of Sarvan in Uzbekistan; and the Tajik village of Vorukh and the tiny piece of land known as Kairagach, both in Kyrgyzstan. Most of these are just tiny villages with small populations - most have less than 1,000 people - but they have survived because those populations consider it important to maintain their cultural heritage and insist on teaching the traditions of their ancestors. The valley’s history stretches back more than 2,300 years, when the population settled there was first conquered by Greco-Bactrian invaders from the west. As a spot along the Northern Silk Road, this area was converted by Muslim invaders from the west before the Russian Empire took the valley at the end of the 19th century, adding it to the Soviet Union. The three regional states mentioned earlier all gained independent from the Soviet Union in 1991 and the residents have been struggling with cultural conflict ever since. Many of the enclaves don’t even subsist using the same methods. This area is incredibly fertile and diverse, with cotton cultivation playing a large role in the local economy as well as leatherwork, stock breeding, and mining. Deposits of iron, coal, sulfur, rock-salt, napththa, gypsum, and more have been found in this area, which has also proven able to support the cultivation of various grains, fruits, and vegetables."
105,Central Asian Plov Center,"Tashkent, Uzbekistan",Giant cauldrons overflow with Uzbekistan's favorite rice dish at this cavernous dining hall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/central-asian-plov-center,"Plov is a common dish throughout Central Asia. Uzbeks in particular, however, have made it into a uniquely national obsession. This obsession is celebrated in full force at the Central Asian Plov Center in Tashkent. Typical plov consists of rice, carrots, and meat cooked together, but every corner of Uzbekistan makes its own version and claims to have the best one. Not only is plov an important source of nourishment for the Uzbeks, but it also represents hospitality, community, and identity; it’s not uncommon to see it served at weddings or festivals. At large gatherings, plov chefs, called osphaz, can prepare a giant meal for up to 1,000 people from a single cauldron (kazan). The menu at the Plov Center is simple; there’s plov, salad, and drinks. Customers get to choose how much rice, how much meat, and whether or not they’d like an egg or kazy (horse sausage, similar to Kazakh shuzhuk). Each batch is cooked in a giant, wood-fired kazan, then scooped onto customers’ plates in the cavernous dining hall. A few tourists have started to find their way to Plov Center, but it’s still an institution dedicated to a dish that is as Uzbek as it can be.  The metro station closest to Central Asian Plov Center is Habib Abdullayev. It is right next to the TV tower that can be used as a landmark to find it. Get there before noon for the best selection."
106,"""The Bug Pit"" at Zindon Prison","Bukhara, Uzbekistan",Where Stoddart and Connolly suffered in the infamous Bug Pit.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zindon-prison,"In 1842, the British soldiers Connolly and Stoddart were executed in front of the Ark Fortress in Bukhara. It was the grim finale to years of torture (for Stoddart - four years) in the Zindon prison located within the fortress. However, the most famous resident of Zindon was not a person, but a place: “the Bug Pit,” a four meter deep hole, accessible only by rope. This bleak pit is where Connolly and Stoddart spent their time in Zindon, while guards poured scorpions, bugs, and rodents onto their heads. Stoddart suffered three years in the prison – more than one of which he whiled away in the Bug Pit - before Conolly was thrown down to join him; ironically, Conolly had the unfortunate fate of being sent to Bukhara to release Stoddart. They spent a year together in the Bug Pit, before the Emir finally had them executed. The soldiers were victims of what can only be described as extreme blunders of sociopolitical etiquette. Stoddart was tasked with delivering a letter of reassurance to the Emir of Bukhara, stating that the British had no intention of continuing their invasion of Afghanistan into his kingdom. However, Stoddart had ridden into the castle on horseback rather than walking, and arrived without a gift for Nasrullah Khan, the Emir and an extremely brutal figure. Nicknamed “The Butcher,” Nasrullah was outraged at these indignities, and viewed the British Empire as a weakened nation after their defeat in Afghanistan.  Regarding the two Brits as worthless, he had them jailed, tortured, and executed. The British Empire did not respond. Today, the Bug Pit is but one of many gruesome places in the Zindon prison, in which mannequins eerily portray the conditions of imprisonment. Much of the rest of the enormous Ark fortress was destroyed by the Red Army’s invasion in 1920, thereby putting an end to continual inhabitation of the fortress for more than 1,400 years."
107,Amir Timur (Tamerlane) Museum,"Tashkent, Uzbekistan","Looking for a unifying history, Uzbekistan finds its answer in a 14th Century Turco-Mongol conqueror... despite the fact he wasn't Uzbek.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amir-timur-tamerlane-museum,"It can be difficult for a country created out of whole cloth to find a unifying identity. Such is the case with Uzbekistan. One of two doubly landlocked countries in the world – a landlocked country surrounded entirely landlocked countries, the other being Liechtenstein – Uzbekistan as a national idea did not exist until the Soviets created it in the 1920s, complicating the process of state formation in Uzbekistan today. (The soviets were also responsible for environmental disaster within Uzbekistan such as the draining of the Aral Sea.) Uzbekistan officially came into existence in 1991, after the break-up of the Soviet Union, and holds within its borders a mix of ethnic groups, including Uzbeks, Russians, Tajiks, Kazakhs, Karakalpaks and Tatars. In order to help unify the diverse population held together by its soviet created borders the new Uzbek state looked to pre-Russian Central Asian past for unifying national myths, in order to encourage a cohesive Uzbek identity. The figure that emerged out of this search through Central Asian history was the highly controversial figure of Amir Temur (Tamerlane). A fourteenth-century conqueror of Western, South and Central Asia, Amir Temur’s main qualifications was that his huge empire was located in the modern Uzbek state. He founded the Timurid Empire and Timurid dynasty (1370–1405) in Central Asia. Central Asia blossomed economically and culturally under his reign. At the same time, Baghdad, Damascus, Delhi and other Arab, Persian, Indian and Turkic cities were sacked and destroyed. Ironically, the unifying figure of Uzbekistan wasn’t Uzbek at all and instead belonged to the Barlas, a Turko-Mongolian tribe. In fact, it was the fall of the Timurids that allowed the Uzbek Khaqanate to gain power and form the basis of modern Uzbeks. Nonetheless, Timur has been officially recognized as a national hero of Uzbekistan, because his imperial capital was located in Samarkand. His name has replaced Marx’s and Lenin’s on street signs and government buildings all over Uzbekistan. Opened in 2006, the Amir Timur Museum is one of the newest museums in Tashkent. It was established to commemorate the 660th birthday of Amir Timur. The museum’s blue dome and ornate interior reference Central Asian Islamic architecture. The museum collection consists of ancient manuscripts, paintings, and engravings of Timurid’s age. The collection also includes a 14th century Quran from Syria. Amir Timur’s military career is reconstructed in a celebratory manner. The gardens surrounding the museum contain a statue of Timur on horseback and some prominent fountains. Lingering Soviet influence is acutely felt in the Amir Temur museum. Murals reminiscent of social realism decorate the lobby of the museum. The museum also features an exhibit on president Islam Karimov. Karimov came to power under the Soviet regime and has had a firm grip on the presidency since 1990.  Located in the center of Tashkent."
108,Seattle Peace Park,"Tashkent, Uzbekistan",Touching displays of wishes for peace from the Cold War era.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/seattle-peace-park,"In retrospect, one could argue that during the Cold War era, the world was much easier to comprehend than it is today. Today, the borders between friend and enemy are blurred, wars are no longer restricted to political borders, and armed civilians often pose a bigger threat than armies. In the Cold War era – while certainly not a time of peace, the political sphere was subject to a number of unspoken rules, and both sides acted accordingly to prevent the ever-present threat of global warfare that constantly lingered above the world. Seattle Peace Park is a heartwarming reminder of the Cold War from children’s perspectives. Along the main alley of the park (officially known as Babur Park), ceramic tiles along the way display hopes of peace and a better future. These tiles were made in the 1980s by schoolchildren from Seattle, hence the unusual inofficial name of the park. The 10,000 tiles of the park are incredibly moving because of their simple, yet timeless message to favor peace and friendship over war and distrust. Seattle and Tashkent have – rather astonishingly – been twin cities since 1973, long before the relations of the superpowers began to thaw. The partnership between both cities began only five years after the Soviet intervention during the Prague Spring in 1968. It was the first city partnership between a U.S. city and a Soviet city and it has continued until today. Update as of August 2019: The Babur Recreation Park is currently closed for remodeling. While it is possible to walk through the area, most of the attractions are closed or in a state of semi-repair. Update as of July 2021: The park remains closed."
109,Yodgorlik Silk Factory,"Margilan, Uzbekistan",Witness traditional silk production in the Uzbek city that's been a hub of sericulture for over a thousand years.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yodgorlik-silk-factory,"Since medieval times, the ancient city of Margilan in Uzbekistan’s Fergana Valley has been known for its fabled “Khan-atlas,” or “royal silk.” Its factories still produce the famous handmade silk today, and at least one of them continues to use age-old methods passed down from generation to generation. Ringed by the Tien Shan mountains to the north, the Gissar Alai to the south, and watered by the Syr Darya river and its tributaries, the beauty of this fertile valley is legendary. Babur, the founder of the mighty Moghul Empire that ruled much of the Indian subcontinent for over 300 years, was born in Fergana Valley and eulogized its beauty in his memoirs. From the reign of the Chinese Han dynasty onwards, the region was traversed by ancient trade routes from China. Caravans laden with silks, teas, and spices came through the mountain passes and crossed the valley, heading to destinations in the Middle East and beyond. Bales of lustrous, richly hued Margilani silk were certainly among the precious merchandise picked up by the caravans on their journey westward. The specifics of how the Margilani people acquired the secrets of sericulture, as practiced by the ancient Chinese, are not known. But given that the market towns and caravanserais along the silk routes not only facilitated trade but also allowed for cross-cultural interactions and the dissemination of ideas, it’s easy to see how the transfer of knowledge may have happened with the right inducement. Over a thousand years later, Margilan’s “Yodgorlik” factory (which means “souvenir” in Uzbek) still uses these traditional methods of silk production. A tour of the factory usually begins at the venerable 140-year-old mulberry tree. From there you can see each step of the process, which is all done by hand: boiling the cocoons of the silkworms and extracting the silk thread, spinning and dyeing the silk, using vegetable dyes and sometimes crushed minerals, and lastly weaving the colorful ikat fabric on traditional looms. Since Fergana Valley is also a major producer of cotton, the Yodgorlik factory also produces a fabric that is a blend of cotton and silk, called “Adras.”  Driving from Tashkent to the city of Fergana is recommended; Margilan is less than a half hour away from Fergana. Though the drive may take up to six hours, including pit stops, the scenery is breathtaking and not to be missed. Come springtime, the mountainsides are ablaze with red tulips, which grow wild in these regions."
110,Hang Son Doong,"Xuân Trạch, Vietnam","World's largest cave was only discovered in 1991, and now offers tours to the public.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hang-son-doong,"Hang Son Doong — which roughly translates to Mountain River Cave — is the world’s largest cave and it is so large that it could hold a modern-day skyscraper inside of its caverns, and has its own small jungle. Located near the Vietnam-Laos border, the cave was found by a local man named Ho-Khanh in 1991. The locals, it is said, were too afraid of the cave to go exploring because of the sound coming from the fast-moving underground river, as well as the huge vertical drop. In 2009, a group of scientists from the British Cave Research Association began an extensive survey of the cave’s depths. According to Howard Limbert, the man leading the survey, the cave is five times larger than Phong Nha, which once held the title of the largest in Vietnam. The biggest chamber, his team found, is over five kilometers long and 200 meters tall. The jungle found inside of the cave has formed underneath a collapsed roof in one of the caverns. After the roof collapsed, enough light spilled into the cavern that vegetation was able to creep in slowly from outside. As the vegetation took hold, larger and larger plants began to grow, and now hornbills, flying foxes, and monkeys dwell in its branches. In 2013, public visits started to be offered by Oxalis that offer the chance to spend days inside exploring, as well as camping, in this massive cave.  As it turns out there is another larger cave in the area recently discovered, but kept a secret by the locals as this cave is such a boon to tourism. On the lower end tours start around $3,000 USD and reach upwards of $5,000."
111,Hồ Thuỷ Tiên,"tx. Hương Thủy, Vietnam","Vietnam's feral abandoned water park offers access to a post-apocalyptic funscape, now with fewer crocodiles.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ho-thuy-tien,"Opened in 2004 at a price tag of approximately three million USD, the Ho Thuy Tien water park opened its gates to the public when it was only partially completed. Bankrolled by Company Hue Tourism, debuting a half-finished dream turned out to be a bad business move; but, in an odd turn of events, ever since its closure, the park has provided Hue’s tourism industry with an off-the-books boon they never could have seen coming. In the heyday of Ho Thuy Tien, adults and children alike were magnetically attracted to the park’s signature giant, three-story-tall dragon aquarium. Rising from the lake at the park’s center, manta rays and sharks lined the walls of the interior staircase, built to resemble a dragon’s rib cage. On all sides of the dragon’s bowels were aquarium tanks full of live fish and crocodiles. These crocs would later rival the dragon as superstars of the abandoned park, as well. Even with an excited population of park-goers flocking to Ho Thuy Tien, drawn by the promise of cool waters and good times, something was amiss. Within just a few years, the business continued to experience problems. After it shuttered, plans to resurrect the park from its fiscal troubles by turning it into an eco-park swirled throughout Hue’s local media as recently as 2013. Instead, those revitalization plans died on the table, leaving the park to become a legendary destination for travelers to the region. Located ten kilometers outside of town, Ho Thuy Tien now exists in a sort of purgatory between worlds. When business was booming, the park was an easy-to-find destination, listed in guidebooks; no longer the case, Ho Thuy Tien is now – justifiably or not – a sort of badge of honor among travelers, with its coordinates passed from one another by word of mouth, though it’s just as easily Google-able. Located eight kilometers out of town, the park isn’t exactly easy to get to, but once there, visitors may be surprised to find a quasi-guard posted at the gate collecting “admission” to the site. Sometimes there’s even a refreshment cart in operation inside the abandoned park. The sight of a gigantic dragon laying claim to his lake is made more stunning for its crumbling state. The abandoned amphitheater where hundreds of spectators witnessed shows before the fun died is as eerie as expected, and the three remaining water slides rise through creeping woods, and the specter of abandoned crocodiles once kept alive by visiting backpackers still looms. Thankfully the latter, pitiable case seems to have been resolved in recent months, after repeated calls to WWF and PETA, until the Vietnamese government finally transported them to a proper wildlife park. Still, it seems best to avoid all water in the park both for reasons of sanitation and potential rogue chomping.  Best found by asking around, or locating via ""dropped pin"" coordinates. Be prepared to ""tip"" the guard at the gate for unfettered access to the park. However, this may not always be possible, in which case it's best observed from a distance."
112,Golden Bridge,"Hòa Phú, Vietnam",This spectacular bridge supported by two gigantic hands looks like something out of a fantasy universe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golden-bridge,"Pictures of the fantastic Golden Bridge outside of Da Nang went viral as soon as they appeared online. This unique structure, backdropped by beautiful scenery, makes for a stunning sight, as if it was plucked from a fantasy world. The giant hands supporting the bridge symbolize something divine, mythical, or godlike. It does look as though they are lifting the bridge as a gift from the ground. The bridge’s principle architect, Vu Viet Anh, has even said that the goal of the design was to “invoke the sensation of walking along a thread stretching through the hands of God.” Building the footbridge was an engineering challenge in order to not damage the cliff below and make the structure blend in with the forest around it. The hands are supported by frames modeled after anatomical structures and covered with decorative fiberglass. The position of each finger was carefully chosen to invoke the desired effect. It’s no secret that the construction of the Golden Bridge is a part of a $2 billion investment to lure more tourists to the area. With a bridge this spectacular in such a stunning landscape, it might just succeed.  The Golden Bridge (Cau Vang in Vietnamese) is the newest addition to the Sun World Ba Na Hills amusement park, located about 18 miles west of Da Nang. The walkway is at the top of the Ba Na Hills, accessible by a 20-minute cable car ride up the hill. The entrance fee to the amusement park includes the cable car to the Golden Bridge. The walkway is 3,280 feet above sea level and nearly 500 feet long."
113,Hanoi's Train Street,"Hanoi, Vietnam",Twice a day a speeding train passes only inches from the homes of this residential neighborhood.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hanois-train-street,"Around 3 p.m. and 7 p.m every day, a train hurtles through a series of narrow streets in Hanoi’s bustling, maze-like Old Quarter. Drying clothes are carried inside, children ushered indoors, and bikes pulled to the side of the road just before the train speeds past, with a couple feet of clearance at most on each side. In some places the train is mere inches from the buildings. The street’s residents press tight to the walls or duck into nearby doorways with a startling nonchalance and go right back to walking across or sitting on the tracks as soon as the train has passed. The railroad tracks take up nearly the entirety of the “train street,” as it’s been dubbed by the increasing trickle of tourists that come to glimpse the startling sight. The train passes the narrow road early in the route that connects Vietnam’s capital to Ho Chi Minh city in the south.  The train street is located between Le Duan and Kham Tien street in Hanoi's Old Quarter. The exact lane the train passes along is called Ngo 224 Le Duan."
114,Am Phu Cave,"Da Nang, Vietnam",This Vietnamese hell cave lets visitors take a walk through a devilish underworld full of demons.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/am-phu-cave,"In the Marble Mountains of Vietnam there is a huge cave known as Am Phu, and deep inside is a re-creation of a Buddhist hell where sinners confess crimes, suffer punishments, and hope to reach heaven’s light. At the city limits of Da Nang sits a cluster of five outcroppings known as the Marble Mountains. Sculptors once mined their white marble to make Buddhist statues, and while they are still crafted and sold in the surrounding villages, the marble is now imported from China. Each mountain is named for a different element, with the largest and most famous, Thuy Son (the Water Mountain), housing the notorious Am Phu cave. Discovered in the 19th century, King Minh Mang named the cave Am Phu (Vietnamese for “hell”) to signify a yin-yang dualism: while the mountain’s topside is considered heaven, visitors first pass through subterranean caverns representing hell. Opened to tourists in 2006, the natural rock formations, stalactites, and pitch-dark tunnels are enhanced with frightening figures and altars created by local artists. It is not unlike walking through a haunted house, with surprises lurking around every corner. Visitors cross a bridge symbolizing the passage from Earthly existence into the afterlife, begining with a hellish realm of man-hungry crocodiles, violent demons, and fanged devils bathed in sinister red light, where hands reach up from the waters below and river monsters threaten to gnash their souls to bits. Once inside the depths of Am Phu, fragrant incense overwhelms the air. At a temple shrine visitors can confess their sins and repent before a marble scale weighs their good and bad deeds. These visions of punishment haunt visitors until, finally, a steep stone staircase ascends to a sunlit opening. The climb is no easy path to enlightenment. Infrequent railings, helpful but scary handhold rings embedded in the marble, and the very steep twisting stairs reward one with a grand balcony view and a high sense of accomplishment. But note, it’s a dead end from which you must descend the same, now scarier, route. Climbing the stairs to salvation isn’t supposed to be easy, but this is where heaven begins—next door, on top of Thuy Son there are more caves, as well as divine shrines and pagodas. There are also reminders of the Vietnam War, including a chamber once used as a Viet Cong field hospital, and a plaque commemorating a Women’s Artillery battalion that was based nearby and destroyed 19 U.S. aircraft. Along with the heavenly shrines and carvings, the yin and yang of war and peace.  Take Le Van Hien south and turn left onto Huyen Tran Cong Chua. (Note, Thuy Son is the only Marble Mountain officially open to the public, and not to be confused with Tho Son, the earth mountain)"

Opened on March 29, 2013, the bridge commemorates the 38th anniversary of the taking of the port city of Da Nang by the North Vietnamese near the end of the Vietnam War. The metallic dragon was modeled on one from the Ly Dynasty and is illuminated with 2,500 LED lights. Watching it shoot fire might seem a bit terrifying for the six lanes of traffic that drive beneath the mythical giant, but it can also playfully spray water from its mouth."
116,Suoi Tien Cultural Theme Park,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Have fun at the world's first Buddhist waterslide park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/suoi-tien-cultural-theme-park,"Suoi Tien Cultural Theme Park is a Vietnamese water-filled fantasy land, located rather unromantically next to a rubbish dump 15 kilometres South of Ho Chi Minh City. Suoi Tien, or “the fairy stream,” is the world’s first water park devoted to Buddhism, specifically the Southeast Asian animistic form of Buddhism. The animism works well for the theme park; instead of Mickey and Daffy, Suoi Tien has chosen the Dragon, Unicorn, Tortoise, and Phoenix as its sacred animals, used thematically throughout the massive water park. Furthermore, workers in golden monkey outfits roam the park taking pictures with visitors and causing “mischief.” The park focuses on Vietnamese history, folklore, and of course on the Buddha himself. Among the parks many features are an oversized golden dragon whose mouth contains a neon haloed shrine to Buddha, avenues lined with pillars in the shape of giant elephant tusks, a swimming pool surrounded by a massive concrete facade of dragons and a giant rotating frog sculpture at the entrance. Particularly delightful are the twelve story face’s of the Buddhist sages - with water slides emerging from their beards. Children might enjoy a dog or turtle shaped boat ride around the island pavilions. But, beware the cutely-named Palace of Unicorns which contains a surprisingly gory house of horrors within. Perhaps the strangest and most unnerving feature of the enormous park is the crocodile kingdom. A pond with over 1,500 live crocodiles, visitors are invited to feed them with raw meat attached to fishing poles. The whole thing is quite impressive and constructed on a huge scale. Although, the lax safety controls -acres of wet, slippery concrete, low hanging stalactites in the cavern water slides, and the bay of crocodiles- remind you that you are not in Disneyland anymore.  A 20 minute taxi ride from downtown Saigon, although at some point it will be accessible from its own subway station. Times are 7:30 a.m.-5 p.m. (every day)"

Hương Thủy, Vietnam",An extravagant monument to an extravagantly unpopular Emperor.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tomb-of-nguyen-emperor-khai-dinh-tx-h-ng-th-y-vietnam,"Following in the footsteps of most of his Nguyen predecessors, Emperor Khai Dinh planned ahead of time for his final resting place. When he kicked the bucket in 1925, Khai Dinh was laid to rest in his lavish tomb, complete with a golden effigy of himself in the inner chamber. What sets Khai Dinh’s tomb apart from the others around Hue is its architectural fusion of Chinese, Vietnamese, and European Gothic elements. There are fierce dragons guarding the steps, stone elephants and warriors outside, and finally, massive wrought iron gates at the entrance. The inside of the tomb has some of the Emperor’s personal effects and gifts, as well as incredibly intricate patterns of ceramic and glass decorating the walls. The exterior iron and stone are juxtaposed by a truly magnificent interior reflective of a prodigious Emperor. Ironically, the tomb is less a monument to the Emperor himself but more a monument to his excessive wealth and disconnect from the ordinary man. Khai Dinh was reputed to be a pawn of the colonial French – so much so, he was mocked as a salaried employee of the French government – and he taxed his people heavily to finance the building of the elaborate edifice."
118,100 Roofs Cafe,"Dalat, Vietnam",This Vietnamese bar doubles as a multistory labyrinth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/100-roofs-cafe,"For those who like a shot alongside their fantastical, creepy-fairy-tale architecture, there’s no better destination than Đà Lạt’s 100 Roofs Cafe. Tucked along a side road, the building is surprisingly inconspicuous from outside. Inside, a multistory labyrinth a-mazes visitors with stairways to nowhere, underwater arthropods, and—for those who manage to make it to the top—breathtaking views of the city. Don’t let the “cafe” in the name fool you: 100 Roofs is a bar, and while it does serve coffee, most patrons come in search of stronger stuff. Visitors have to buy at least a drink in lieu of a cover fee—a decent deal to experience an epic maze—but considering the dim lighting and uneven surfaces, it may be wise to know your limits. In the midst of the maze, dead ends abound, sculpted women twist out of the walls, and tunnels appear seemingly out of nowhere. Once you emerge on the open roof, a tiered garden continues upward, ending in a sweeping view of Đà Lạt and, if you’re lucky, the night sky. Perhaps this is why locals call the building Đường Lên Trăng, or “the Way to the Moon.” Đà Lạt, the capital of Vietnam’s Lâm Đồng Province, is a small city that’s packed with architectural wonders. Besides the Way to the Moon, the city is also home to the “Crazy House,” a guesthouse whose toadstool twists and timber-like facade were the passion project of expressionist Vietnamese architect Đặng Việt Nga. Perhaps this concentration of architectural oddities explains the 100 Roofs Cafe’s magical vibe: Guests have compared the building to Hogwarts or hobbit homes in the Shire. If you pay the cafe a visit, enjoy sipping a drink while wandering through the labyrinth—just watch your footing lest you trip on an intoxicated Bilbo Baggins.  The bar is just 330 feet (100 meters) from the main market, but can be a bit tricky to find in its narrow-alleyed neighborhood.

Rice farmers working in the red river delta conceived this unusual art form over 1,000 years ago, likely when farmers adapted conventional puppetry onto water after a large flood. Although water puppetry is now performed across Vietnam and even tours the world, the most revered performance house is Thang Long Municipal theatre, located in the heart of Hanoi. At performances here, puppeteers stand waist deep in the water behind a screen, and operate the puppets on large rods to give the impression that the figures are moving across the water. Performances involve between 7 and 11 puppeteers who usually train for at least three years. In the past, skills were passed from father to son, as villagers feared that daughters would pass on the secrets of water puppetry when marrying outside of the village. The performances are accompanied by traditional Vietnamese folk music played on drums, cymbals, wooden bells, horns, bamboo flutes, and a single stringed guitar. The music is an integral part of the show, with the instrumentalists often shouting words of encouragement to the puppets.   The shows draw from both human and animal puppets to depict traditional Vietnamese folk tales and legends, such as the Legend of the Restored Sword of King Le (the story of Hoan Kiem Lake and the giant tortoise), a boy riding a buffalo whilst playing a flute, and fire breathing dragons dancing on the water, complete with fireworks. If used on a daily basis, the average lifespan of a water puppet is four months, meaning that some villages in Northern Vietnam are able to maintain their income and livelihoods on manufacturing water puppets.  Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre is right by Hoan Kiem Lake in the centre of Hanoi, and is near some of the most popular tourist attraction. The theatre is a 10 minute taxi ride from Hanoi's main station or a 25 minute walk. Between October and April, the Water Puppet Theatre can be very busy, so it is advisable to book in advance. There is an extra charge if you wish to bring a camera to the performance. Be wary of sitting in the front row - you may get wet!"
120,Dong Van Karst Plateau,"Đồng Văn, Vietnam",This striking landscape in northern Vietnam contains both geological and archaeological wonders.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dong-van-karst-plateau,"Located over 1,000 meters above sea level, Dong Van Karst Plateau consists of narrow valleys alternating with rocky mountain ranges in the north of Vietnam. Over 80 percent of the surface is covered with limestone, including a high concentration of rocky peaks sitting over 2,000 meters above sea level. The rock of Dong Van is believed to contain fossils from 400 million to 600 million years ago. This geological anomaly—recognized by UNESCO in October 2010 as one of just 77 geological parks in the world—spreads over the districts of Meo Vac, Dong Van, Yen Minh and Quan Ba, encompassing a total area of 2,300 square kilometers. At the center of the plateau is Dong Van Town, located 150 kilometers from the center of Ha Giang Province. The plateau is not only a fascinating landscape but also an extraordinary piece of history. Archeologists have carried out excavations in the Quan Ba and Yen Minh districts on Dong Van Plateau and discovered many stone tools from the Son Vi Civilization, dating back 10,000 to 30,000 years. This is important evidence that prehistoric men resided on the rock plateau. Excavations in Can Ty Commune, Quan Ba District have found nearly 200 farming tools of prehistoric men. From Noi Bai International Airport, head onto National Road No.2 to the north for 320 kilometers to arrive at the very peaceful Ha Giang Town by the Mien River. To get the karst plateau:
From Ha Giang City, visitors travel on National Highway 4C for 43km to Quan Ba. Continuing on this highway through Can Ty Pass, pine forests, steep drops, deep ravines, and razor sharp turns, visitors will reach to Dong Van karst plateau."
121,Anthony Bourdain and Barack Obama's Dinner Table,"Hanoi, Vietnam",The spot where the two men ate together now stands enclosed in glass.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/anthony-bourdain-and-barack-obama-dinner-table,"In May 2016, the Vietnamese noodle store Bún Chả Hương Liên went from relative obscurity to being on television screens all over the world, after two of the world’s most famous men chose it as their dinner spot in Hanoi. Anthony Bourdain and President Barack Obama came for the slippery noodles or fragrant pork patties—but the world tuned in not for the food, but to see these two icons sit on blue plastic stools drinking chilled bottles of local beer. At the time of the meal, Bourdain was filming the CNN series Parts Unknown. A year earlier, he told the network, the White House had reached out to try to arrange a meal between the president and himself: something fun and unexpected. This relative hole-in-the-wall, where the total cost of the meal came in at under $10, fit the bill. (Bourdain picked up the check.) Footage from the series shows the men laughing and chatting over their noodles like two old friends. “Is it appropriate to chuck one of these whole suckers in your mouth?” the president asks, gesturing at a patty with his chopsticks. “Well, slurping is totally acceptable in this part of the world,” Bourdain replies, with a laugh. They received no directive from the White House about which topics were and were not up for discussion, Bourdain later told the network. “We spoke like two dads, and Southeast Asian enthusiasts, and had a good time.” Today, the restaurant continues to thrive. It looks much as it did when Bourdain and Obama sat down to eat there, but there are a few key changes. Guests hoping to relive the experience can now order a “Combo Obama” from the menu: bun cha, a seafood spring roll, and a bottle of Hanoi beer for a total of 105,000 VND, or about $4.50. But what they can’t do is sit down at that same table, in those same blue plastic stools. The restaurant’s encased the entire set-up in glass for posterity. (From time to time, they also pop a decorative plant on top.) The metal-topped table’s still set, as if waiting for the return of its diners, ready with plates, bowls, chopsticks, and beers. When Bourdain died in June 2018, Obama tweeted a photo of the two men drinking their beers in that restaurant, with the caption: “This is how I’ll remember Tony. He taught us about food — but more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown. We’ll miss him.”"
122,Cafe Pho Co,"Hanoi, Vietnam","Walk through a clothing store, across a courtyard, and up several flights of stairs for delicious coffee with a side of beautiful views.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cafe-pho-co,"Cafe Pho Co, a coffee shop in Hanoi, takes the concept of hole-in-the-wall to a whole other level. Several levels up, in fact. To reach it, you must first walk through a clothing store, down a narrow hallway, then across a courtyard filled with birdcages, plants, and the occasional roaming chicken. Then, you’ll start ascending the stairs, up through what seems to be a home, past a family shrine and a portly ginger cat, and finally to the roof. You could sit on the floor below the roof, but then you wouldn’t get the same delightful views of the city, including the green expanse of Hoan Kiem Lake. Slide into one of the patio chairs and sip on cà phê trứng, also known as Vietnamese egg coffee, a popular style that adds a whisked egg and usually a heaping helping of sugar or condensed milk to Robusta coffee for a decadent, foamy effect. Chocolate fans should try the cacao trứng, which adds hot cocoa to the mix for rich, mocha flavors. If it’s hot out, the cafe serves iced versions of most of its brews, as well. You’ll place your order at one of the lower floors. While the service is known for being a little slow, that’s all the more reason to sit back and enjoy the view at this little space tucked away above all the bustle of the city below."
123,Da Lat Crazy House,"Dalat, Vietnam",A Surreal flight of architectural fancy in Vietnam's Central Highlands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/da-lat-crazy-house,"This bizarre guesthouse is one of the landmarks of the city of Da Lat, a mountain resort popular with local honeymooners. In the Crazy House, Antoni Gaudi meets Alice in Wonderland in a fantastic folly of twisting, tree-trunk-like concrete and artificial caverns, winding flights of stairs and irregular windows, stalactites and stalagmites, flowering purple vines, and an over-sized sculpture of a giraffe. The interiors are no less intriguing. In one room, guests are watched over by the glowing red eyes of a kangaroo. Other rooms feature elaborate local tribal decorations, or carved birds looming over beds tucked snugly into cave-like nooks. The whole complex was a labor of love for avant-garde architect Hang Nga, who lives on site and sometimes chats with guests. She is an interesting person to talk to; besides designing buildings like this and her other Da Lat landmark (“The House of One Thousand Roofs,” now demolished), she is daughter of a former Vietnamese vice president. Sightseers are welcome to tour the building during the day for a small fee or to book a room and stay the night. Bring warm clothes: the Da Lat Crazy House is at a high altitude, and all that concrete gets mighty chilly after sunset.  A 10 minute taxi ride from the center of town. Important that you watch your step and keep an eye on any children with you. There are several stair cases and rooms which have less than adequate safety railings. In many places you are facing a 50+ foot drop."
124,Cu Chi Tunnels,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",A nightmare for the claustrophobic lies hidden in Southeast Asia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cu-chi-tunnels,"The suburban Cu Chi district of Ho Chi Minh City sits atop an enormous network of tunnels. For thousands of Viet Cong soldiers, this sprawling network of cramped passageways was an entire world unto itself, complete with living quarters, communications centers and hospitals. Though the tunnels became famous in the Vietnam War, parts of the network were first constructed in the 1940s by peasants fighting French occupation forces. By the mid-1960s, the tunnel system had grown to over 75 miles in length. Viet Cong soldiers living in the tunnels would spend most of their day digging new passageways, only daring to venture out at night for supplies and to perform guerilla raids. Defensive measures built into the network included explosive booby traps and stake pits, making the work of American soldiers attempting to infiltrate the tunnels incredibly dangerous. Beyond the intentional deterrents, the tunnels were also hot, damp and infested with a variety of snakes and insects; reports suggest that as many as half of all Viet Cong soldiers were infected with malaria at any given time. American bombing raids succeeded in destroying sections of the tunnel network near the end of the war, but much of the system remains intact. It has since become a tourist attraction, where visitors can attempt to crawl through a short passage - or, if necessary, a section that has been widened for the convenience of westerners."
125,Po Shanu Cham Towers,"Phan Thiet, Vietnam",These crumbling towers are some of the last remnants of a centuries-old Vietnamese culture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/po-shanu-cham-towers,"While there are little remnants of the once flourishing Cham empire that once created intricate stone structures across Vietnam, the crumbling Po Shanu Cham Towers are a telling reminder of a once successful civilization and what can be lost if we don’t preserve their legacy. While there are other sites featuring the remnants of Cham architecture the remaining towers in Phan Thiết are some of the more representative examples of the lost culture’s architecture. Echoing the spires and details on such sites as Angkor Wat, the Po Shanu Cham towers look like the ruins of an otherworldly culture. Unfortunately, it is easy to tell that even with the remaining structures, the site must have been a great deal more impressive, and likely featured a number of other buildings that were lost to time. Now the Po Shanu Cham towers consist of just two pointed towers, and third building that adjoins the more decorative constructions. Little is known about the exact history of the towers, and unfortunately they have fallen into a bit of disrepair thanks to neglect and unfortunately destructive restoration efforts. Nonetheless these ancient intricate stone spires will hopefully survive long enough to be preserved for later generations to see the works of the Cham for themselves."
126,Kingdom of Redonda,Antigua and Barbuda,A hotly contested micro-nation off the coast of Montserrat.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kingdom-of-redonda,"It would be ideal to have hard evidence about the history of Redonda. But unfortunately, reality and legend have blurred over the last 150 years, and now the world is left to deal with an island micro-nation, playing host to conflicting claims to a throne that may or may not be legitimate. According to his progeny, the Kingdom of Redonda was founded by Matthew Dowdy Shiell and was done so in a legal manner. In 1865, Shiell, who had noticed a seemingly unclaimed and unpopulated island in the Caribbean near Montserrat, put forth a petition to Queen Victoria to become king of the Island. The Queen consented, and a line of kings was created. Shiell’s son, a science fiction writer, took his kingship and ran with it, spreading the word about Redonda in pamphlets that many took as complete fiction. Shiell’s son may have done irreparable damage to the legitimacy of the island by simply being involved, but nonetheless, Redonda’s notoriety spread. When Shiell’s son died, he left the island and title of king to a man named John Gawsworth, who changed the history of the island forever. Often penniless, Gawsworth was known to sell the title of king multiple times. While this did well to fatten his pocketbook, Gawsworth also appointed multiple monarchs, settting up for huge Redonda drama in the 20th century. In 2007, the last man to claim the title of King of Redonda renounced his claim to the BBC. However, Redonda was not yet out of the news. Later in 2007, a pub in England claimed to be an embassy of Redonda to gain diplomatic immunity from a smoking ban. The last sources on the conflict state that the pub’s owner was in fact given knighthood by the latest king of Redonda."
127,VC Bird Monument,"St John's, Antigua and Barbuda",An imposing statue of the first prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda stands in the middle of a traffic intersection.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vc-bird-monument,"Vere Cornwall Bird, the first prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, was born in St John’s in 1910. He became prime minister in 1981 and held that position until 1994. During that time, Bird took the twin-island nation from a British colony to an independent nation. Bird is seen by many as the father of the nation, and homages to him can be found all over the island of Antigua (the international airport for example was renamed in his honor).  However, none are as bright or have such a prominent placement as the VC Bird Monument. This brightly colored bust of VC Bird occupies a prime position in downtown St John’s next to the public market. The monument, designed and sculpted by the Cuban artist, Andres Gonzalez, was installed in 2002, just three years after Bird’s death. The statue stands 10 meters (33 feet) tall, and depicts a besuited middle-aged Bird (who himself was 2.1 meters or seven feet tall) with his hand on his chest. Next to him is a black pineapple, a type of fruit that is said to be a delicacy and unique to the island. Getting a close up of the monument is a challenge: its situated in a small triangular at the intersection of two busy roads. Sadly the plaza is closed to the public, but it is possible to get a good look through the railings."
