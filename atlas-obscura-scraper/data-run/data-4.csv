0,Seven Coloured Earths,"Chamarel, Mauritius",This small group of sand dunes manages to pack in a strange rainbow of colors.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/seven-coloured-earths,"Known as Terres des Sept Couleurs in French, the Seven Colored Earths in Mauritius is a rare geological oddity that proves brown is far from the only color of dirt. Surrounded by forest and spreading out in seven distinct colors (red, brown, violet, green, blue, purple, and yellow), these psychedelic dunes were formed thanks to a rare confluence of volcanic activity which brought a number of different elements together, each with their own distinct hue. The rolling bands of color are caused by a strange phenomenon in which the different sand particles seem to miraculously settle together, creating patches of red iron or blue aluminum. Another odd feature of the dunes is that they do not seem to erode, despite Mauritius’ heavy and frequent rains. The natural beauty of the site has attracted a healthy tourist trade and a wooden fence was erected to protect the sands, but nothing can protect visitors’ eyes from the striking colors on display."
1,Le Pouce (The Thumb),"Moka, Mauritius",The “Thumb” of Mauritius provides a 360 degree view of the entire country.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/le-pouce-the-thumb,"From the top of Le Pouce one can see almost the entire circumference of Mauritius. The hike up takes barely an hour and a half, beginning in a field of sugarcane and ending atop a grassy summit just big enough for a picnic blanket. The peak, which resembles a thumb (hence its name) is part of the Moka Range and is 812 meters in elevation. Standing at the top and looking out over Port Louis, the country’s capital, one can spy the famous Champs de Mars Racecourse and vessels going in and out of the harbor. Spin 360 degrees and Snake Island and Flat Island will float into view a little ways to the north, then Pieter Both will emerge to the east (a peak which looks like a little cloaked head, named after a Dutchman), then more mountains wrapping around the south, and endless ocean all around. A volcanic eruption millions of years ago left behind the island’s jagged assortment of peaks. Charles Darwin also once stood atop the Thumb—the scientist-explorer made his own visit here in 1836. Path signage hasn’t improved much since then, but it would be very difficult to get lost. There’s also a trail that continues from the town of Moka along the edge of the thumb and ends up on the outskirts of Port Louis, if one is seeking out some dim sum or Burger King. Located 1,200 miles off the southeastern coast of Africa, Mauritius is a mere 30 miles long and 29 miles wide; you can drive anywhere within about a half-hour. The island is named after a Dutchman, the people all speak French and a French Creole, and the school and government systems are British. Mauritius calls itself both a “paradise island” and “rainbow nation”; it is home to people of Asian, European, and African decent, the majority of its population being Indo-Mauritians. The country became independent from Britain in 1968."
2,The Last Bois Dentelle Trees,Mauritius,"Only two of these trees remain in the natural world, found high in the cloud forest of a Mauritius island.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-last-bois-dentelle-trees-mauritius,"With the scientific name Elaeocarpus bojeri, this beautiful flowering tree is known for its sprays of long, white, bell-shaped flowers. It is from the delicate patterns of the flowers that the tree gets its common name: bois dentelle or “Lace Wood.” The bois dentelle trees are found in very few places, one of which is located high in the cloud forest of the island of Mauritius, on a hill called the Piton Grand Bassin. For man years, that was the only place they were found, because only two of them were known to remain in nature. The tree has come so close to extinction, not because it is commercially viable, but because it isn’t. Its environment is being overrun by more commercially attractive alien species such as Guava and a small evergreen shrub Litsea monopetala. The last two of these trees would also have disappeared forever, taking with them the secrets locked in their genetics, if it hadn’t been for intervention. Since the Ministry of Agriculture and the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation stepped in they have been able to save the two remaining trees, and successfully made two offspring in a tree nursery from the seeds of these trees. In December 2018, it was reported the forestry department found a few more natural-growing trees in the mountains in the north. Despite these promising updates, the tree remains critically endangered, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature."
3,Champ de Mars,"Port Louis, Mauritius","Dating back to 1812, this is the oldest racecourse in the Southern Hemisphere.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/champ-de-mars-racecourse,"Founded in 1812, the Champ de Mars Racecourse is the oldest racecourse in the Southern Hemisphere and the second-oldest in the world. Located in Mauritius’ capital of Port Louis, the track held its first races in June 1812, the same year that British forces took over the island from the French. When the country finally declared its independence 156 years later, it was right here at the racecourse. The Champs de Mars Racecourse was created under the auspices of the Mauritius Turf Club, founded by Britain’s Colonel Draper. Before 1810, the area was a military training ground for French troops. The course has a circumference of 1,298 meters (4,258 feet), and viewers can spectate from stadium seating as well as private lodges. Inside the course, you’ll find a statue of King Edward VII by sculptor Prosper d’Épinay as well as an obelisk known as the Malartic Tomb, which pays tribute to a French governor. Today, the races meet a high international standard, and racing is one of the country’s most popular sports. Mauritius’ big horse races include the Duchess of York Cup, Barbé Cup, Maiden Cup, and the Duke of York Cup. The horses and jockeys come mostly from South Africa and Australia, and the racing season extends from April to November, with races held on weekends. The manager and owner are known to be very friendly and welcoming to visitors, and might just show you around if you run into them. You can stroll up to Champ de Mars from the harbor, nestled in a valley surrounded by the country’s jagged volcanic mountains, all while enjoying the soft Indian Ocean breeze. Afterward, you can head back downtown, past the mosques and Chinatown, the British statues and French-language schools, for any of the country’s many cuisines."
4,Slave Route Monument,"Le Morne, Mauritius","This monument sits at the foot of a mountain where, according to legend, enslaved people jumped to their deaths.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/le-morne-slave-route-monument,"The massive cliff at Le Morne Brabant mountain on the island of Mauritius is shrouded in dark tales. Mauritius was once a part of the complex and far-reaching international slave trade, and people say that hundreds of slaves threw themselves off the cliff rather than face the horrors of dehumanization. There’s another, even darker tale: Some say that after the British passed the Slavery Abolition Act in 1834, a group of soldiers and police went to the Le Morne area to let runaway slaves know that they were finally free. But the slaves, seeing the authorities approaching, feared that they were being recaptured and returned to their masters, and climbed to the top of the mountain summit and threw themselves off committing suicide by landing in the ocean. The Slave Route Monument is located at the foot of Le Morne mountain, in clear view of the caves in the cliff faces where it is rumored that runaway slaves were apparently known to hide, and the sheer drop from the mountain into what’s since been called the “Valley of Bones.” If you’re aware of the legends behind your surroundings, even a short visit to the monument will be a moving and thought-provoking one. (It should be noted that there is yet to be any archaeological evidence of the tragedy like bones found on the beach.) Across from one of the country’s pristine public beaches, the site is in a quiet garden enclosure at the foot of Le Morne mountain. You will find a central sculpture surrounded by various other sculptures and engravings, meant to symbolize the different origin and destination countries of the slaves brought into or sent from Mauritius, which include Mozambique, Madagascar, India, China, Malaysia, Haïti, Réunion island, France and Senegal.. In 2009, Mauritius established the Slave Route Monument as a symbol to recognize and commemorate the impact and influence of slavery and the slave trade on Mauritian history. It was part of a larger UNESCO effort officially launched in Benin in 1994 known as the Slave Route Project, looking to have such monuments erected in countries affected by the slave trade. The project was formally launched in Mauritius in 2005 with the establishment of a Slave Route National Committee under the Ministry of Arts and Culture. In the century between the 1720s and 1820s, over 200,000 slaves—many of whom were illegally introduced after the British outlawed the slave trade in 1807—arrived in Mauritius and Reunion Island from East African and Malagasy ports, according to American slave historian Pier Larson. Many died aboard slave ships en route to their destinations, and ultimately, the slave trade in Mauritius is inextricably linked with the deaths of hundreds of thousands of slaves. The history of the slave in Mauritius is commemorated annually on August 23rd, UNESCO’s International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade, in the hopes of generating greater awareness of this part of the country’s past. It is rather pertinent to highlight that this factual truth (related to slavery on the island) pertains generally to the greater island region of Mauritius and not necessarily to the concentrated focus that the myth and legend places on the mountain of Le Morne Brabant itself given the lack of circumstantial evidence.  The Slave Route Monument is located at the foot of Le Morne mountain. It is opposite a public beach near the Hotel Dinarobin. It is free, though not open at all hours. It is best to check with local sources before going."
5,The Tree Goats of Morocco,"Tamri, Morocco",Morocco's Argania trees are infested with nut-hungry goats.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tree-goats-of-morocco-tamri-morocco,"The Argania tree is not the most aesthetically pleasing plant in the world with a rough, thorny bark and gangly, crooked branches. But these Moroccan trees still tend to attract admirers, thanks in large part to the hordes of goats. The animals stand on the impossibly precarious branches and get down to their seasonal feast. Far from just a single ambitious goat climbing a single tree, the animals tend to swarm into the branches in number. Local farmers condone and even cultivate this bizarre feeding practice, keeping the goats away from the trees while the fruit matures and releasing them at the right time. There is also a secondary benefit to the goats’ habits which is found in their poop. After the goats finish eating the fruit and nuts off the tree, they pass valuable clumps of seeds which are then pressed to create the sought-after Argan oil. Unfortunately, since the tree goats can be quite profitable for their owners, more and more of them have been brought into the area, causing a general decline in the health of the remaining Argania trees. Hopefully, the delightful tree goats won’t eat themselves out of a tree to perch in.  Although it is illegal, scammers will tie goats all day to the trees in the hot sun hoping to elicit money from you when you stop for pictures. If this happens, leave immediately. It's the only way to send the message that animal cruelty doesn't pay."
6,Jardin Majorelle,"Marrakesh, Morocco","It took 40 years to build this Eden-like garden in Marrakech, later restored by Yves Saint-Laurent.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jardin-majorelle,"The Jardin Majorelle, or Majorelle Garden, is a botanical and artist’s landscape garden in Marrakech. Originally created by the French artist Jacques Majorelle over a period of 40 years, and later restored by Yves Saint-Laurent, it is one of the most beautiful gardens in Morocco. Jacques Majorelle (1886-1962) was the son of the renowned Art Nouveau furniture designer Louis Majorelle. The Frenchman was a man of many talents and interests, but was best known as an Orientalist painter. Until, that is, he built the Jardin Majorelle, a labor of love 40 years in the making, and for which he is most widely recognized today. Majorelle arrived in Morocco in 1917, first to Casablanca and then to Marrakech. He fell in love with the colorful city, and in 1923 purchased a plot of land near a palm grove. As he became more established, he slowly began to develop and expand his property. He built himself a house in the Moorish style, and a Berber-style building with a tall adobe tower, which he called the Borj. In 1931, Majorelle commissioned the architect Paul Sinoir to design and build a Cubist villa near his first house. He used the ground floor as his workshop, and the second floor as his studio and while he continued to paint, Majorelle also dove headlong into one of his other passions, that of an amateur botanist. For almost 40 years, he carefully cultivated 135 plant species from five continents, turning his property into an enchanting landscape garden of cactus, yucca, jasmine, bougainvillea, palms, coconut trees, banana trees, white water lilies, bamboo and more. He also used his own color to paint the buildings dotted around the property, a clear and intense blue that he trademarked as bleu Majorelle, or Majorelle Blue. The garden became an expensive passion for Majorelle, a fact he didn’t hide: “This garden is a momentous task, to which I give myself entirely. It will take my last years from me and I will fall, exhausted, under its branches, after having given it all my love.” In 1947, he decided to open it to the public to help with the maintenance costs. Not long after, things started to go wrong for Jacques Majorelle. He divorced from his wife, Andrée Longueville, in 1956, which forced him to split up the property. He then suffered a serious car accident, eventually leading to the amputation of his left leg. The operations drained his finances and he was forced to sell off his share of the villa and gardens. He was sent to Paris for treatment, where he died of complications from his injuries on October 14, 1962. The Jardin Majorelle fell into disrepair during this period. But four years after the death of Jacques Majorelle, hope arrived in the shape of French fashion designer Yves Saint-Laurent and his lifelong business partner (and, at the time, lover) Pierre Bergé. They discovered the Jardin Majorelle in 1966 and immediately fell in love with it. In 1980, when they heard the property was likely to be bulldozed and turned into a hotel complex, they promptly purchased the Jardin Majorelle and set about restoring it. Careful to maintain the original vision of Jacques Majorelle, Saint-Laurent and Bergé oversaw a restoration project that not only revived the garden but expanded upon it. Automatic irrigation systems were installed; a team of 20 gardeners was put in place, and the number of plant species was increased from 135 to 300. Yves Saint-Laurent died in 2008, and his ashes were scattered in the rose garden at Jardin Majorelle. Two years later, the street in front of the Jardin Majorelle was renamed the Rue Yves Saint Laurent in his honor. In 2010, ownership of the property passed to the Foundation Pierre Bergé – Yves Saint Laurent, a French not-for-profit organization. In 2011, the Berber Museum was inaugurated on the garden grounds, offering a rich insight into the creativity of the Berber people, the most ancient of North Africa.  Jardin Majorelle is located at Rue Yves Saint Laurent in Marrakech, close to Avenue Yacoub el-Mansour in the northeast of Bab Doukkala. You can take the bus to the Boukar Majorelle stop and walk the short distance to the gardens. Jardin Majorelle is open every day of the year, from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. from October 1 to April 30, and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. from May 1 to September 30. Entrance to the gardens is 70 Dhs (about $7.50 US) and an additional 30 Dhs ($3) for the museum. Try to arrive early to avoid the crowds. Alternatively, try to be there about one hour before the closing time, as there are fewer people."
7,Chefchaouen,"Chefchaouen, Morocco","Founded as a refugee camp, now a popular tourist spot.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chefchaouen,"In Chefchaouen, calls to prayers ring out while hashish smoke lazily climbs toward the skyline. The city is punctuated strongly by the contrast between Moroccan tourist hedonism and pious Islamic practices. However, a lesser-known influence lies beneath the surface yet still in plain sight of all who visit. Aside from peddlers hawking marijuana from the surrounding region, the most noticeable characteristic of this mountainous town is the facades of buildings, painted in varying shades of blue. Powder blue doors leap out against whitewashed walls and entire alleyways emulate the cloudless sky above. Although there is little indication of the origins of the beautiful color of the city, it is actually a medieval remnant of a population long lost in the area. During the late 15th century, the Spanish Inquisition forced Muslims and Jews out of Europe. Beginning in 1471, Chefchaouen was founded essentially as a refugee camp with a prominent Jewish influence. Following in Jewish traditions, the refugees painted their buildings blue as a reminder of the God’s power above. Even as the Jewish population faded in the area and gave way to a stronger Muslim presence, the tradition of blue buildings continued. Today, residents of Chefchaouen still regularly paint their houses, keeping the blue city fresh and the lost tradition alive. Buses are available from Fez, Tangier, Tetouan, and Casablanca. Only the medina, the old section of the city, is painted blue, so ensure your accommodations are in the medina. The modern part of the city is small and underwhelming. ""Riads"" tend to be the fancier guesthouses. The word ""riad"" comes from the Arabic word for ""garden."" They are typically larger and grander than other accommodations."
8,Tin Mal Mosque,"Al Haouz, Morocco",The remains of a magnificent medieval fortress that was the capital of a vast empire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tin-mal-mosque,"In a small village, deep in the High Atlas mountains, lie the remains of a medieval Almohad fortress that once was the capital of a vast empire stretching from Mali to Tunisia and Spain. The city of Tin Mal was established by Ibn Tumart, the founder and mahdi (spiritual leader) of the Almohads, around 1124, and was the cultural and religious center of the empire until the city’s destruction by the rival Merinid dynasty in the 1270s. All that was spared, apart from a few fragments of wall, was the monumental mosque constructed in 1156 in honor of Ibn Tumart, according to official Almohad doctrine. The mosque was abandoned for many years, but restored in the 1990s. It stands prominently on a hill overlooking the rural village that Tin Mal (also called Tinmel) has become today. Unlike most Almohad mosques, non-Muslims are allowed inside, although you may have to phone the guard to open the door. The interior is remarkably well-preserved, with an elaborate mihrab (the niche in the wall that faces Mecca, indicating the direction of prayer) and vaulted pillars. The mosque is unique in having its minaret above the mihrab rather than in a separate tower, giving it a castle-like appearance from the outside. To visit Tin Mal you will have to take one of the most breathtaking roads in Morocco, the Tizi n’Test in the High Atlas. Tin Mal is just about 100km from Marrakech, but it could not look more different. The Mosque is just after the sign for Tin Mal, and to enter it you will need to contact Youssef, the official guard. Brick and stone pillars rise to create beautiful arches, and the remaining stucco will give you a glimpse of how it must have looked in its times of glory. There is no fee to visit the Mosque, but donations are welcome. Although beautiful, the road through the High Atlas is tricky and a driver is recommended. The guardian's number is 0662725612 (it is also on the door of the Mosque), but keep in mind that you are in the middle of the mountains and connection is not always the best. In that case, asking a local should do the trick."
9,Kasbah du Toubkal,"Imlil, Morocco",A Moroccan getaway in the mountain range that plays the Himalayas' stunt double.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kasbah-du-toubkal,"A peaceful chunk of Berber culture restored, the Kasbah du Toubkal is located in the middle of the Atlas Mountain range. The original owner, a local chief, must have had good taste if the scenery of this site is any indication. The surrounding geography was spectacular enough to stand in for the Himalayas in Martin Scorsese’s film Kundun. The hotel itself is an attraction and you needn’t necessarily be a guest to visit the exotic spot. From a small village below, a path leads visitors to the spectacular setting. There, they can try some of the traditional foods or mint tea surrounded by traditional Berber style. There are also treks (which may include rides on muleback) to visit more of the mountains, the nearby village and Toubkal National Park, which surrounds the area. The hotel makes efforts to be sustainable and support the nearby community; five percent of profits go toward the local villages, helping to provide education to the local youth. Most of the employees are from the nearby area, and the rebuilding effort used traditional techniques, as electricity hadn’t arrived to the remote mountain area quite yet when the task was at hand.

10,Todra Gorge,"Province de Tinghir, Morocco",One of the most spectacular canyons in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/todra-gorge,"Situated on the east side of the High Atlas Mountains in Morocco, the Todra Gorge is one of the world’s most spectacular canyons. Here, both the Todra and Dades Rivers have carved out cliff-sided canyons on their final 25-mile stretch through the mountains, leaving behind this series of reliefs and etches in the rock. The Todra is the name of the last 600 meters (just under 2,000 feet) of the canyons. In places, this gorge measures just 33 feet across, but the cliffs are more than 500 feet tall on either side. The river has since dried up, leaving only the imagination to picture the powerful natural forces that once carved this region. The gorge, though in a remote area of Morocco, is a popular tourist destination and has been outfitted over the years with hiking paths and a well-maintained dirt road that visitors can walk along, though they must share it with mules and other pack animals. The town of Tinerhir has grown to accommodate tourists and locals passing through the area with their possessions on camelback. Tinerhir, which houses just 36,000 permanent residents, swells to nearly 90,000 residents in popular holidays months, according to the 2004 census. A region of Ouarzazate, the town is mostly populated by Amazighs, which is what many Berbers, the indigenous peoples of North Africa west of the Nile Valley, call themselves. It roughly translates to “free people” or “free and noble men.”"
11,Caves of Hercules,"Tangier, Morocco",Along the most northwestern point in Africa is an ancient cave surrounded by legends.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/caves-of-hercules,"Along the most northwestern tip of the African continent is an intriguing cave complex steeped in myths and legends. According to the lore, it was even visited by one of Roman mythology’s most famous heroes. According to the myth, Hercules (adapted from the Greek Heracles) slept here on his way to steal three golden apples from the Garden of the Hesperides. Stealing the apples, which were believed to confer immortality, was the 11th of the “12 Labors of Hercules.” According to the ancient writers, the garden was located in nearby Lixus (the current city of Larache at the Atlantic coast). Another story goes that the cave is the one end of a 15-mile-long (24 kilometers) tunnel between Morocco and Spain. A popular folktale is that the famous macaque monkeys at the rock of Gibraltar came from Africa this way. You won’t find Hercules or monkeys within the caves, but they’re worth exploring nonetheless. The complex has two openings. The one that faces the sea resembles the shape of Africa, and is said to have been created by the Phoenicians. The opening that faces land was created by the local Berbers, who cut their stones from the rock. The caves are close to the Cap Spartel lighthouse that was built between 1861 and 1864 by an international coalition (including the United States, France, Spain, and Morocco) and marks the entrance of the Strait of Gibraltar.  The Caves of Hercules are located at Cape Spartel, the most northwestern point of mainland Africa, just under nine miles (14 kilometers) west of Tangier. The cave is open to the public and be reached easily following national road S701."
12,Jemaa el-Fna Square,"Marrakesh, Morocco","Fortune tellers, snake charmers, poets, and storytellers all gather on this historic square in Morocco.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jemaa-elfna,"For a thousand years, Jemaa el-Fna has served as a gathering place and market at the heart of Marrakesh. Fortune tellers, snake charmers, poets, and storytellers come to entertain the crowds, helping to create an intoxicating atmosphere whose cultural importance inspired UNESCO to create its “Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.” Jemaa el-Fna dates back to the founding of Marrakesh by the Almoravids in 1062 and later grew in importance when the Almohads took the city in 1147, renovating the square and the city around it. For almost a thousand years, the square has functioned as a market and gathering place at the heart of the city, where fearsome rulers once held public decapitations to keep their subjects in line. Today, the square attracts the entire spectrum of life in Marrakesh: locals of varying social and ethnic backgrounds, and tourists from across the world. In the morning, stall owners set up their stands selling orange juice, spices, traditional medicines, mint leaves, and snails. The flutes of snake charmers drift across the square, monkey trainers entertain the crowd, and tooth-pullers ready their pliers to pluck out the aching teeth of passersby. Once the sun sets, Jemaa el-Fna really comes alive. Restaurants around the square start serving hungry customers as they stroll around the plaza. Berber musicians and Gnaoua dancers begin their nightly performances, acrobats and slapstick comedians start performing all across the square, and henna tattoo artists vie for customers as storytellers, and poets pass on the oral traditions of Morocco. Jemaa el-Fna’s position as an important place of cultural exchange and artistic heritage was the inspiration for UNESCO’s “Proclamation of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity” in 2001. When locals and other concerned parties began fighting to protect the traditions of the square in the face of growing economic development pressures, UNESCO got on board. Jemaa el-Fna became the first place to gain Masterpiece status, helping to promote and safeguard its traditions. During the opening meeting for the new UNESCO initiative, the Spanish poet and novelist Juan Goytisolo highlighted the qualities of the historic square: “The spectacle of Jemaa el Fna is repeated daily and each day it is different. Everything changes—voices, sounds, gestures, the public which sees, listens, smells, tastes, touches. The oral tradition is framed by one much vaster – that we can call intangible. The Square, as a physical space, shelters a rich oral and intangible tradition.”  Jemaa el-Fna is located in the medina quarter of Marrakesh. The square is open daily and things typically get going at around 8 a.m. and continue until at least midnight. Pickpockets are common, especially after dark. Also be prepared to see some questionable practices among the snake charmers and monkey trainers, who sometimes treat their animals in a less than ethical way. Be careful when takeing photos! Always aks if it's ok to avoid argueing with snake charmers, monkey trainers, singers.."
13,Volubilis Archaeological Site,"Meknes, Morocco","Mosaics, storks, and brothels—this ancient city has it all.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/volubilis-archaeological-site,"Built in and occupied since the third century BC, Volubilis had seen its share of residents—Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and Romans—before being taken back by the locals by 285. The city remained occupied by Latin Christians, then Muslims, then the Idrisid Dynasty, the founders of modern Morocco. In the 11th century, it was abandoned when the seat of power moved to Fez, and the city’s stones were looted for the building of Meknes after a powerful earthquake in the 18th century. Under French occupation, excavation identified the site officially as the Roman city of Volubilis. The excavations revealed glorious mosaic floors, temples, a basilica, aqueduct, baths, gates, and—as in every good old town—brothels. Besides the usual Berber men selling postcards and “authentic” Roman coins, the city is now occupied by a new kind of resident: storks. What better place for these large birds to build their bulky nests than atop a Roman column? The smooth sides protect them from any land animal and their size and paternal protectiveness protect them from above. Storks can be seen throughout Morocco, nesting atop monuments. In 1997, the city of Volubilis was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A quick pit stop there is usually part of a tour package, on the road from Meknes to Fes."
14,The Blue Gate of Fes,"Fez, Morocco",The other side is actually green.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-blue-gate-of-fes-fez-morocco,"If you’ve been to Fes, Morocco, you’ll immediately recognize the Grande Porte Bab Boujeloud, also known as “The Blue Gate of Fes.” If you exit through the Bab Boujloud, however, you’ll note that its other side is actually green. The towering entryway with its mosaic tiles is the most iconic portal to the old medina, Fes el-Bali, the world’s largest surviving medieval city and urban car-free zone. The blue on the side that greets new visitors represents the color of the city of Fes, which is famous for its pottery, painted with elegant cobalt blue designs. The reverse side, which faces the medina, is green—the color of Islam. Built in 1913, the bab (gate) is a doorway between two equally colorful and dynamic scenes, one that feels distinctly 21st century, and the other an intriguing mix of different eras. Once you pass through “The Blue Gate,” the thrum of traffic will quickly fade, replaced by the din of shopkeepers selling their wares and the muffled footsteps of thousands of animals and pedestrians making their way through the winding alleyways. From the Bab Boujeloud entrance, you’ll come upon the two main alleyways into the medina, the Tala’a Kbira and Tala’a Sghira—though whichever you take, you’ll probably get lost. There are several eateries just inside the gate, and if you find a table on an upper perch, you can watch the mesmerizing and never-ending movement of people and wares from above, passing to and fro."
15,'The Hills Have Eyes' Gas Station,"Province de Ouarzazate, Morocco","An abandoned horror film set sits eerily along a highway through Hollywood's ""door to the desert.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-movie-set-in-the-desert,"An American-style gas station is waiting for you on the highway out of Ouarzazate. It’s not a hallucination; rather it is the set used for the 2006 horror film The Hills Have Eyes. It was here, at this gas station, that the film’s protagonists are advised to take a gory, gruesome “shortcut.” Even for those who aren’t familiar with the movie, the old station is a chilling sight. Supposedly, the eerie movie set looks so real people occasionally mistake it for an actual gas station. Smashed, weathered cars rust outside. Glass bottles glitter in the trees, and creepy puppets peer out from unexpected places. The gas station sits along the highway that runs through a small commune outside Ouarzazate, a city known as Hollywood’s “door to the desert.” It’s a hotspot for desert-based film sets and on-location shooting. Unfortunately, the “diner” is not accessible, but make sure to take a peek through the window. Old props, like cans of soda and food, glass jars, and a handful of flags, sit undisturbed throughout the space. The dust-coated items make it look like the decrepit diner was abandoned in a hurry.  The abandoned movie set is right along the main highway. There's no entry fee."
16,Atlas Film Studios,"Ouarzazate, Morocco","World's largest film studio, where visitors tour the decaying sets that litter the harsh desert environment.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atlas-film-studios,"Named for its proximity to the Atlas Mountains, a range that stretches across northern Africa, Atlas Film Studios is the largest film studio in the world. Covering more than 322,000 square feet of desert, Atlas Film is located just five miles outside of Ouarzazate on the road to Marrakech and is a popular tourist destination, in part because the grounds are littered with old movie sets that are decaying in the harsh environment. Atlas Film Studios wasn’t built until 1983 when Moroccan entrepreneur Mohamed Belghmi recognized the need for a permanent studio in the area. But Ouarzazate was first used as a movie location by acclaimed British director David Lean for his 1962 epic Lawrence of Arabia. Familiar with the area, Lean knew that the site could provide an authentic setting for any ancient, desert-based story. Over the years, Ouarzazate has served as a shooting location for Alexander the Great, Black Hawk Down, Kingdom of Heaven, Babel, The Mummy (1999), Star Wars (1977), The Living Daylights (1987), Martin Scorsese’s Kundun (1997), and many others, including Ridley Scott’s epic Gladiator (2000), starring Russell Crowe, and Body of Lies (2008) also starring Russell Crowe along with Leonardo DiCaprio. The first thing visitors to Atlas encounter is a massive prop jet plane that was used in 1985’s Jewel of the Nile. Out in the desert, one of the most popular attractions is the Colosseum where Crowe fought in Gladiator. Inside one of the first buildings, there is a replica “kasbah” with winding passageways and alleys. In another area of the studio, there is an Egyptian tomb with 12ft statues guarding the entrance and exit. All in all a great tour with a great guide and well worth the money, but don’t be surprised by the state of disrepair that seems to have swept the site."
17,Legzira Beach,"Tiznit Province, Morocco",Rocky Atlantic beach home to a stunning stone arch.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/legzira-beach,"In between Mirleft and Sidi Ifni can be found Morocco’s most unique beach. Like its other Atlantic counterparts, the 8 km-long stretch of Legzira Beach is windy, rocky, and expansive. What set Legzira apart, however, were its two mammoth stone arches. Naturally formed after years of erosion, these sedimentary giants jutted out into the perpetually crashing waves and are accessible during low-tide. Sadly, only one of the two arches now remains. The other collapsed in late 2016, undermined by wave action. The second arch is probably also at risk of eventual collapse, as the sea continues to wear away at the fragile red sandstone from which it is formed. Being a haven for European para-gliders and surfers, the bongo drums and wetsuits manifest themselves a little ad nauseam, but through the Atlantic mists scraps of Moroccan life, like donkeys and fisherman, can still be found.  20 km south of Mirleft, 800 m after you turn at a sign on the road. Legzira Beach is a must visit for surfers seeking a crowd-free lineup. There are direct shuttle buses to Legzira Beach from the main Moroccan surfing area of Taghazout/Tamraght Get the public bus to going from Tiznit to Sidi Ifni and ask to get out at the Legzira beach turn off, from here it is a one kilometer walk to the beach. If you are coming from Taghazout then you can take a direct shuttle."
18,Ben Youssef Madrasa,"Marrakesh, Morocco",The largest madrasa in Morocco once housed more than 900 students within its exquisite walls.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ben-youssef-madrasa,"The Ben Youssef Madrasa is the largest madrasa in Morocco and one of the largest and most important in North Africa. Founded in the 14th century and later expanded, it ceased to function as an Islamic college in 1960, but remains one of the finest buildings in Marrakesh. The college was founded in the 14th century during the reign of the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hassan, taking its name from the neighboring Ben Youssef Mosque. Initially a modest madrasa, it was later reconstructed during the Saadian Dynasty by the Abdallah al-Ghalib, the second Saadian sultan of Morocco. Upon the completion of these works in 1565, the Ben Youssef Madrasa stood as one of the largest and most splendid theological colleges in North Africa. For more than four centuries, it housed as many as 900 students, an impressive feat considering the cramped nature of the building’s 130 student dormitory cells. The madrasa ceased to function as a college in 1960 but was renovated and opened to the public in 1982. Historical significance aside, the madrasa draws in visitors who come to marvel at its intricate decorations that have drawn comparisons with the Alhambra in Granada, Spain (and leading some to conclude that artists may have been brought from Andalusia to work on the madrasa). Walk along the street outside the madrasa, and you could easily pass by without a second glance at the main entrance, a fairly nondescript wooden door save for an inscription that reads: “You who enter my door, may your highest hopes be exceeded.” But inside lies a cool central courtyard with a marble patio and water basin, the walls and columns decorated with Moorish zellige tiles forming geometrically-patterned mosaics, and sculptures, stuccoes, and cedar windows with carved vines. A prayer hall sits off the main courtyard, and contains some of the most impressive decorations. Here, three naves are bordered by arch-bearing marble pillars with ornamental motifs of pine cones and palms motifs, the walls decorated with Islamic calligraphy and more zellige tile work. Look up and you’ll see a dome crafted from cedar wood with 24 small mosaic windows. Back out in the courtyard, you can see the tiny windows of the student dormitories looking down from the first floor. You can explore the 130 or so cells of the madrasa, some so small you have to crouch down to enter, and some offering slight but atmospheric views of the courtyard below.  As of November 2018, Ben Youssef Madrasa is currently closed for renovation works and is expected to reopen in 2020. Once it reopens, the opening hours are likely to be the same as before, opening daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The entrance fee will probably be around $5 US. The madrasa is located at Place Ben Youssef, next to Ben Youssef Mosque and close to the Museum de Marrakech."
19,Kasbah Aït Benhaddou,"Aït Ben Haddou, Morocco","A fortified city, home to a remaining population of five families",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kasbah-ait-benhaddou,"As this fortified city full of towering kasbahs and crumbling walls took beatings from the brutal rains, its citizens defected into more modern digs on the other side of the Ounila River, except for a stubborn few that remain in the formerly majestic ksar. While in the 1940s, more than 90 families were living in the Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou, today only five families are still living inside the fortress. A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987, Aït Benhaddou was once a major stop along the caravan route between Marrakech and the Sahara. The striking visage of southern Moroccan architecture is thought to be 17th-century and contains a mosque, two cemeteries (Jewish and Muslim), a public square, and areas for threshing grain outside of the ramparts. Despite not being completely abandoned, the earthen architecture is vulnerable to weather and lack of care. While the site has maintained its authenticity, the lack of maintenance and its sparsity of inhabitants led to serious deterioration. Assigned a five-year plan by officials, the ksar received some care and restoration between 2007 and 2012, using as much wood and as many earthen techniques as possible to keep the site historically preserved. One of the remaining families opened a traditional café to give visitors an overview of the ancient lifestyle in the fortress and as a way to preserve their tradition and heritage. The Kasbah was a set for many international films and TV shows, like Game of Thrones, Laurence of Arabia, and Gladiator."
20,Saadian Tombs,"Marrakesh, Morocco","Deliberately hidden for centuries, the magnificent Saadian Tombs were eventually uncovered in 1917.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saadiantombs,"The Saadian Tombs are a series of sepulchers and mausoleums in Marrakech that house the remains of important figures from the Saadi Dynasty, which ruled Morocco from 1549 to 1659. Shortly after the fall of the dynasty, the tombs were sealed off and hidden, only to be rediscovered in 1917. The royal necropolis on which the Saadian Tombs were built was likely in use since the beginning of the 14th century. But it was during the reign of Ahmed el-Mansour, the Saadi Sultan from 1578 to 1603, that the tombs reached a far more prominent and lavish status. Ahmed el-Mansour’s father, Mohammed ash-Sheikh, was buried at the site after his murder in 1557. Not long after, Ahmed el-Mansour began to enlarge and embellish the entire burial ground, including the construction of two magnificent mausoleums for his father, his mother, his own descendants and, of course, himself. His own mausoleum, the Hall of Twelve Columns, was built from imported Italian Carrara marble, with gilding honeycomb muqarnas, a type of ornamented vaulting, decorated with gold. He shares his mausoleum with some of his closest family members and descendents, including Princess Zorha, whose tomb carries the epitaph, “Here is the tomb of the noble lady, new moon, marvel of virtues.” Between the two mausoleums and throughout the gardens lie many more tombs, including a prominent chamber for Ahmed el-Mansour’s mother, Lalla Messaouda, who was buried in 1591. In total, 66 princes and other prominent figures lie in the Saadian Tombs, as well as more than 100 chancellors and wives, each resting closer to the Sultan’s mausoleum depending on his or her status. These include the graves of a number of trusted Jewish advisers, some of who, judging by their location, were highly valued by the Sultan. The very existence of the Saadian Tombs was placed in doubt with the end of the Saadi Dynasty. Less than two decades after the end of Saadian rule, along came a man who certainly deserves a brief digression. This man was Moulay Ismail ibn Sharif, the second ruler of the Moroccan Alaouite dynasty, who reigned from 1672 to 1727. Moulay Ismail, variously known as the “Warrior King” and “The Bloodthirsty,” had a penchant for adorning his city walls with the heads of his victims, which totaled an estimated 30,000 during his rule. He also had a fondness for concubines, which numbered around 2,000, and multiple wives (including, incidentally, an Irishwoman named Mrs. Shaw). In between torturing laborers and beheading servants, he managed to father 867 children (525 sons and 342 daughters), an achievement recognized by Guinness World Records. When he came to power, Moulay Ismail wanted to erase all evidence of the magnificent Saadi Dynasty. He set about destroying and stripping many of the dynasty’s greatest buildings, including the El Badi Palace. But when it came to the Saadian Tombs, he showed a surprising amount of restraint, fearful of committing sacrilege by destroying a burial ground. Instead, he built a wall around the tombs, leaving only a small passage from the nearby Kasbah Mosque. Thereafter, the Saadian Tombs lay untouched and neglected for more than two centuries, the mausoleums attracting little more than weeds, stray cats and storks. Then, in 1917, a French aerial photography survey sighted the ruins. The rediscovered tombs were promptly uncovered and restored, and soon opened to the public in all their former glory.  The Saadian Tombs are located along Rue de la Kasbah near the Kasbah Mosque and not far from the ruins of the El Badi Palace. Opening hours are Monday to Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The entrance fee is 70 dirham."
21,Macuti Lighthouse and Shipwreck,"Beira, Mozambique",This rusted shipwreck directly in front of a century-old abandoned lighthouse looks almost surreal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/macuti-lighthouse-and-shipwreck,"If you find yourself in Beira, Mozambique, it’s well worth a visit to Macuti Beach to witness this unusual scene: the remains of an old shipwreck lying on the sand directly in front of a mysterious abandoned lighthouse. At high tide, only a few rusted bulkheads are visible above the breakers, but at low tide, you can walk or wade right through the wreckage. In the light of early morning or late afternoon, the place has an almost surreal, brooding vibe. The red-and-white-striped Macuti Lighthouse (the beach is named after it) has stood here since 1904, but has been derelict for almost the last 20 years. In 1985, a seagoing tug, also christened “Macuti,” was intentionally run aground directly in front of the old lighthouse to serve as a breakwater. It seems like an ironic and inglorious end for a vessel that was once important enough to be featured on a Mozambican postage stamp. During the day, especially on weekends, the lighthouse and beach are a popular local hangout. Prepare for scores of locals enjoying the sun. Get a drink from one of the many bars nearby and sip as you sit at the foot of the lighthouse looking out at what’s left of the Macuti. Visit at after dark on a clear night, at low tide (about 11 p.m.), for the most enchanting views.  Macuti Beach is along the main coast road between Beira city and the airport. The red and white lighthouse is plainly visible from the road. Some people have been able to get inside and climb to the top of the lighthouse for a commanding view of the beach and shipwreck."
22,The Lion House,"Gorongosa, Mozambique","When humans abandoned this safari lodge, the lions took over.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-lion-house-gorongosa-mozambique,"The Gorongosa region, located in Great African Rift Valley in central Mozambique, is one of the most biodiverse places on the planet, and it has made efforts to preserve its unique ecosystems since the 1920s. By 1940 the wildlife reserve was such a popular attraction a safari lodge was built to accommodate tourists. Unfortunately, it was built right on a floodplain. Every year during the rainy season, the Mussicadzi River would flood the building, and the lodge was abandoned before it was even fully completed. But one man’s trash is another man’s treasure — or in this case, a pride of large wild cats. When humans abandoned the lodge, the lions moved in. The empty structure was named the Lion House (or “Casa dos Leões” as Portuguese is the official language of Mozambique) and lions have occupied it ever since. In 1960, Gorongosa became a national park, and today the magnificent animals and their unexpected residence in the deserted building are a famous landmark at Gorongosa National Park. For generations lions have been coming back to the house, even guarding it like their own territory, a curious behavior for a wild animal. Some of the lions — the park estimates there are 30 to 50 living on the reserve — use it as a safe haven for their cubs and a place to take shelter from the rain. The animals are known to ascend to the roof of the building for a better vantage point from which to watch their prey for hours, carefully choosing the best warthog or bushbuck to target for their next meal. And of course they use the house to do what cats do best: lie around and nap. Being at the top of the food chain has its advantages."
23,Maputo Natural History Museum,"Maputo, Mozambique","From neon green watering holes to bleached elephant foetuses, this Mozambique museum makes natural history weird.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maputo-natural-history-museum,"Maputo, Mozambique’s Natural History Museum is housed inside a beautiful old building with nicely kept gardens. The collection includes many artifacts you would expect to find in a natural history museum, including descriptions of animal migration, ancient pottery, and a small ethnology exhibit, but it is also home to elephant foetuses and dioramas full of neon water. While the building housing the museum features a number of exhibits, but the largest amount of space is given to its aging taxidermy centerpiece. A majority of the ground floor is a crowded arrangement of preserved animals native to this part of Africa. The animals appear to be in various states of disrepair and include what museum guides claim is a pair of paper maché rhinos, created to replace the real rhinos, which had been stolen from the museum. Some of the trophy creatures are posed in deadly battle, while the majority of the menagerie are gathered around a strip of neon green watering holes. The unnatural color seems a bit strange, but is not unheard of in the natural world. Spared from both the watering hole and the battles, is a well-preserved honey badger, digging a hole in its own glass case. Not far from the taxidermy menagerie on the ground floor is also an eerie display of elephant fetuses behind glass. The half-formed giants are presented in a gradually more mature state of development. Although at no point are the foetuses anything less than a bit unsettling.  Located on the roundabout where Rua dos Lusiadas and Avenida Patrice Lumumba come together (not far from the Hotel Cardoso), the Natural History Museum is easy to find."
24,Grande Hotel of Beira,"Beira, Mozambique","Once living up to its name as the grandest hotel in all of Africa, the Grande Hotel is now home to a community of squatters.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grande-hotel-of-beira,"In what was once an Olympic-sized pool, women wash their laundry in the questionable water, murky and still, as children chase each other around its length. Inside the four-story Art Deco structure, families cram themselves into every available room and corridor, fighting off rats, centipedes, and sometimes each other. Trash spills from every available space, the smell of urine and sweat hangs in the air, and light switches and faucets produce nothing. 2,000-3,000 people live here together, doing their best to keep it as safe and clean as possible, but the challenges of open elevator shafts, desperation and overcrowding are daunting. Welcome to the Grande Hotel of Beira, a luxurious getaway for the colonial elite, once thought to be the most splendid hotel on the continent of Africa. Built in the 1950s during Portuguese rule, the Grande Hotel was a vision of opulence. Parquet floors gleamed, chandeliers lit up the art on the walls and ornate décor. Elevators delivered guests to their lavish rooms with balconies looking out at a stunning view of the Indian Ocean, and across the decadent pool area. When the Liberation front of Mozambique rose up and civil war began to sweep across the country, the owners of the Grande Hotel fled, abandoning the property. It was used a refugee camp as the war raged on, but once it ended, the battered building was taken over by homeless citizens made destitute by the decades of unrest. The once magnificent building, while still grand in stature, has made the complete journey from playground to slum. The parquet floors were ripped out long ago and burned for heat, everything that could be sold, burned or used has been stripped out of every inch of the property. The elevator shafts are empty, floors collapse, and trees grow up through balconies and terraces. Political posters hang tattered against graffiti-filled walls, smiling and promising something better. The slum has a loose organizational structure, a mediator that helps work out disputes, a cleaning schedule that residents must adhere to, and two rules which everyone must try to follow to the best of their abilities: “Keep the Cleanliness and the Respect.” While somewhat dangerous, the hotel can be visited; residents sell produce and fish in the courtyard, and the government promotes classes for the children that live there. Talk of tearing it down or kicking the squatters out is met with resistance, especially when no alternative living space is being offered. Ironically, a room at the Grande Hotel of Beira is in higher demand than it ever was when it was in operation."
25,Kolmanskop Ghost Town,Namibia,The remains of diamond fever taken over by the desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kolmanskop,"People flocked to what became known as Kolmanskop, Namibia, after the discovery of diamonds in the area in 1908 by Zacharias Lewala, a railway worker, who picked up what he thought was an unusually shiny stone, and showed it to his supervisor. The supervisor, August Stauch, immediately applied for a prospector’s license, and verification confirmed that the first diamond in the region had been found. The diamonds were in such supply that they could be picked off the ground by bare hands, and soon the area was flooded with men wanting to make their fortune. As people arrived with high hopes, houses and other key buildings were built. The new town, which was German-influenced, saw the construction of ballrooms, casinos, theaters, ice factories, and hospitals, as well as the first X-ray station in the southern hemisphere. Prior to World War I, over 2000 pounds (1000 kilos) of diamonds were sifted from the sands of the Namib desert, and Kolmanskop became a diamond boom town. During the war, however, the price of diamonds dropped considerably. On top of this, larger diamonds were later found south of Kolmanskop, in Oranjemund. People picked up and chased after the precious stones. By 1956, the town was completely abandoned. Today, the eerie ghost town is a popular tourist destination. Guided tours take visitors around the town and through the houses which, today, are filled only with sand.  Kolmanskop can be visited between 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Schedule varies depending on the day of the week. There are one or more guided tours which are included in the ticket price. The guided portion lasts about an hour with information given in both English and German. Afterwards or before, there is time to wander around by yourself, and take photos or explore inside many of the sand-filled houses. Tickets are available at Luederitz Tours & Safaris in Bismarck Street and on site."
26,Eduard Bohlen Shipwreck,Namibia,"Far from the shore, this sandy victim of the Skeleton Coast looks like it was plopped in the middle of the desert.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eduard-bohlen-shipwreck,"The Skeleton Coast is a strip of desolate, unforgiving earth; a place where parched desert dunes ripple toward the Atlantic Ocean. Sailors, having wrecked their vessels in the heavy fog that spills off the land most mornings, found themselves trading life at sea for a hot, hellish terrain. One particular shipwreck feels like a fitting reminder of the coast’s foreboding loneliness. Trapped within a veil of thick fog, the Eduard Bohlen ran aground along Namibia’s Skeleton Coast on September 5th, 1909. The 310-foot-long cargo ship now lies partially buried beneath the sand, destined never to complete its journey from Swakopmund to Table Bay. Strangely, the ship appears to be stranded within the middle of the desert. In the years after it sank, the desert began encroaching upon the shoreline. It’s more than 1,000 feet away from the water, making it a must-see for wreck enthusiasts, history buffs, and intrepid desert explorers alike. Wind-whipped waves of sand have replaced the ocean water that once lapped at its rusting remains. Jackals occasionally hole up inside when seeking refuge from the relentless sun. The Skeleton Coast has become an unplanned ship graveyard of sorts, dooming the vessels and their sailors to a dry desert end. Shipwrecks litter the land around the Eduard Bohlen. Some still remain within the ocean’s grasp, while others are now no more than a few pieces of wood poking out from the sand."
27,Namib Sand Sea,Namibia,"A desert that rolls right up to the ocean, where it's so dry animals live off the fog.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/namib-sand-sea,"The beautiful red sand of the Namib Sand Sea flows right up to the actual waves of the ocean. It’s one of the world’s only coastal deserts, with dune fields winding over its three million hectares. There are two dune systems at work here, one that is ancient and one that is young. It’s also known as the world’s oldest desert, believed to have been formed by the erosion of materials from thousands of kilometers away. While it is incredibly arid, with fog as the primary source of water, the desert still boasts a wide array of endemic wildlife, including the Welwitschia plant, the Dune Lark, and various reptiles and invertebrates. The Namib Sand Sea was named an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013."
28,Dead Vlei,"Sossusvlei, Namibia","This ""dead marsh"" sits among the largest sand dunes in the world, a forest frozen in time.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dead-vlei,"Among the towering red dunes of Namib-Naukluft National Park in the central Namib Desert is an area known as Sossusvlei. It is a strange and alien landscape. The rich red dunes that surround the area owe their hue to age—over the thousands of years, the sand has literally rusted. Sossusvlei is a wide, flat, salt-covered expanse with a dense and compact layer of clay in the subsoil. When dry, Sossusvlei is hard and arid, and when wet, as it gets every 5-10 years when fed by the Tsauchab River, it becomes sticky and plastic. The area is the river’s final destination. Even in the wettest of years, the water soaks into the salt/clay pan, giving the area its nickname: “place of no return.” Altogether the blue sky, red dunes, and white pans make a striking vision, reminiscent of movies such as The Fall, The Cell, and Steel Dawn. Nearby is yet another “place of no return” this one even older, and much more dead than Sossusvlei. Known as Dead Vlei or “dead marsh” (vlei being Afrikaans for a type of marsh), it is found among the tallest dunes in the world—some reach 1,312 feet high, which is almost as lofty as the Empire State Building. Dead Vlei was once like Sossusvlei, with the river draining into it nourishing desert life and even trees. But no longer. Some 900 years ago the climate dried up, and dunes cut off Dead Vlei from the river. It became too dry in Dead Vlei for the trees to even decompose. They simply scorched black in the sun, monuments to their own destruction. The trees, now over 1000 years old, form a barren forest. The area, however, is not entirely without life. Salsola shrubs and clumps of Nara melon stay alive by subsisting off of morning mists. It is a 44-mile drive from the park gates to the dunes of Sossusvlei and Dead Vlei. One of the many reasons to go is to experience the sunrise (or sunset) over the huge red sand dunes of the Namib desert. The skies are among the clearest on the planet.  Drive to Namib-Nauklaft Sossusvlei is the better part of a day's drive from Windhoek. There are some rather difficult mountain passes on some secondary roads, so you'll have to choose your route wisely if you don't bring a high-clearance vehicle (there are several routes from Windhoek). The best route without nasty mountain passes would be from the south-central town of Mariental. On the other hand, the passes provide excellent viewpoints. The road from the accommodations in Sesriem to Sossusvlei itself is tarred almost all the way, although this was the worst tarred sealed road in Namibia. The road is now well maintained and in good condition. On the last 5 km you have to drive through sand, so you will need an all-wheel vehicle"
29,Fairy Circles of Southern Africa,Namibia,"Unexplained bald patches in the landscape grow and recede over time, as though they are somehow alive.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fairy-circles-southern-africa,"They call them footprints of the gods. Whether in the thickly tufted prairie grass of the southern plains or in the dry stalks of vegetation in the dusty foothills, something is happening in Southern Africa. It doesn’t really matter what the climate or soil conditions are, or who is there to see it or not, or what grazing pattern the local wildlife happens to follow. Rings are forming in the ground. Perfectly round, almost too-good-to-be-true rings, in fact. But they are true, and they are naturally occurring, so far as anyone can tell. The small, circular patches of bare ground form like bald spots in the otherwise thick grass or fields in Namibia and South Africa, where humans often don’t set foot. Their mysterious origin has lead them to be called “Fairy Circles” colloquially, and legends ranging from local tales of god’s footprints to international recognition as a “UFO hot spot” have sprouted up in short order. But the Fairy Circles are not grand designs like their distant paranormal cousins, crop circles, and bona fide scientific research has led to the conclusion that not only do they occur naturally, but they grow and shrink over time, as if they were alive. Examination of the soil in and around the circles reveals no abnormal insects or parasites, no unusual fungus to speak of. All science has discovered thus far is that they’re not a hoax. Popular hypotheses about their cause include mold or spores that kill off the grass, the radiating pattern of growth of which would certainly explain the odd circular shape; or wind or soil erosion, which would do less to explain the patterns but has been observed elsewhere and found to cause “bald spots.” For now, the odd formations are both intriguing and entertaining to nearby residents as well as botanists and UFO enthusiasts the world over. For all the predictable supernatural talk about the Fairy Circles occupying, representing or otherwise creating a path to another world, they do in fact occupy a strange and unreal dimension—that rare place and time after which a phenomenon has been discovered, but before it is blandly explained away like so many lights in the sky. For now, the only certainty is the mystery."
30,Shipwreck Lodge,Namibia,Ten shipwreck-shaped chalets lie along the sand dunes on Namibia’s Skeleton Coast.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shipwreck-lodge,"Inspired by the shipwrecks that dot Namibia’s Skeleton Coast, the Shipwreck Lodge sits in one of the country’s most stunning but least visited national parks. Namibia’s Skeleton Coast might not sound like a good place for a holiday. Portuguese sailors referred to the coast as “The Gates of Hell”. The indigenous people of the Namibian interior called it “The Land God Made in Anger.” And then there are the skeletons that give the region its name, initially derived from the whale and seal bones left on the shore by the whaling industry, and later associated with the skeletons of more than 1,000 shipwrecks that dot the region, victims of the coast’s rocks, fog and heavy surf. Namibia itself has the second-lowest population density of any sovereign country (after Mongolia), and the Skeleton Coast is one of the least populated areas in the country. The climate, too, is not what you’d call hospitable. So, holiday anyone? Well, the Shipwreck Lodge might well tempt you to visit this remote land of sand dunes and shipwrecks. Located between the Hoarusib and Hoanib rivers in Skeleton Coast National Park, the lodge features 10 chalets designed to resemble the shipwrecks that give the region its name. Designed by Nina Maritz Architects and opened in 2018, the 10 cabins of the 20-bed luxury lodge were in part created to capture the “sense of harshness and desolation that shipwrecked passengers and sailors experienced in earlier times,” according to the architects. And building these lodges was no easy task. Being in the middle of nowhere was a logistical challenge, and then there was the incessant coastal wind, which continually blew sand away from the footings. Even now, frequent maintenance is required to make sure the cabins stay firmly affixed to their supporting poles embedded deep within the sand. But don’t let all this desolation fool you: the Skeleton Coast certainly has its charms. As well as being a destination for adventurous shipwreck hunters, the Skeleton Coast National Park has plenty of wildlife spotting opportunities. The harsh but beautiful desert landscape is home to flora and fauna that have adapted to live in the extreme aridity, including plants and insects that depend on the thick sea fogs that roll across the coast. And the riverbeds further inland sustain giraffes, lions, brown hyenas, springbok and critically endangered black rhinoceros, all of whom get much of their water from wells dug by the local baboons and elephants. A stay at the Shipwreck Lodge, therefore, isn’t just a chance to get a sense of shipwrecked isolation, albeit in a luxury hull-like cabin with an onsite restaurant handily eliminating the threat of starvation. When you’re not marveling at the sunset from atop one of the seemingly endless dunes, you can go wildlife spotting, fishing and, of course, shipwreck hunting.  Shipwreck Lodge is located on the north coast of Namibia, inside the Skeleton Coast National Park, about 25 miles north of Möwe Bay. Guests are picked up at Möwe Bay and transported to the lodge in a closed game drive vehicle. Current room rates start at N$ 8,685 ($625 US) per person for a double room."
31,Hoba Meteorite,Namibia,The largest known meteorite on Earth was too big to move.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hoba-meteorite-near-grootfontein-namibia,"As the largest known meteorite known on earth, you would think that this 60-ton iron-nickel meteorite would have left an immense blast crater when it fell to earth nearly 80 million years ago. As you head down the dusty roads into the valley where the Farm Hoba is located, the black rock running through the sides of the surrounding hills look as if there was a massive explosion. No one is certain how the meteorite arrived in that spot; it may have bounced across the earth from the original impact site to its present site. The large cuboid shape (about 3-by-3 meters around and 1 meter high) was discovered in 1920 by the owner of the farm, Jacobus Hermanus Brits, when his plow struck it. Brits heard a metallic clang, and his oxen couldn’t pull the plow any further. The American Museum of Natural History in New York City tried to purchase the meteorite in 1954 but couldn’t move it, and the site was declared a National Monument in 1955, though you couldn’t visit it until 1985. The site has now been improved with a pleasant grassy garden and picnic area, as well as easy access to the meteorite.

32,Welwitschia,Namibia,Bizarre living fossil only grows in a small chunk of the Namib Desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/welwitschia,"Stretching through Angola and Namibia on the southwest coast of Africa, the Namib Desert gets less than a half inch of rain per year. It’s a completely barren landscape, deathly hot and mostly devoid of life, save a little flora and fauna including a bizarre plant that can live for centuries in the arid Namib. Known as the tweeblaarkanniedood (“two-leaf-cannot-die”) in Afrikaans, the easier-pronounced word for the plant is Welwitschia, named for the Austrian scientist who studied it in the mid-19th century. Although it almost looks dead, piled in a heap on the desert sand, Welwitschia is a powerfully-evolved survivor. Able to intake moisture from fog over the Namib, it can live for hundreds of years, and some of the oldest known Welwitschia are 2000 years old. What one sees above ground is only the tip of the iceberg so to speak, is actually a bizarre tree with a large, mostly underground taproot-like trunk with corky bark and high water storage capacity. The plant has only two strap-like leathery leaves, growing constantly from the same spot for the entirety of the plant’s life. These leaves split apart into smaller straps as they grow, giving the illusion of many leaves. Apparently related to the conifers, welwitschia are dioceous, meaning that they grow as separate male and female plants. Welwitschias belong to a small order of gymnosperms (cone-bearers, Latin for “naked seed”) called gnetophytes. This order is comprised of three families Welwitschiaceae, Ephedraceae (the ephedra family), and Gnetaceae (the Gnetum family), and each of these families only have one genus, for which they are named. The gnetophyte order is believed by many botanists to be a genetic and morphological (with special focus on the growth and form of their microsporangia in the pollen structures) missing link between the cone-bearers and the true flowering plants (the angiosperms), and it is possible that members of this order were the very first plants to be insect-pollinated. Considered by many to be a living fossil, the strange plants are coveted, and as such are growing endangered. They are protected only by their position deep in the Namib desert, which is difficult to traverse. There is some effort by botanic gardens specializing in desert flora to propagate the welwitschia and get rid of its endangered status."
33,Quiver Tree Forest,"Keetmanshoop, Namibia",A rare cluster of alien-like plants grows along a dusty highway.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/quiver-tree-forest,"Because these wonky plants prefer to grow almost exclusively atop medium-to-large dolerite rock formations, they normally grow great distances from each other. But in a small rocky pocket outside of Keetmanshoop, a large number of them grow in uncharacteristically close proximity, creating a forest-like landscape. It’s one of the only known naturally occurring such sites in the world. Despite its name, the Quiver Tree (Aloidendron dichotomum) is not a true tree, but rather a species of Aloe capable of growing over 30 feet tall. Declared a National Monument of Namibia on June 1, 1995, the Quiver Tree Forest has been privately owned by Coenie and Ingrid Nolte since 1990. The two operate a working farm and guesthouse adjacent to the forest and permit travelers to hike around the property, even offering the occasional night tour. All of the trees in the forest are naturally occurring and self-propagating. You’ll find young trees growing out of rock crevasses, and the oldest trees in the forest are estimated to be between 200 and 300 years old. The unusual micro-ecosystem this forest creates also attracts a surprising abundance of wildlife, most notably a large population of rock hyrax, which hikers will almost certainly find (or hear) scurrying among the rocks. The plants are as culturally important as they are interesting to admire. They’re regarded as a national symbol of Namibia and are featured on the currency and in popular imagery. Traditional medicine uses the plants’ roots to treat both asthma and tuberculosis. The Quiver Tree takes its name from its Afrikaans name, Kokerboom, which is a reference to the indigenous San peoples’ practice of hollowing out the tubular branches to make quivers for their arrows (they’re known as choje in the San language). The trees are scientifically fascinating, too. Their bark is covered in a white powdery substance that’s used to reflect much of the sun’s heat. The plants are also capable of a rare botanical practice known as self-amputation, which allows them to shed diseased limbs to prevent sudden infections from spreading and remove extra limbs in times of drought.  The Quiver Tree Forest is a safe place to hike. The best time to visit is between June and July, when the trees are flowering. But be aware that you are hiking in a naturally occurring, rocky space. It is best to wear boots or at the least, closed-toed shoes. Be careful of your footing and watch for snakes. Also, be aware of the intense daytime heat and sun exposure. Wear sunscreen, don a hat, and bring a water bottle to stave off heat stroke and sunburn. Entrance ticket also includes access to Giant's Playground which is owned by the same owners. It is not possible to buy tickets separately."
34,Tropic of Capricorn Crossing,Namibia,Road signs in Namibia mark the location of one of the five major circles of latitude.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tropic-of-capricorn-crossing,"On the way between Sossusvlei and Walvis Bay in Namibia, two colorful signs, one on each side of the road, mark the crossing of the Tropic of Capricorn. You will see this sign again if you drive on the road that connects Keetmanshoop with Windhoek just after Mariental if going north. One of the five major circles of latitude, the Tropic of Capricorn runs parallel to the equator and is the southernmost latitude where the sun can shine from directly overhead. It currently marks the latitude 23.5 degrees south. However, the Tropic of Capricorn isn’t a truly fixed location. It tends to creep northward each year, making the road signs a slightly inaccurate geographic marker. The Tropic of Capricorn passes through a number of countries including Argentina, Australia, Botswana, Brazil, Chile, Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa, Namibia, and Paraguay. If you consider its starting place to be the Prime Meridian, it first makes landfall on the coast of Namibia. The signs are a popular photo spot on the drive through the Namibian desert and many visitors mark the crossing by placing a sticker or signature on the sign.  Loacted on the C14 in Namibia, approximately 1 hour after passing through Solitaire en route to Walvis Bay. Signs are located on both sides of the road so there is no need to cross the sometimes busy route."
35,The Gibeon Meteorites,"Windhoek, Namibia",A public display of prehistoric space rocks is named for the Namibian village where they were found.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-gibeon-meteorites-windhoek-namibia,"About 600 million years ago, a massive meteoroid hurtled through space before crashing into the land that would, many millennia later, become known as Namibia. While on its Earthbound journey, it shattered, sending more than 100 meteorites shooting toward the planet, leaving blazing trails in their wake. A large portion of the space rocks were found around the village of Gibeon, earning them the name Gibeon Meteorites. Even before the start of the Iron Age, local people used the meteorites to make iron tools and weapons. The space rocks gained international attention after Captain J.E. Alexander, an Englishman, found them during his 1838 travels. He sent a sample back to London, where prominent astronomer Sir John Herschel noticed its high quantity of nickel and declared it came from an iron meteorite. Upwards of 150 meteorites were tracked and recovered since the captain’s 19th-century report, though quite a few of the valuable specimens were either stolen and smuggled out of the country or donated to various international research institutions. However, 30 of these prehistoric extraterrestrial wonders are available for all to see on the Post Street Mall in Windhoek. They were declared a National Monument in February of 1950.  The meteorite display in the Post Street Mall is open 24 hours a day."

Etjo.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dinosaur-footprints-on-the-otjihaenamaparero-farm,"Near the center of Namibia, in the Kalkveld region, midway between the B1 and the C33 highways is the farm Otjihaenamaparero. There exposed in the Etjo sandstone are 200-million-year-old dinosaur footprints that you can walk alongside. These types of fossils, such as footprints, burrows, and feeding marks are also known as “trace fossils” or “ichnofossils.” There are two sets of tracks, and the first set that you come upon are the smaller coelophysis rhodesiensis (formerly called syntarsus) tracks ( a 10-foot-long pack hunter) that run for about 12 meters. The second set, a short distance away, are of ceratosaurus (a 20-foot-long hunter with a large nose-horn on its skull). There are two tracks that cross each other, one which runs about 30 meters and the other about 40 meters. Nearby on the farm, visitors can camp, shower, enjoy braai (Namibian barbecue), or stay in the farm’s guest house."
37,Elizabeth Bay Ghost Town,"Elizabeth Bay, Namibia",The ruins of this mining boom town stand like skeletal reminders of the settlement's dark history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elizabeth-bay,"Though it often seems to be forgotten in the shadow of its ghost town counterpart, Kolmanskop, Elizabeth Bay was another lucrative diamond mining town that is worth exploring. It feels closer to urban exploration, and its decrepit buildings and machinery tell of a dark, greedy history. It was operational for only 20 years, but Elizabeth Bay still boasted an immense wealth of diamonds. As a result, German miners flooded the town, building their own miniature Germany along the coast of Namibia. A large entertainment hall and casino were built overlooking the ocean. The town also housed monstrous machinery for desalinating ocean water, rows of housing for German miners, and large, overcrowded buildings for local workers. While the German workers enjoyed proper housing, the Namibian miners were subjected to slave conditions. Their housing and washrooms were all shared. The buildings where they slept contained cot-size beds separated by a small wall divider. About 20 beds ran along each side of the buildings and in some, rows were stacked on top of each other forcing more men into the desolate conditions. The doors to these “houses” were locked at night and their windows were small and high off the ground to discourage any workers from escaping overnight. After a quick flash of success, the town closed in 1948. Then, in 1991, a new Elizabeth Bay mine was opened and is still in operation today. The remains of the original still stand, weather-torn and beaten but still impressive as they capture the endeavors of when the town was at its peak.  The old town of Elizabeth Bay is part of the Namdeb restricted zone. Tours and required permits, however, can be arranged with companies like Namib Offroad Excursions."
38,Bwabwata National Park,Namibia,"Known as ""The People's Park,"" this verdant oasis is home to elephants and villagers alike.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bwabwata-national-park,"Unlike the desert lands of the rest of Namibia, the Bwabwata National Park is fertile and green thanks to the rainfall and the nearby Cunbango River. Located in the Caprivi Strip, Bwabwata is home to both people and wildlife alike, earning it the nickname, The People’s Park. Established back in 2007, the Bwabwata National Park is roughly 6,274 square kilometers and known as a key migration route for African elephants traveling from Southern Angola to Chobe National Park in Botswana. Known collectively as the KAZA region, five countries collaborate to protect the majestic pachyderms’ seasonal path: Namibia, Botswana, Angola, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. A survey was conducted by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism in Namibia to and it was found that, in addition to the elephants that pass through Bwabwata, the park is home to an estimated 5,500 people. According to the ministry, “the survey laid the foundation for the current management approach in the park, which incorporates the needs of the people living there. The survey also laid the foundation for the zoning of the park, which has a core conservation area in the west along the Okavango River, a multiple use area in the central part of the park and a core conservation area in the east along the Kwando River.” The co-existence of man and animal in the Bwabwata National Park has led to united conservation efforts to both protect the park’s wildlife and improve the lives of the local Caprivian people.  Local, private tour operators offer day-trips into the park, while tourism facilities can be found outside the park perimeters, including lodges such as Ngepi Camp, Ndhovu Lodge, and Nunda Safari Lodge."

40,Shark Island,"Luderitz, Namibia","This deceptively beautiful island was once home to a German concentration camp and known as ""Death Island.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shark-island,"Shark Island was founded in 1795 off the coast of Luderitz, Namibia. Originally named Star Island, the land sat amidst immense winds and crashing waters of the Atlantic for a century before it was connected to the mainland and used as a brutal concentration camp by the Germans from 1904 to 1908. Like many other European nations, Germany established several African colonies in the 19th century. The native inhabitants, which included the Herero, Nama and Khoikhoi peoples, attempted to accommodate and resist German power. As more German settlers arrived, they appropriated increasing amounts of land and resources, and came to rely on coerced and enslaved labor. Although the Herero people resisted, the Germans had greater resources, which they used to annihilate the Herero population. Survivors were sent to a concentration camp on Shark Island, which came to be known as Death Island because of the stories of its brutal conditions, minuscule food rations, and the death toll. It was home to the German physician Dr. Bofinger, who was said to conduct sinister racial science experiments and inhumane trials, such as testing whether scurvy was contagious by injecting prisoners with opium and arsenic. On Shark Island, the Herero and Nama peoples were beaten and starved and forced into slavery. The German geneticist Eugen Fischer ran medical breeding experiments to study their physical and mental attributes of the people imprisoned in the camp. More than 3,000 skulls belonging to the Herero and Nama people were sent back to Germany for further experimentation. Racist ideas developed in the colony were brought back to German institutions, where Fischer’s studies would eventually be read by Adolf Hitler. One of Fischer’s students, Joseph Mengele, later conducted human experimentation and sent people to their death in the Auschwitz gas chambers. The camp closed in 1907 and prisoners were transferred to an open area near Radford Bay where mortality rates eventually declined. Today, the harrowing peninsula is the site of a small memorial and plenty of open space for history buffs to go camping.  During the day, there is a small fee of 10 Namibian Dollars to enter and tour the island. Access up onto the lighthouse is possible but not advised on particularly windy days. Just ask for the key from the guard. There are bathrooms and grills on site as well as electrical connections for campers. Further accommodations and camping rates can be found on the Shark Island website."
41,Dabous Giraffes,Niger,These ancient giraffes are the largest known animal petroglyphs in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dabous-giraffes,"In the heart of the Sahara lies the Tenere Desert, a flat, waterless wilderness that means “emptiness” in the Tamacheck language of the local Tuareg nomads. We are more familiar with the Arabic word with the same meaning: sahra (Sahara). On the far side of the Aïr mountains lie more than 800 petroglyphs, including an exceptional carving of two towering giraffes. The Dabous Giraffes were first recorded by Christian Dupuy in 1987. Subsequent field trips brought more attention to the site, and more than 820 individual images have since been found engraved on rocks in the area. Around 700 of these petroglyphs represent animals, including buffalo, ostriches, antelope, lions, camels, and rhinoceros. About 60 petroglyphs represent humans, and 160 or so are open to interpretation. But it’s the two large giraffes that are the real jewels of the collection. Believed to be between 6,000 and 8,000 years old, the pair of giraffes are engraved onto the gently sloping, weathered surface of a large sandstone rock. Various techniques were used to create them, including scraping and smoothing of certain areas, the deep engraving of the outlines, and low-relief carving of the dots all over the body, which are two to three centimeters deep. For such ancient petroglyphs, the detail is truly impressive. Then there’s the sheer size of the carvings. The two giraffes are believed to represent a male and a female, with the larger male in front and the smaller female standing behind. The larger of the two is almost 18 feet tall (5.4 meters), or 21.4 feet tall (6.35 meters) when measured from the tip of its ears to the extremity of its hind leg. This makes it the largest petroglyph in the world, and the largest known rock carving of an animal. Intriguingly, each giraffe also has an etched line leading down from its mouth to an engraved human figure below (something found in other ancient representations of giraffes in the Sahara). Does this perhaps represent a symbolic relationship between giraffes and humans or, more practically, ancient attempts at domestication?  The Dabous Giraffes and surrounding petroglyphs are located about half-way between the towns of Agadez and Arlit, on the western side of the Aïr Mountains in north-central Niger. A road runs between the two towns, and the petroglyphs are located a few miles west of the road. An aluminum cast of the giraffes, made from a mold of the carvings, stands at the airport in Agadez."
42,Last Tree of Ténéré,"Tchirozérine, Niger","The most remote tree in the world survived desertification, but not a drunk truck driver.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/last-tree-tenere,"The Ténéré wastelands of northeastern Niger were once populated by a forest of trees. By the 20th century, desertification had wiped out all but one solitary acacia. The Tree of Ténéré, as it came to be called, had no companions for 400 kilometers in every direction. Its roots reached nearly 40 meters deep into the sand. The tree had become a sacred object among the nomadic Tuareg people that would pass by it on their journeys, never using it for firewood, or allowing their camels to graze on it. As more desert explorers came across the shockingly hardy plant, it became quite well known and was even included as a landmark on European military maps of the otherwise desolate expanse during the 1930s. When Michel Lesourd of the Central Service of Saharan Affairs first came upon the tree in 1939, he wrote: “One must see the Tree to believe its existence. What is its secret? How can it still be living in spite of the multitudes of camels which trample at its sides? How at each azalai does not a lost camel eat its leaves and thorns? Why don’t the numerous Touareg leading the salt caravans cut its branches to make fires to brew their tea? The only answer is that the tree is taboo and considered as such by the caravaniers. There is a kind of superstition, a tribal order which is always respected. Each year the azalai gather round the Tree before facing the crossing of the Ténéré. The Acacia has become a living lighthouse; it is the first or the last landmark for the azalai leaving Agadez for Bilma, or returning.” When a nearby well was dug finally dug, the secret to the miraculous tree’s survival was finally discovered. While the surface of the desert was a wasteland, the Ténéré tree’s roots reached over a hundred feet underground into the water table. But not even its incredible roots could save it from its eventual demise. For most of its modern life, the tree was the only structure around for 250 miles in any direction, yet despite this, in 1973, a reportedly inebriated truck driver mowed down the acacia. The remains of the tree were relocated to the Niger National Museum in Niamey, and a lonely metal sculpture was put in the tree’s place to commemorate it."

Due to the remote resting place of the wreck, the wreckage is still scattered around the area, a glaring but out-of-sight reminder of the tragedy that happened there. After 18 years of it being nothing but a desert filled with debris, the families of the victims came together and decided to build a monument in one of the most remote places on the globe. Funded with the 170-million-dollar aid package provided by the Libyan government, trucks were driven almost 44 miles out to transport countless stones to place at the crash site. After two months of grueling work in a brutal climate, the monument was complete. The stones when seen from above resemble a compass with a plane inside it. Around the edge of the monument are 170 broken mirrors, each mirror symbolizing a victim in the crash. At one end of the monument, one of the plane’s wings stands with its tip pointing up, with a plaque that lists the names of the victims."

According to the Yoruba folklore, the deity or Orisa of fertility is called Osun. Osun had a fight with one of the wives of Sango and changed herself into the Osun River. The grove is considered sacred since the deity is still believed to live within the river. The grove was discovered by an elephant hunter during an expedition. An agreement was made between the goddess and the people that Osun would protect the people if they built a shrine for her and protect the grove. Devotees brought offerings to the goddess and women came for blessings if they were barren. An Austrian woman by the name of Susan Wenger and several other artists saved the grove from demolition by erecting huge sculptures made of iron and mud. She married a local drummer and lived in Osun Oshogbo until her death. The Osun-Osogbo Grove was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.  On the banks of the Osun River in a little village. The entry fee is $3. If you bring in a camera, there is an additional camera fee of $10. It is recommended to get a guide so you can fully understand the significance and history (negotiate with them before, pay roughly $2). Be aware that there are often cleansing rituals in the river and therefore no photographs when that is going on."
46,Iyake Suspended Lake,"Ado Awaiye, Nigeria",Ado Awaye Mountain and the unique lake that sits near its peak are shrouded in ancient legends.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iyake-suspended-lake,"Ado-Awaye is an ancient site with no shortage of timeless wonder. Founded in 1500, the neighboring mountain communities Ado and Awaye were amalgamated over centuries into the single Ado-Awaye, once ruled over by the King of Ado, a disgraced crown prince from the larger Oyo kingdom. Hiking the Ado Awaye mountain takes roughly three hours depending on speed. Most of the terrain shifts between rock and forest, beginning with rough steps carved into the mountain. En route to the top, travelers encounter numerous ancient sites. Oke Ishage, or Ishage Rock, is said to be the bringer of rain for Ado-Awaye. When rain is needed, a priest will visit the boulder-like rock and cover its bottom half with a white cloth to usher in rain. Some believe that those touching the rock while making a wish will see their wishes granted. On the way up the mountain, hikers come across the Esè àwon Àgbà, Yoruba for “footprints of the gods.” Historians theorize these small footprint-sized holes were used for grinding stones several centuries ago, but mythology deems them evidence of walking deities. Hikers who reach the mountain apex are rewarded by a view of Iyake lake, one of only two suspended lakes—defined as a lake on top of a mountain—in the world. Legend says that beneath Iyake lies another world, a parallel existence ruled over by a goddess of fertility who lives inside the lake. The exact depth of Iyake is unknown, and legend says that none who enter the lake ever return. It’s rumored that if one puts their foot in the hole near the lake known as Agbómofúnyàké (Yoruba for “collects child and gives to iyake”) when it’s filled with water, the person will be dragged to the bottom. Not all mythology surrounding the lake is sinister though; it is said the lake’s water can cure ailments and disease when used to bathe.  Hiring a guide for the hike is highly recommended. Atabo David is known as the premier English-speaking guide and charges 1,000 Naira ($1.75 per adult and 200 ($0.35) Naira* per child. The entry fee for the mountain is 500 Naira ($0.87). Visitors should plan to take a car from Ibadan or Abeokuta (both accessible by train from Lagos via the Ibadan-Lagos Railway, which charges fare based on your stop). Atabo David can recommend one of two motels for overnight guests, which charge between 3,000 and 5,000 Naira ($5.26 - $8.79) per room per night. No climbing accessories are required for the hike except for good shoes (closed toe, in case of snakes). Bring cash or plan to use a Nigerian bank card, as international card readers almost certainly won’t be available. *Calculations using black market exchange rate of ~570 N / $1.00. Official rate is 410 N / $1.00, but continued inflation and devaluation of the Naira keep the black market rate fluctuating between 570 - 610 N / $1.00 as of November 10, 2021."

The cave, which formed as a result of a massive outcrop of granite rock, is a sight to behold. Water cascades down from the top to form a stream at its base with white sand along its shores. The cave itself stands at 30 meters (98 feet) high. The water flowing down the waterfall remains warm throughout the seasons. Awhum’s waterfall is believed to have healing powers and the ability to ward off evil spirits. Because of this, a monastery was built close to the waterfall site. This has made the waterfall cave a pilgrimage and a prayer center for Christians, the site is sacred and therefore entry to the site is regulated by the monastery. Awhum (sometimes spelled “Ohum”), is located in a lush green valley in Nigeria’s Enugu State. It is famous not only for its waterfall, but also for its many pristine lakes and streams."

During the rainy season, the rushing falls create a thunderous sound and sometimes, for those who are lucky enough to see them, rainbows. Agbokim waterfall is situated in Etung local government area of Cross River State, about 17 kilometers (10 miles) from the small town of Ikom. Agbokim waterfall is most significant for its multiple adjoining streams, which tumble down to form a mesmerizing cascade of water that flows down to a beautiful pool. The waterfall is surrounded by steep hills and valleys, which makes the hike to the waterfall challenging, yet rewarding. Agbokim waterfall was discovered in the 1900s by a hunter who later moved his family close to the waterfall. Over time, a community grew in the surrounding area. The waterfall offers a beautiful and serene environment for nature lovers and lovers seeking a getaway spot as it offers exclusivity and tranquility. Because of its remote location, Agbokim waterfall is not a highly-visited site in Nigeria, although the area has seen an increase in tourism in the last decade.

She and her husband, a contractor named Jammal, married in the 1980s and were living in Nigeria. Willing to promise the world for her love, Jammal agreed to one day build a plane-shaped home for her as a symbol of their love and her love of travel. For years, the promise remained unfulfilled, until the in the early 1999, the Said family found the perfect location for their dream home. Construction began in 2002, with Jammal overseeing every step of the process. Wanting to make everything perfect for his wife, Jammal began work on a 100-foot long plane with a wingspan of 50 feet extending over the sides of the hilltop villa. Spanning the entire roof, the body of the plane features a kitchen and a computer room inside the cockpit that looks out over Abuja. Along with the main villa, the property features a number of other aircraft-styled structures.

The natural monolith is located in the western part of Nigeria, near the capital city of Abuja. The rock was found in the 15th century by the Zuba people of Niger State, who called it zumwa, which could translate to “a place of guinea fowls,” due to their abundance around the rock. The Zuba people settled around the rock and came to see it as a spiritual guide, making sacrifices to the rock to keep them safe from harm. Because the landmark offered a clear view of the surrounding landscape, it was also used as a defensive position from other invading tribes. Zuma Rock is composed of igneous rock, specifically gabbro and granodiorite. The natural runoff of water has left the rock surface with a human-like facial feature imprinted on the rock, with features like, mouth, nose, and eyes. The rock tends to get alight with fire during the rainy season. Friction created moving rocks caused by the sliding slope of the rock and during this, the fire comes up. It has become one of the most prominent landmarks in Nigeria, and since 1999 has been printed on the country’s 100 naira notes. Hiking up to the top of the rock takes about five hours.  Freely accessible."
51,Prayer Mountain Hanwa,"Zaria, Nigeria",This collection of Christian churches are nestled in the cracks of a rocky hill in Northern Nigeria.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prayer-mountain-hanwa,"Nigeria is separated by the Christian South and Muslim North. The political structure of the north consists of seven influential Muslim Emirs and other religious leaders working in parallel with the government. Zaria, a large town in Kaduna state, is the seat of one of the seven Emirs. However, it also hosts a substantial migrant community from the south. This community is predominantly Christian, speak a different language, and face political and economic marginalization. Without the land and funds to construct major churches, Zaria’s Christian community designed several hidden places of worship on the outskirts of town. Many are located along a rocky crag known as Prayer Mountain Hanwa. From the top of the hill, a surprisingly diverse collection of religious spaces reveal themselves. These range from established brick churches and simple metal shacks, to caves spray-painted with crosses. Worshipers can be seen climbing the hill at any time of day. On a Sunday, the hill and community at its base reverberate religious music that creates a surreal feeling of being transported to the south of the country. The worshipers are very welcoming to the few out-of-town visitors who make it to this little-known region. They are more than happy to show visitors the magic they’ve created on this rocky hill.  The location listed for ""Prayer Mountain Hanwa"" on Google Maps is correct. If coming from the main Kaduna-Kano road, turn right just before the Conoil Petrol Pump and the mountain will be clearly visible. Ask locals to point you to one of the many paths up. Come on a Sunday to experience the most activity and music. Finally, all travelers must be conscious of the current security situation in the Zaria area and Kaduna state as a whole before making this trip."
52,Esie Figurines,"Esie, Nigeria","More than 1,000 stone figures were discovered in a small Nigerian town, where they had been sitting for centuries.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/esie-figurines,"Esie is a small town in Nigeria’s Kwara state that lies in the south-central part of the country. It is most famous for being home to the largest collection of stone carvings in Africa. These stone carvings were first discovered by a hunter in 1775. The true origins of the Esie figurines remain unknown, though many theories have been put forward to explain them. The figurines are made from steatite stone, also known as soapstone. When they were found, the figurines were in a circular arrangement. They depict men, women, children, and animals in sitting or kneeling positions. Some are holding onto agricultural tools or musical instruments. The figurines vary in height, and each weighs between 0.55 to 140 kilograms. It is estimated that the pieces were carved sometime between the 12th and 15th centuries. Some scholars believe that the figurines are associated with an ancient Yoruba kingdom located nearby. One popular explanation for the carvings says that the figurines were once a community of people who were cursed by the gods and turned into stone. The Esie figurines first gained public attention in 1933, thanks to the effort of H.G Ramshaw, a missionary in Nigeria. In 1945, a museum was built near the site where the figurines were found (it was the first official museum established in Nigeria). More recent excavation at the site has revealed more figurines are still buried. Current estimates put the total at about 1,000 to 1,500 figurines. Figures from Esie can also be found at the Nigerian National Museum in Lagos and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York."
53,Gidan Rumfa (Emir's Palace),"Kano, Nigeria",Walk through history in a palace that has seen centuries of Muslim rulers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gidan-rumfa-emirs-palace,"Constructed in the 15th century, the Emir’s palace in Kano is the longest continued seat of power for a ruling authority in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the Hausa language, the palace is known as Gidan Rumfa after the Sultan Muhammad Rumfa, under whom the palace was constructed, or Gidan Sarki, which translates as “Emir’s house.” The campus now spans 33 acres; It is a centerpiece of Kano city and is considered one of the best-preserved examples of traditional Hausa architecture in Nigeria. In traditional Hausa architecture, compound family homes are thought of as a microcosm of a city or town, complete with walls, an entrance gate, and multiple living spaces designed around an open courtyard. Elaborately carved pinnacles outside the home, called Zankwaye, historically signify prestige and social status. Although parts of the palace were rebuilt in the early 19th century when the Sokoto caliphate defeated the Hausa kingdom in war, there are still original Zankwaye on display more than 500 years after Gidan Rumfa’s original construction. Today, its living quarters are home to the current Emir Aminu Ado Bayero II, and the full compound contains several schools, living spaces, offices, gardens, and mosques. Visitors are best served when aligning their trips to Gidan Rumfa with Kano’s famed Durbar festival, a four-day celebration held after Eid al-Fitr at the close of Ramadan and Eid al-Adha, at the end of the annual Hajj pilgrimage. The festival has contested origins, combining the importance of a pre-colonial horsemanship culture with a spectacle contrived by the British colonial governors meant to reinforce feelings of loyalty and patriotism with the indirect rule perpetuated by imperialism. The equine focus of the festivities dates back to the 14th century, with each day celebrated with an elaborate horse ride to different quarters of the city by the Emir and his entourage. The second day of the Durbar festivities features the Jahi, a break-neck cavalry salute to the Emir by his horsemen in a scene that draws thousands of spectators due to its dramatic charging of horses. The Jahi takes place outside the gates of the Gidan Rumfa, and can be traced back to the Sultan Muhammad Rumfa.  Visiting Gidan Rumfa during Ramadan isn’t recommended unless you will be participating in prayer, as regular visiting hours are restricted due to religious gatherings. The palace is open to visitors from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays. A pass from the Emirate council is required to enter the palace for a guided tour and can be obtained ahead of time, but tourists are generally able to walk the grounds without formal permission from the council. Women are recommended to wear a hijab or scarf covering their head and either a long skirt and sleeves or traditional kaftan. Men are recommended to wear long sleeves and pants or a traditional kaftan. There are sections of the Gidan Rumfa that are gender-segregated, and some that do not permit women to enter."
54,Kenneth Dike Library,"Ibadan, Nigeria","Not only does this library house unique Arabic manuscripts, but it was also designed to keep the building cool during warm days.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kenneth-dike-library,"In 1948, this magnificent library was constructed as part of the University of Ibadan. Named after professor Kenneth Dike, the first indigenous Principal, and former Vice-Chancellor, the design is heralded as an amazing example of  “tropical modernism.” The library was created by Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, two artists that pioneered the Modern Movement in England. The library is covered in patterned sunscreens, a popular architectural feature at the time. These panels keep the building cool during hot days as the screens deflect sunlight. While the architecture of the building has been recognized for its uniqueness, it’s what’s inside that truly makes this library a gem of Nigeria. Amid the library’s collection are around two million books, journals, and other academic resources. These include ancient Arabic manuscripts and text, along with documents from the country’s colonial period. The entire library contains around 3,000,000 volumes and seats 1,550 readers. There are also multiple branches of the library that can be found both on and off-campus."
55,Nike Centre for Art and Culture,"Lekki, Nigeria","Not your average art gallery, this massive center hosts 8,000 works from artists across Africa—and it’s free to the public.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nike-centre-for-art-and-culture,"You haven’t been overwhelmed by art until you’ve entered the Nike Art Center, a whopping five stories jam-packed with around 8,000 different pieces of artwork. The massive building, said to be the largest gallery in West Africa, is open to the public for free and regularly features a diverse legion of up-and-coming African artists alongside household names. The center was founded by Nike Davies-Okundaye, who grew up steeped in her family’s culture of textile making, dyeing, weaving, and painting. She’s credited with teaching thousands of young Nigerian artists over the last 40 years, as well as providing exhibition space for showing works. Located outside of Lagos proper in the suburb of Lekki, the Nike Art Gallery is akin to a maze once you leave the first floor, which beyond sculpture and paintings includes a visitor’s desk and several couches arranged for guests’ comfort, with wine on offer. The next four floors are covered nearly floor-to-ceiling in canvases of all sizes, interspersed with sculptures, beading work, and textile art. Visitors won’t find a section where a single artist is featured solo, rather works are spread across the gallery no matter the prominence of the artist—Davis-Okundaye included. The higher you ascend, the less the air conditioning reaches, so be warned as you access the top rooms, which can be especially stuffy when electricity is down. Photography is only allowed with visitors in the frame, so don’t snap pictures of the artwork by itself. Tour guides are highly recommended to learn about the art on display, and generally operate on a tip basis. Group tours, however, are priced depending on size. Unlike many museums, all the artwork you see is for sale at price points that range from a few hundred dollars to more than $20,000. A shop on the gallery property also offers handmade jewelry, bags, textiles, clothing, and accessories. Dancers are often present onsite and perform traditional Yoruba dances for visitors. Lucky visitors may even get a chance to meet personally with Davies-Okundaye, who works out of the gallery.  Put aside at least two hours to visit the gallery for a full experience. Art buyers have historically had difficulty with international credit card purchases, but PayPal has worked, and cash is accepted. The gallery is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day except Sunday, when hours are 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. There are no elevators, so the gallery is not wheelchair accessible beyond the first floor."
56,Makoko Floating School,"Lagos, Nigeria",The innovative Nigerian floating school that may just be a glimpse into the future of design in a world of troubling climate changes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/makoko-floating-school,"Every school day, close to 100 Nigerian children from the coastal city of Lagos head off in boats to a most unusual schoolhouse on the water. The 3-storey, A-frame structure bobs on the waves of the lagoon that lines the waterfront slum of Makoko. A severely overcrowded water community that already hosts a stilted fishing village with a population in the tens of thousands, Makoko was an ideal location to test out this eco-friendly architectural model. Designed by NLE Architects, the  Makoko Floating School is part of a “pilot project” that will unfold in a total of three phases, the school’s completion in 2014 marking the completion of phase one. The project is an attempt to tackle both Makoko’s specific needs and the urgency to provide sustainable living solutions as climate change continues to directly affect coastal communities at large. The goal? To create alternative, green building systems that can support rapid urbanization and adapt to climate-induced issues that could affect infrastructure. Already nominated for the Designs of the Year 2014 by the Design Museum in London, Nigerian architect Kunlé Adeyemi’s floating school seems like a very promising option. The A-frame structure sits atop 256 recycled plastic barrels, and is made mostly of wood and local materials. Its triangular shape allows for several levels, its low center of gravity providing stability even in high winds. The classroom is located on the 2nd tier, the roof providing an open air environment, and uses PV cells on the roof and a rainwater system to boost sustainability. The lower level is used as a playground while school is in session, and when school gets out for the day, it becomes a community space for village residents to fish and relax in the cool shade the naturally ventilated structure provides.Ideally, if “phase one’ shows itself to be a viable living option, communities like those in Lagos that are plagued by increasingly devastating floods and increased rainfall shouldl be able to retreat to the waters. The final stages of the project involve creating other community serving buildings and lashing them together-one beautiful, eco-friendly floating city on the ever-expanding waters of the Makoko lagoon. Update: The Makoko Floating School collapsed in 2016."
57,Lake Tele,"Epena, Republic of the Congo",This picturesque round lake is said to be home to the legendary Mokèlé-mbèmbé.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-tele,"Located amidst one of the least explored areas in the world, Lake Tele is rumored to be home to the Mokèlé-mbèmbé, a Brontosaurus-like creature that is the Congo’s answer to the Loch Ness Monster. Due to the dense tropical swampland surrounding the lake, the area is extremely hard to survey. Dangerous animals/insects and impassible terrain are just some of the obstacles explorers of the area face. However, there is rumored to be a secretive beast lurking in the dense swamp. For hundreds of years, reports of a mysterious cryptid resembling a long-necked dinosaur have trickled out of the area, being briefly spotted by explorers or described by the native pygmies, and it is widely believed to live in Lake Tele. Of course, there has been no verifiable evidence of the beast, but the reports are so widespread and exist over such a long period of time that the creature has grabbed the imagination of cryptozoologists across the globe. They believe that Mokèlé-mbèmbé is a prehistoric survivor of some sort, who hides in Lake Tele and the unnavigable swamps surrounding it. There is even tell of some local pygmies who once killed and ate a Mokèlé-mbèmbé. While it’s unlikely that the Mokèlé-mbèmbé exists in the stagnant, landlocked waters of Lake Tele, it has  certainly made its home in the minds of believers everywhere."
58,De Brazza's Mausoleum,"Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo",A crypt believed by many Congolese to be a center of black magic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/de-brazza-s-mausoleum,"On October 2, 2006, a charter plane carrying the skeletal remains of the 19th-century Italian explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, as well as those of his wife and four children, took off from Algeria and landed at Maya-Maya airport in Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of Congo. De Brazza’s bones were met at the airport by three African presidents, who escorted them to their new resting place, a $10 million marble and glass mausoleum built at a major intersection in downtown Brazzaville, the city that De Brazza helped found. Many Congolese have refused to enter the mausoleum. At first, the rejection was merely a protest against the heroic veneration of a colonialist. But soon, ominous rumors started to circulate about the memorial. Talk to anyone on the street in downtown Brazzaville, and you will hear the same thing: the mausoleum is a center of kindoki, or “black magic.” Indeed, in a country where politics is often intertwined with traditional beliefs about sorcery, the building is believed to be a kind of Skull and Bones of Equatorial Africa, a place where a shadowy African elite meets to plot the future of the continent. Anyone who enters risks coming under the spell of powerful leaders—and may not emerge alive. Hence the empty building at the heart of the city.  This building is actually located on Avenue Amilcar Cabral which is one block closer to the river."
59,Nabemba Tower,"Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo",The tallest building in the Republic of the Congo is a source of pride despite its towering maintenance costs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nabemba-tower,"The Nabemba Tower rises up from the banks of the Congo River in the Congolese capital of Brazzaville. Built in the 1980s, the office skyscraper is the tallest building in the Republic of the Congo and one of the tallest in Central Africa. Back in the 1980s, the Marxist government of the Republic of the Congo set out a five-year plan to redevelop the capital of Brazzaville. Bragging rights were at stake, particularly with neighboring Kinshasa, the more famous capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo located just across the river (despite the similarity in names, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly known as Zaire, is a different country). Despite the general poverty of its populace, the oil-rich nation began to invest in modern structures rather than much-needed infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and roads. The centerpiece of this period of development was the Nabemba Tower, built between 1982 and 1986. Designed by Jean Marie Legrand and built with oil money lent by the French oil company Elf Aquitaine (hence the building’s other name, the Elf Tower), the completed building consisted of 30 stories at a total height of 348 feet (106 meters). It became the tallest building in the Republic of the Congo, a title it still holds today and was named after Mont Nabemba, the highest mountain in the country. The design of the building has garnered both praise and criticism in terms of its aesthetics. The bulk of the tower is a concave cylinder of alternate vertical strips of glass and white concrete, which accentuate the curvature of the structure. This sits on top of a rectangular pedestal, making the whole thing look somewhat precarious. For some, it’s one of the modern architectural marvels of Central Africa. For others, it’s one of the ugliest skyscrapers in the world. Since its construction, the Nabemba Tower has been the focus of issues far more important than its simple artistic merits. In 1997, civil war tore its way through Brazzaville and the tower was riddled by gunfire and almost reduced to ruins. It was all but abandoned until 2001 when it was rebuilt and reopened at enormous cost. The total reconstruction effort cost more than $7.5 million, significantly more than it cost to build in the first place. And then there are the ongoing maintenance costs, which for a relatively poor country are unsurprisingly controversial. Granted, the building houses the offices of some well-meaning groups including the African Self-Help Development Initiative, the New Partnership for African Development, and UNESCO. But with its annual running costs of around $3.8 million, it’s not hard to see why some critics see the Nabemba Tower as a costly folly, especially in a country with failing health, education and transport systems. Despite much local pride in the towering structure, many people agree with local architect Norbert Mbila, who described the Nabemba Tower as “a strategic building that was built for prestige. It is neither appropriate nor efficient, and it requires a great deal of maintenance.”  Nabemba Tower is located along Avenue Amilcar Cabral near the banks of the Congo River in the south of Brazzaville. It's an office building and not really set up for tourism, so you might have to charm the receptionist at the ground floor desk if you want to poke around inside."
60,Trou de Fer (The Iron Hole),Réunion,At the center of an island in the middle of the Indian Ocean is a deep chasm ringed by tall waterfalls.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trou-de-fer,"Réunion is an island in the Indian Ocean, sandwiched between Madagascar and Mauritius, a thousand miles from the east coast of Africa. Despite its remote location, as a “department” of France it’s actually part of the Eurozone, and with nearly a million inhabitants and some of the lushest and most magical landscapes in the world, the volcanic outpost has a robust tourist industry. Tourism in the area centers around the coastal regions of Réunion, but at the island’s center is one of its most extraordinary sites, a canyon that reaches nearly a quarter mile (300 meters) into the Earth, ringed by a chorus of six tall waterfalls. Trou de Fer (the “Iron Hole”) is a collapsed crater of an ancient volcano, fed by bubbling rivers and streams, but dangerous to descend. So rugged is the terrain at Trou de Fer, and so rain-soaked most of the year, the deep chasm wasn’t fully explored until 1989. Not that climbers hadn’t tried to reach its depths—they just never made it back out. Today it is a relatively easy hike to get there, just a couple of miles of well-groomed trails with a viewing platform at the end. From the high vantage point, you can see the surrounding mountains, tropical forests, and all the waterfalls that make their way to the bottom. The island of Réunion is off the east coast of Africa, about 450 miles (730 km) east of Madagascar. To see Trou de Fer, there is a sturdy lookout platform over the falls and canyon, a relatively easy 2-mile (3.5 km) hike from Gîte de Bélouve."
61,Piton des Neiges,"Salazie, Réunion",Réunion Island's highest point is a 2 million-year-old volcano and a paraglider's paradise.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/piton-des-neiges,"As you make your way through the unique landscape of Piton des Neiges, there is something about the harsh and dramatic terrain that feels acutely prehistoric. This ancient volcano, located in the north-central region of France’s Réunion Island, formed around two million years ago—a million years after the formation of the island itself—and has now been dormant for more than 20,000 years. At 3,069 meters (10,069 feet), the Piton des Neiges is not only Réunion’s most prominent geological feature, but also considered the highest peak in the Indian Ocean. Piton des Neiges translates to “Snow Peak,” though you won’t be seeing any snow atop this dark, hulking, and slowly eroding volcano except for a rare dusting. Réunion, which is an overseas region and department of France (and thus a far-flung piece of the Eurozone), is part of the Mascarene Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. The island has only been home to humans since the 17th century, and due to its remote location, has a unique biological makeup; on the lower slopes of the Piton des Neiges, you’ll find a biological reserve. The entire volcano belongs to the island’s national park, and more adventurous visitors even use the Piton’s peak as a launch point for paragliding flights. The elderly volcano enjoys the close companionship of the Piton de la Fournaise (“Peak of the Furnace”), which unlike Piton des Neiges, is highly active and has erupted more than 150 times in the last few centuries. The volcano is surrounded by the Cirques (Cirque de Mafat, Cirque de Salazie, and Cirque de Cilaos), three enormous crater valleys that offer starting points for hikes up to the island’s highest point. Hikers will often start their long trek to the island’s ultimate vantage point while it is still dark out in order to catch the sunrise over Réunion as fluffy clouds meander through the jagged valleys and ridge lines below. Cumulous clouds form often and quickly up in the region’s higher elevations, generally shrouding the upper peaks by late morning.  May through November is the best hiking weather. The hike to the top of the volcano is moderate but not technical, and there are many other trails in the area. For a two-day hike, you can make reservations at the Refuge de la Caverne Dufour, a staffed mountain hut about 600m (in altitude) below the summit, and then tackle the peak in the early morning. If you start from Cilaos, you can reach the top of the Piton with a shorter, round-trip day hike. You'll mostly likely need a car to access the trailheads, which are luckily well marked."
62,Notre Dame des Laves,"Piton Sainte-Rose, Réunion",At the foot of an active volcano sits a church miraculously spared by its lava.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/notre-dame-des-laves,"The inhabitants of France’s Réunion island are no strangers to volcanic activity. Since the 17th century, the island has seen more than a hundred eruptions from one volcano alone, the picturesque Piton De La Fournaise. So when the mountain rumbled in 1977, residents of the nearby village of Piton Sainte-Rose were prepared. What came as a surprise, however, was that the flow of lava, which sped down the mountain’s slopes into the Indian Ocean, parted miraculously at the doors of a local church. Or so the legend goes. According to a less poetic (but more accurate) account, the lava made its way inside and wreaked havoc to the building’s contents. Though it’s something of a miracle nonetheless that the church’s walls remained standing, considering the terrain around it was swept clean away, destroying many of the village’s crops and homes. Today, the church’s name, which translates to “Our Lady of the Lava,” and a set of stained glass windows depicting the eruption serve as a reminder to the narrow escape. As for the volcanic rocks, many were removed in the post-eruption cleanup, but replaced later to provide a recreation of the scene after the 1977 event. Painted in cheery pastels, the church stands out starkly against the sea of black lava, like a creation straight out of Wes Anderson’s mind. The Piton de la Fournaise volcano continues its regular eruptions (it’s active even as this article is being written), but wherever the lava flows, the photogenic miracle of Notre Dame des Laves will take some beating.  Our Lady of the Lava is easily accessible by car. It stands on the side of the major N2 road, and it is impossible to miss."
63,Formica Léo,"Sainte Rose, Réunion","On one of the world's most active volcanoes, a pebble-filled crater changes color with the wind.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/formica-leo,"In the middle of the basalt plain surrounding one of the most active volcanoes in the world, the Piton de la Fournaise (literally “peak of the furnace”), there is an exceptional rocky formation. The Formica Léo is made out of millions of small basalt pebbles of different tints, from glossy black to rocky red. Its color tends to change as the pebbles shift under the strong winds or the visitor’s feet. Formica Léo was named for its appearance, which is similar to an antlion’s sand pit trap. The geological formation is made up of two overlapping craters: the crater to the southeast is larger and deeper, measuring 40 meters (131) in diameter and 15 meters (50 feet) deep, while the northwest crater is smaller and shallower at 22 meters  (72 feet) in diameter and five meters (16 feet) deep. The earliest records of Formica Léo dates back to the 18th century. According to one report, a bounty hunter in Réunion claimed to have directly witnessed its formation during an eruption of Piton de la Fournaise in the 1750s. The first person known to have approached the crater was Joseph Hubert, who gave the structure its insect-inspired name during a crossing of the Enclos Fouqué caldera in 1768. Several decades later, in 1801, French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent wrote the first general scientific description of the Piton de la Fournaise after climbing to the top of the volcano. It is still not certain how it was formed, even though the numerous volcanologists of the island have a lot of theories.  The Formica Leo is on the way to the volcano on the hike from the Pas de Bellecombe. It's hard to miss, really."

The trail is well-marked and easy to navigate. Along the way you’ll pass through banana and coffee plants, meet locals selling snacks and drinks to keep you pedaling, and children who want to practice some English as you ride by.  If you need to rent a bike and/or are looking for guides, we had great success with Rwandan Adventures in south Gisenyi."
65,Kuruhimbi Milk Bar,"Kigali, Rwanda",One of the capital's last independent milk bars remains a crucial community watering hole.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kuruhimbi-milk-bar,"Kuruhimbi is one of Kigali’s most popular bars, and it doesn’t serve a drop of liquor. Instead, milk is on tap. Located in the city’s Kimisagara neighborhood, on a dirt road just a few minutes away from a bustling market, Kuruhimbi is a milk bar and Rwandan stalwart. Despite its popularity, Kuruhimbi is one of the last of its kind: With the growth of Inyange Milk Zone, a corporate milk bar chain, local milk bars are becoming relics of the country’s past. Kuruhimbi may not be the easiest place to find—it’s not listed on Google maps, and there’s no website or official phone number—but the colorful sign above the entrance, crisp white interiors, and patterned red-and-yellow plastic tablecloths are nothing if not welcoming. Once you’re inside, the menu is fairly self-explanatory. Poured from a vast metal drum in the corner of the shop, frothy cups of milk are served hot or cold alongside snacks such as chapati, samosas, and hard-boiled eggs. Ikivuguto, a thick fermented milk similar to probiotic yogurt, is one of Kuruhimbi’s specialties, and locals swear the bar brews the best in the city. Condiments—honey, sugar, and cocoa powder—are readily available. The bar seats no more than 10 at a time, but customers pop in and out quickly, just long enough to throw back a half liter of milk or fill up a large jerry can for takeaway. Kuruhimbi is one of the community watering holes, and many nearby residents spend late mornings and afternoons chatting in the shop. The owners often buzz around as well, restocking snacks behind the counter or filling up glasses. They have lived in the neighborhood for decades, and they source Kuruhimbi’s milk from farms just outside of Kigali’s city limits. Although Kuruhimbi is one of many similar operations scattered throughout the area, milk bars are unique to Rwanda. Cows are intrinsic to Rwandan culture and heritage, and the advent of milk bars came with the advent of the modern Rwandan city, rendering Kigali the country’s de facto milk bar capital. When citizens left their rural homes and cows behind for urban life, the milk bar was born as a way to keep Rwandans connected to their dairy. Cows often signify prosperity and are involved in many of Rwanda’s rituals, including traditional marriage ceremonies. The independent Kigali milk bar, once ubiquitous, is slowly being replaced by dozens of Inyange Milk Zones, a sterile, government-owned chain replica. Though colorful signs still dot the city, replete with images of cows and the words Amata Meza (“fresh milk”), Kuruhimbi is one of just a few operational neighborhood milk bars still standing.  Kuruhimbi is located at KN 204 St. 14. It can be a little tricky to find, but once you make it to the main road, friendly residents will point you in the right direction. The bar is cash only and the hours are inconsistent. Typically, they're open every day from 6:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., though that is dependent on how many customers are in the bar at any given time."
66,Dian Fossey's Grave,"Musanze, Rwanda",Burial site of the world's most widely known researcher on the endangered mountain gorilla.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dian-fossey-s-grave,"Found murdered in the bedroom of her cabin in the Virunga Mountains of Rwanda in 1985, Dian Fossey was - and remains - the most widely-known researcher on the endangered mountain gorilla, of which only about 250 are believed to still live in the wild. The last entry in Fossey’s diary, which was found in her cabin, read: “When you realize the value of all life, you dwell less on what is past and concentrate on the preservation of the future.” Fossey’s skull had been split open with a machete, a tool used by poachers in the area to hunt and kill the gorilla for resale. It is assumed that the poachers of the area, which Fossey had fought hard for nearly a decade, had her killed to make their lives easier. Thousands of dollars in cash, checks, and other valuables were found untouched in the cabin. Today, Fossey is buried next to her dead gorilla friends, many of which had been killed by the very poachers that likely hunted her. After her death, memorial services were held in Washington D.C., New York, and California. The cabins in which she and her staff lived do not exist anymore except for a few bare foundations, overgrown with weeds. This is a difficult hike, steep at places, that will take about five hours. Wear gloves and cover up to protect yourself from the stinging flora. All tourist groups are accompanied by armed guards to protect against poachers and wild animals."
67,Kakira Imigongo Cooperative,Rwanda,A small Rwandan workshop where you'll find traditional works of art—made from cow dung.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kakira-imigongo-cooperative,"In Rwanda, cattle are an important status symbol, and if you venture into the rural areas of the country you’re almost guaranteed to cross paths with these gloriously long-horned denizens. You may even find yourself scraping their dung off your shoes. Or if you’re lucky, hanging it on your living room wall. For generations, cow dung has been to create a striking and truly unique art form found only in Rwanda, called imigongo. Despite the rather unconventional medium, the characteristic colorful geometric patterns of traditional imigongo paintings would fit right in with most modern decor. Legend has it that in the 18th century, Prince Kakira was the first to use the ordure of these revered animals to decorate the interior walls of his house, mixed with ash and clay for color. The new art form took the name of the prince’s domain, Gisaka-Imigongo. Today’s imigongo artwork has mostly migrated off walls, and is generally painted on portable wooden panels, plates, or wall hangings, which are popular with tourists. The vibrant paintings are composed of vibrant colors sourced from natural materials—mustard yellow, rusty red from the natural soil, white from kaolin or white clay, and black from the ashes of banana peels. This indigenous craft almost died out in the 1990s during the tragic Rwandan Genocide. But thankfully, there are a few cooperatives today in the Eastern Province keeping the art form alive, and indeed, thriving. The artists are mainly women, many made widows by the genocide To get to the heart of imigongo production, head to the town of Nyakarambi in the Kirehe district — about three and a half hours southeast of Kigali, the country’s capital, by bus. There are several options for visiting an imigongo workshop near town, the most well-known being the Kakira Imigongo Cooperative, named for the prince who originated the craft. Here you can watch women making imigongo and even step inside a dizzying hut decorated in traditional imigongo style. Continue down the road between Nyakarambi and Rusumo and you’ll see several other workshops along the way, and the main road through town is lined with charming planters decorated with imigongo art.  Kakira is located about 3 kilometers down the main road south of the Nyakarambi bus station. You can walk, hop a motorcycle taxi, or, if your bus is continuing on to Rusumo, convince your driver to let you descend a little past the official Nyakarambi stop. It is open most weekdays. If it appears closed, a neighbor may be able to help find one of the artists to open it for you. If you feel like taking your chances getting a work of imigongo through customs, you can purchase a traditional geometric or spiral pattern, or try some of the more recent zoological and cultural scenes."
68,Nyamunini Island,Rwanda,This breathtaking island on Rwanda’s Lake Kivu is a haven for thousands of fruit bats.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nyamunini-island,"Known jokingly as “Napoleon’s hat” for the similarities between its shape and Bonaparte’s unique headgear, Nyamunini Island has become a destination for Rwandese and foreigners alike. Hidden near the eastern shores of Lake Kivu on Rwanda’s shared border with Congo, Nyamunini is home to thousands of fruit bats. As many as 50,000 straw-colored fruit bats of the Eidolon helvum species have their home on the island, the largest colony of this kind in Rwanda. According to a biodiversity survey by the Rwanda Environment Management Authority, Nyamunini is the most biodiverse of the seven small islands found on Lake Kivu. This may be due in part to a dark past; the haven was set ablaze during the horrific 1994 genocide to kill dozens of fleeing Tutsis, and the subsequent lack of human settlements provided unencroached environmental conditions for plants and animals. For about $10, you can take a guided tour of Nyamunini and hike winding upward paths under a canopy of bats. When they fly as a group, the bats fill the sky in a truly spectacular vision that includes quite a bit of screeching. Staying on the paths mitigates the possibility of physical contact with bats, so visitors are not permitted to stray off the trail. The Rwanda Wildlife Conservation Association conducts monthly visits to Nyamunini to monitor the bats, and has recommended ecotourism guidelines for tours. The hike takes about 30 minutes depending on speed and stamina, and the island peak offers a striking panorama of Lake Kivu. Nyamunini is located in the Karongi district, also known as Kibuye, an area famed for its beauty and relaxation. For passport-toting visitors, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a short boat ride away, but tourists are recommended to cross the nearby land border instead. To reach Nyamunini, tourists can elect to rent a kayak or enter a small motorboat that can ferry them between the island and the mainland for between $15 and $30 (negotiations are up to you). Often, visitors will witness groups of cows swimming between Kivu’s islands, and can visit the neighboring islands to discover other wildlife and beautiful vistas.  There is no infrastructure on Nyamunini, so pack lunch and water for your trip. Most motorized boats have a small canopy, but Rwanda’s high altitude increases the sun’s strength, so bring a hat and sunscreen. Bring a light rain jacket if you’re visiting Rwanda in rainy season, which is heavy between late March and May, and light between September and December. Tours are available year round, but be sure to check on public holidays and during genocide commemoration (April 7 and the week following). Guides will expect a tip from foreign visitors, 2,000 RWF ($2) is average. Wear hiking shoes or sneakers, especially in rainy season. To book boats and tours, speak to the staff at your lodging. If you’re staying in an Air BnB or camping, call ahead to one of the lodging centers and book through them. Rwiza Village is a good place to start when looking to book. Tours are daytime only."
69,The Rock of Kamegeri,Rwanda,"After suggesting criminals be burned to death on this rock, a king's advisor suffered his own punishment.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-rock-of-kamegeri-rwanda,"There are several different versions of the story, but sources agree that an adviser to an early Rwandan king met a grisly end here, in a very unusual way. In the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century, a man named Kamegeri suggested to his king that this rock could be used to punish criminals, by heating it with firewood until it was red-hot, then strapping the person to the rock to bake to death. The king seemed pleased with the idea, and ordered it to be done. Once the rock was unbearably hot, the king surprised everyone by ordering not the criminal, but Kamegeri himself be burnt on the rock, to rid the kingdom of a man who would suggest such a cruel fate. According to one authentic report of the tale, the event took place during the reign of  Mwami (“King”) Yuhi IV Gahindiro, who ruled from 1746 to 1853 and had a reputation for being a fair and nonviolent ruler. Other reports have stated it was King Mibambwe Sekarongoro Mutabazi, who ruled much earlier. The Rock of Kamegeri, or “Urutare rwa Kamegeri” in the native language northeast historic film , still stands in the Ruhango district, and today tourists can visit the historical site where Kamegeri suffered his own cruel punishment. During your visit be sure to touch the rock, as locals say it is always warm no matter the weather. Getting there: Ask at the bus port in Ruhango or Nyanza for a route that will take you by the rock - it may take a couple tries to find someone who knows! In Kinyarwanda the rock is called: Urutare rwa Kamegeri. Most drivers will be happy to let you hop off by the rock. Heading from Ruhango towards Nyanza it is on the left, just near the side of the road. If you want to stop for photos and exploration, you'll need to flag down another bus to return or continue onward.Alternatively, you could grab a taxi from one of the bus ports, but be sure to discuss price first and make sure the driver knows where he is headed. At the rock: There is a guard nearby who will be annoyed if he thinks you are taking photos of his building, so make sure you make it clear that you are simply there to see the rock (photos of the rock should be free of charge) before you start snapping!"
70,Nyamirambo Women’s Center,"Kigali, Rwanda","This center in the Rwandan capital supports women’s livelihoods while educating visitors about traditional cooking, craft making, and more.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nyamirambo-womens-center,"In 2007, Rwanda’s parliament had the highest female representation in the world at 48.75 percent. But that equal representation wasn’t trickling down to women in Nyamirambo, one of the oldest neighborhoods in the capital city of Kigali. In response to the gender-based violence, discrimination, and gender inequality they were facing, 18 women came together to create the Nyamirambo Women Center (NWC), a community space with a mission of combating these prolific issues. Today, Rwanda retains its place at the top of global female parliamentary representation at 61.25 percent, and the NWC has evolved into a self-sustaining vocational and educational community center that supports more than 50 families. Women in Rwanda are known as umutima wa murugo, “the heart of the home,” and were essential to rebuilding the country in the aftermath of the Rwandan Civil War. After the horrific 1994 genocide, during which between 800,000 and more than one million people were slaughtered, women were estimated to make up around 70 percent of the population. The NWC follows that tradition of women-led solutions, evolving from a care center into a small business cooperative with the Umutima (heart) project, founded in 2013. The initiative supports vocational training in craft making and tailoring for women in the community. Clothing, home decor, and accessories are handmade out of kitenge fabric, banana leaves, sisal plant fiber, palm leaves, and more. In 2014, NWC founded a community library with books in Kinyarwanda, English, and French to encourage children’s literacy. The center also holds classes in English, reading, computer literacy, sewing, and weaving for adults. Umutima members can access workshops on mental health, women’s rights, and nutrition. For tourists, the NWC offers guided walking tours of Nyamirambo led by members of the Umutima cooperative. For $15 (plus an extra $3 for lunch), participants learn about the neighborhood, visit two mosques, tour a hair salon, and learn to pound cassava. Guests can also elect to take lessons in cooking or basket weaving, each for the same price. All profits go right back to running NWC and paying the wages of Umutima cooperative members.  Bring a light rain jacket if you’re visiting Rwanda in the rainy season, which is heavy between late March and May, and light between September and December. Nyamirambo is hilly, and some streets are cobblestone, so be sure to wear sneakers or walking shoes. Tours are offered year-round, but be sure to check on public holidays and during genocide commemoration (April 7 and the week following). If you want to book a tour or class, reach out to NWC via WhatsApp at +250 782 111 860, or via email at nwcoffice.kigali@gmail.com. The NWC center itself sells cooperative-made souvenirs, so bring some extra cash beyond what you’ll use for a tour/class."
71,Pico Cao Grande,"Caue, São Tomé and Príncipe",Nature’s skyscraper launches out of the terrain with attitude.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pico-cao-grande,"On a small island off the coast of Africa a lofty volcanic tower known as Pico Cao Grande looms dark on the horizon, like a fantasy landscape illustrating why mountains have often been mythologized as conduits between ancient divinities and earth. Standing at a whopping 386 meters tall, the “Great Dog Peak” is one of nature’s most impressive high-rises. The needle-shaped volcanic plug is made of treacherous volcanic rock and surrounded by a thick jungle of giant ferns infested with snakes which thrive in the humid climate. Despite these natural setbacks, the spire still manages to attract a couple of thrill-seeking climbers each year. Climbing the tower is especially dangerous due to the slippery mosses that cover much of the rock, not to mention the snakes that inhabit the needle itself. In addition, a blanket of mist usually cloaks the column resulting from Sao Tome’s abundance of annual rainfall (between 4,500 and 5,000 mm), making the surface as slippery as glass during actual precipitation.  Contact one of the many tour agencies such as Navetur. They speak perfect English and can help facilitate anything during your visit"
72,Roça Sundy,"Sundi, São Tomé and Príncipe",This nearly abandoned plantation was once witness to an eclipse that proved Einstein's theory of relativity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/roca-sundy,"Roça Sundy is a nearly abandoned coffee plantation on the small african island of Principe, just north of the equator where an independent astrophysicist proved Einstein’s theory of relativity by watching an eclipse. In 1919 famous British astrophysicist Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington traveled to the island of Príncipe to find the perfect location from which to view a predicted eclipse. Eddington hoped to capture starlight being shifted by the sun’s gravity, thus proving Einstein’s model of physics over Newton’s. The eclipse was necessary as it would be the only time he could view the light unobscured from the sun. He found the perfect spot in Roça Sundy. The Sundy plantation (roça translates to plantation) was a one time cocoa and coffee farm that had eventually turned over to the royal family of Principe who used the site as a vacation home. With a great deal of land close to the jungle, the ambient light was minimal and Eddington was able to set up shop in the main house. As he predicted, Eddington found slight curvature of the light and after publishing his findings, much of the scientific community deemed it the first concrete example of Einstein’s theory. Today the plantation site lies in great disrepair as though the jungle has decided to take over. People still live in the old slave’s quarters, while the master houses are locked. Old farming and processing equipment still litter the overgrown wilds of the plantation grounds, but there is precious little evidence of Eddington’s once groundbreaking research. There is a gate keeper and the plantation is more like a village where people live near (and in) the derelict buildings.  Take a plane to Lisbon, Portugal. From there take a plane to the Sao Tome island. The main of the two island that comprise Sao Tome and Principe. From Sao Tome, get a small plane to Principe. At Principe airport you need to negotiate with someone to drive you to Sundy. There are very few cars on the island and no taxi. You can also hop on a motorbike if you find someone that can take you."
73,Marco do Equador,"Ilhéu das Rolas, São Tomé and Príncipe",The equator passes through this tiny island in the eastern Atlantic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-equator-sao-tome,"Just south of São Tomé there is a small island called Ilhéu das Rolas. On this little island, you can find a monument marking the location of the equator. Ilhéu das Rolas covers just two square kilometers (0.77 square miles). It has a small population, and can only be reached by a ferry from the larger island of São Tomé Island, which lies across the Canal das Rolas. Between 1915 and 1918, Portuguese navigator and historian Gago Coutinho traveled to São Tomé on an expedition to map the island, which was at that point a colony of Portugal. During the mapping process, Coutinho observed that the equator crossed Ilhéu das Rolas. The monument marks the location were the equatorial line runs through the island, splitting it between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. It stands on the grounds of Ilhéu das Rolas’s only resort, the Pestana Equador. The ground underneath the monument is covered with a tile mosaic map of the world.  To get there you have to get a boat from Porto Alegre"
