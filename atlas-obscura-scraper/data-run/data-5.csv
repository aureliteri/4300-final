0,Lake Retba,"Rufisque, Senegal",This deceptively salty lake looks like blushing pink lemonade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-retba,"Evoking visions of Candyland fantasies, the princess pink waters of Lake Retba are deceptively inviting. White beaches and sandy dunes call to tourists, film crews, and even play host to the finish line of the Dakar Rally. As tempting as it appears, despite its popularity, and the fact that you will often see people wading through the pink waves, Lake Retba is not the friendliest of waters, and that white sand is mostly salt. Also known as “Lac Rose,” this unique lake lies just north of the Cap Vert Peninsula of Senegal, northeast of Dakar. Its salt content rivals that of the Dead Sea, which makes for increased human buoyancy, as well as a busy salt industry. Salt collectors arrive daily at the lake, covered in shea butter to protect their skin from the harsh salinity, and spend seven hours a day collecting the precious mineral from the lakebed. It is estimated that about 1,000 people work around the lake on a daily basis, and harvest some 24,000 tons of salt each year. Extracted salt is mostly used for fish preservation. The water in Lake Retba constantly changes hues, but the most stunning pink shade appears during the dry season, roughly from November to June. During windy weather and during the short wet season from July to October, the lake’s color is not strikingly pink due to the rain, which dilutes the salinity. The salt-loving micro-organism Dunaliella salina, combined with high mineral concentration and the intensity of the summer sun, are the producers of the cotton candy-colored water. With the salt levels reaching up to 40%, the lake can sometimes take a more sinister shade, appearing blood red, a much less comforting place for your imagination to go when gazing out upon the surreal view.  The lake is 40 km north of Senegal's capital, Dakar. With a car, the ride will take you less than one hour."
1,House of Slaves,"Dakar, Senegal",Despite a fraught and controversial history this African island holds a powerful monument to the tragedy of the slave trade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-slaves,"The transatlantic slave trade is largely consigned to public consciousness and history textbooks, but there exists many places where the full force of humanity’s cruelty can still be heartbreakingly felt, even if the place didn’t see much slavery itself. The House of Slaves on Gorée Island, Senegal is just such a place. The island itself, resting off the coast of Dakar, the capital of Senegal emits a rather somber vibe, something that more resembles a graveyard than a tropical island. There seems to be a respectful understanding that underneath the gentle sound of the sea breeze lurks the pain and silent screams of its past. Acting as a stopover where enslaved African people would be processed and shipped away, the House of Slaves was a market where Africans would be shipped by middlemen from mainland West Africa, and then traders could visit, and purchase enslaved people before leading them through what is now called the Door of No Return, filling small boats before returning to their main vessel stationed just off the island. The island is believed to have processed hundreds, perhaps thousands of enslaved men, women, and children, with some estimates even suggesting millions. However, many scholars have called the veracity of the island’s legacy and its House of Slaves into question. Historians are yet to settle the numbers, but it has been argued by many that the site was a minor location in the slave trade, and some have even questioned whether it was a part of it at all. Regardless of the actual numbers, most agree that what matters is the island’s symbolism, and the House of Slaves is best considered a memorial as opposed to a historic site. The voyage of enslaved people from the west coast of Africa to the Americas was known as the Middle Passage. Enslaved people endured traumatic conditions on slavers’ ships, including cramped quarters, disease, meager rations, and physical and sexual assault. The House of Slaves itself is now a museum. An evocative structure complete with iron shackles and dingy cells where the slaves were said to have been crushed together in horrifying darkness, awaiting their inescapable fate. The historical controversy aside, the site’s power as a grim testament to one of our species’ darkest eras has garnered visits from such luminaries as Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama."
2,The Great Green Wall of Africa,"Dakar, Senegal","Over 4,700 miles of trees being planted to hold back the desert.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-great-green-wall-of-africa-dakar-senegal,"The Great Wall of China was built over a millennium to ward off nomadic raiders. With Africa’s farmlands threatened by an enemy more pernicious than any Mongolian horde, Senegal is leading a 12-nation cooperative effort to erect a living defense system aptly named, the Great Green Wall of Africa. The Sahara is currently the second largest desert in size, only smaller than Antarctica. However, unlike its frozen relative, the Sahara is actually expanding. The United Nations estimates that, by 2025, two thirds of Africa’s arable land will be covered in Saharan sand, vastly expanding the current 9 million square kilometers. Even if these predictions prove aggressive, the effects of farmland destruction on a continent already hard-pressed for food would be devastating on any level. With this peril in sight, the leaders of Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Djibouti have banded together on an unprecedented endeavor to stave off impending catastrophe. Once complete, Africa’s Green Wall will be a manmade forest of drought-resistant trees (principally acacia) stretching across the entire continent. Nine miles wide and 4,750 miles long, the vision for the project is as ambitious as it is necessary. Thus far, only 330 miles of greenery stand guard in Northern Senegal, costing the Sengalese government over $6 million since the start of digging in 2008. International organizations have pledged over $3 billion to the monumental defense system. Leaders point out that the Great Green Wall is about more than just protection from windblown sand. The project will bring thousands of jobs to impoverished communities, and has already transformed otherwise unusable land into gardens scattered with tree nurseries. The influx of tourists, scientists, and medical professionals has also brought attention and resources to a neglected region in which aid is scarce and doctors are not readily available for the needy populations."
3,African Renaissance Monument,"Dakar, Senegal","This giant statue is the product of a mixture of corruption, Stalinist architecture, and North Korean manpower.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/african-renaissance-monument,"Dedicated in 2010 the massive African Renaissance Monument is a towering piece of brutal Stalinist machismo that is intended to celebrate the achievements of the African people but will likely be better remembered for the corruption and unpopular alliances that led to its construction. The monument, which sits atop a hill surrounded by trash heaps and unfinished homes, depicts a man, woman, and child who are ostensibly meant to be African yet look glaringly like chiseled Soviet caricatures. The statue would not be quite so alarming if it were not for its sheer size, topping out at over 160 feet of bronze nationalism or a little more than half the height of the Statue of Liberty. This makes it the tallest statue in Africa. The statue was the idea of then President of Senegal, Abdoulaye Wade. Wade was an octogenarian whose presidential service was marred by allegations of widespread corruption and nepotism, accusations that were only strengthened by the construction of the African Renaissance Monument. Opponents of the statue noted that the endeavor cost the Senegalese government over $27 million despite a country-wide economic crisis. In addition to the exorbitant price tag, the statue received a great deal of criticism due to the fact that it used very few African people in its creation. Despite claims to the contrary, it seems that the piece was designed by a Romanian architect and subsequently built by a North Korean construction firm. The design itself has also come under fire for its startlingly sexist overtones given the ripped male figure seemingly rescuing a damsel whose single breast has been revealed in the swoon. However despite the myriad protests and complaints, the African Renaissance Monument was completed in 2010. The giant landmark is expected to bring a great deal of tourist revenue to the country, however in a fiercely contested move, Wade himself claims 35% of all such revenue citing intellectual property rights. It seems like the renaissance might have a bit farther to go."
4,IFAN Museum of African Arts,"Dakar, Senegal",Dakar is home to one of the oldest African art institutions in West Africa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ifan-museum-of-african-arts,"Seminal artworks and artifacts from Mali, the Ivory Coast, Guinea Bissau, Burkina Faso, and beyond inhabit the l’Institut Fondamental d’Afrique Noire (IFAN Museum of African Arts) in the Senegalese capital. The museum’s noteworthy collection presents an important glimpse into West African history and the visual cultures that comprise this region. Ritual masks, instruments, clothing, and weapons occupy the IFAN Museum, one of the oldest and most prominent institutions dedicated to the research and exhibition of West African art and artifacts. Founded in 1936, the museum was formerly entitled Le Musée d’Art Africain de L’Institute Fondamental d’Afrique Noire Cheikh Anta Diop IFAN/CAD and then The Théodore Monod African Art Museum (named after the French naturalist Théodore Monod). Its establishment was notably supported by the first Senegalese president, Léopold Senghor, who served between 1960 and 1980. Today, the IFAN Museum also serves as the principal site of the Dakar Biennale (also referred to as Dak’Art and the Biennale de l’Art Africain Contemporain), a Dakar-based bi-annual exhibition of contemporary African art in operation since 1996.  The IFAN Museum of African Arts is open to the public from Tuesday through Sunday, 9 am until 5 pm."
5,Bantyii Dibiterie,"Dakar, Senegal",A smoky doorway in Dakar leads to one of the city’s great communal eating experiences.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bantyii-dakar,"In Sandaga Market, the bustling heart of downtown Dakar, smoke emanates from an unmarked doorway in a crumbling multistory building. Inside the dark and smoky interior is possibly the most interesting and least advertised restaurant in Dakar. This is Bantyii, one of the best-loved dibiteries in Dakar. Dibi is Dakar’s top street food: simply marinated chunks of meat, usually from sheep but also including chicken and beef, skewered and cooked up over charcoal on basic metal grills and served with baguettes, onions, and mustard. This preparation is popular across the region and many Dakar dibiteries are run by foreigners, especially from the Hausa community in Niger. In fact, Bantyii is not a single restaurant but really a collection of six or seven grills run by different dibi experts from Niger, Mali, Guinea, and Senegal. The customers are just as diverse, from working people getting their day’s main meal to wealthy residents enjoying an appetizer before a fancy dinner. Bantyii feels like a portal to the warm, tolerant heart of Dakar. Some people say this is the favorite dibiterie of Dakar’s musical legend, Youssou N’Dour; visit once, and you’ll understand why.   From the intersection of Avenue Place 52 and Avenue Jean Jaures, walk north up Ave. Jean Jaures past the large DISCOVER store and look for the smoky doorway on the right. Bantyi is open late, until at least 11pm. Small sheep skewers go for under 50 CFA (10 cents), while more complex offerings like peanut-coated skewers, liver pieces, and big chicken chunks cost more."
6,Fadiouth Shell Island,"Mbour, Senegal","An island made out of shells, including a cemetery.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/joal-fadiout,"Each step you take in Fadiouth is accompanied by a muted crunching of hundreds of clam shells. Streets are covered in layer after layer, and the entire island is built on millions of shells that have accumulated over generations. Shells are a part of everything in the town and are incorporated seamlessly into the architecture as well. While the streets paved in bivalves draw quite a crowd, the second shell island, connected to Fadiouth via stilted wooden bridge, is the true gem of the area. Known only for its cemetery, the second island is also completely made out of shells. Although its simple and barren landscape could easily be ignored, the island is in fact very special. 90% of people in Senegal adhere to Islam, yet this entire island attached to Fadiouth is dedicated to a cemetery of simple graves, marked by white Christian crosses. Also buried in shells, the cemetery is a strange monument to the minority religion of the nation, and has adapted to the island’s shell landscape to form a beautiful graveyard."
7,Langue de Barbarie,"Ndieulé Mbam, Senegal",A tree seems to grow from the ocean floor on this strange strip of sand slowly being overtaken by the sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/langue-de-barbarie,"A slim stretch of sand pokes just above the waters off Africa’s western coast. While looking at the landmass from the shore, you may see pelicans floating around a tree that looks like it’s growing from the ocean floor. It’s the remnants of a peninsula that once barred a river from meeting the sea. Stretching south from Saint-Louis, the Langue de Barbarie National Park is a narrow peninsula of sand that has historically been the nesting grounds for sea turtles and many species of migrating birds. Originally, the park sprawled uninterrupted from the edge of the city miles down to the mouth of the Senegal River, where it was marked by Fort Balacoss in Gandiol. In 2003, heavy rains in the region caused the Senegal River to rapidly rise, causing great concern about potential flooding in the historic city of Saint-Louis. Unknown people surreptitiously dug a 13-foot-wide canal into the peninsula the middle of the night in an attempt to lessen the flood waters encroaching upon city. But their attempt to stave off the flood went differently than planned as nature once again took control. The canal became a gateway for the water to begin invading the land. Within a month, the canal had stretched by thousands of feet and caused the former end of the river to fill with silt and finally close. Soon, the salinity of the river delta changed dramatically and the freshwater fish disappeared upriver. Many local fishermen were forced to change their livelihoods, causing some river fishermen to turn to the sea and even more to take their boats north to Spain and beyond. The breach continued to expand for miles, eventually letting the sea swallow several luxurious hotels. Much of the peninsula vanished beneath the water, essentially transforming the park into something better resembling a small island. Despite the changes to the region caused by the breach, the Langue de Barbarie still hosts many populations of migrating and local birds. Local communities are attempting to adjust to the challenges of being newly exposed to the direct force of the Atlantic ocean and the increasing salinity of their farmlands. Private tours are often available from hotels in the Saint-Louis if you are not staying near the park itself. The Océan & Savane has opened a new location on the mainland."
8,Gorée Island,"Dakar, Senegal","This tiny, tranquil Senegalese island serves as a powerful symbol of the Atlantic slave trade.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/goree-island,"Gorée is a peaceful island of about 45 acres with a permanent population of around 1,600 people. Pastel-colored houses sit along quiet cobbled streets, and there are no cars to shatter the calm. Historically, however, the island, with its deep harbor and defendable shores just off the coast of Senegal, has been fought over frequently by colonial powers, including the Portuguese, Dutch, British, and French. The island is perhaps best known for its role as a strategic trading post for the transatlantic slave trade. Its most famous building, the House of Slaves, was, by some accounts, the first stop for around 20 million African enslaved workers. And while the actual extent of Gorée’s involvement has been questioned by historians, it nonetheless serves as a symbol—a “memory island”—of the Atlantic slave trade. Though slavery existed in Africa before Europeans arrived, the demand for enslaved people in the European colonies of the Western Hemisphere greatly expanded the African slave trade beyond taking people captive in war. Central Africa lost as much as one-third of its population during the early years of colonial rule. Prime ministers, president, and popes have visited Gorée in recent years, including Pope John Paul II, Nelson Mandela, and Barack Obama. They, like the many tourists who make the pilgrimage to the island, toured Gorée’s various museums and the remains of colonial-era forts. And, of course, the House of Slaves, which sits at the heart of the experience. The former trading house serves as an emotional memorial to the brutality and suffering unleashed by the Atlantic slave trade. Reconstructed and opened as a museum in 1962, it displays the horrific treatment that enslaved people would have experienced in trading houses, where they were treated not as humans but as chattel. Tours take visitors through the Door of No Return. According to one of the museum’s main founders, the late Boubacar Joseph Ndiaye, as many as 15 million enslaved men and women passed through this door, never to see their continent again. Visitors also walk through the cramped basement cells, where guides point out shackles on the walls. Upstairs, the museum displays chains for the neck, ankles and feet; various tools used for punishments; and a 17-pound, cast-iron ball that was chained to any enslaved person suspected of daring an escape.  Gorée is located about 1.2 miles from the main harbor of Dakar. Ferries depart frequently between Dakar and the island, taking about 20 minutes. There is only one hotel on the island, so the majority of tourists visit as a day trip. You’ll need to pay a small tourist tax of CFA600 (about $1 US) when visiting the island, and the same for entering the House of Slaves."
9,Niokolo Koba Park,Senegal,This park was designated by UNESCO as an Endangered World Heritage site.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/niokolo-koba-park,"For visitors traveling through Senegal and desire to catch a glimpse of wildlife in their natural environment, the National Park Niokolo Kobe located in the eastern section of the country is the ideal place to visit. The park was established as a reserve in 1925 and was declared a national park in 1954. The park runs along the upper region of the Gambia River and was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in the 1980s. A wide range of different species and animals call this region home. It’s believed that some 60 species of fish and around 80 mammals live on the reserve. For more adventurous travelers, a small swinging boat on the river allows for a closer view of the hippos and crocodiles that swim in the water and sunbathe along the river rocks. The center of the park is set in a new, modern wooden structure by the river. It’s the perfect spot to watch the sunset.  If you are driving your own car, a ranger will stay with you from the entrance to the tourist center in the middle of the park. The road is unpaved and the trip takes a while. From the center, you can take part in tours to see the various animals, by jeep or boat."
10,Cap Manuel's Abandoned Bunker,"Dakar, Senegal",This abandoned bunker looks out over the Atlantic from its clifftop perch.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cap-manuels-abandoned-bunker,"First person account from Atlas Obscura user La Tortue Noire: “The man shakes his head and puts his arm in front of his eyes. The answer is clear, he doesn’t want me to take a close picture of him. I don’t know his name, we don’t understand each other. He seems to be living there, half fisherman maybe, half homeless. All his stuff is laying on the floor in colored plastic bags. Fish bake in the sun. The heat is so strong you can nearly touch it in the air. We are in an abandoned bunker built on top of a high cliff at Cap Manuel, south of Dakar, Senegal. The place is called “the cave” by locals (“la caverne”, in French). I found the bunker randomly, saw it in the distance. To go there you need to walk across bushes and take care not to slip on the red dust. The cliff being very close, I recommend paying attention to where you walk. Falling down here would be tragic, and the waves are so strong I guess no one but the hawks circling in the sky would ever know.” Dakar is built on a arrow of land, pointing West, and nowhere else on the African continent can you walk further into the Atlantic. My intention reaching Cap Manuel was to stare at the ocean, straight ahead, but to the South, not to the West and the Americas. Cap Manuel is a very particular place indeed as there is no land in front of you before you reach Antartica, 6,000 miles behind the horizon (9800 km). I wanted to take a look at this immensity. And when I got there, I saw the bunker. I first set foot on the roof. The view down the cliff is tremendous. The wind blows so hard I find it dangerous to stand on the ledge very long; there is no protection here. The waves rush onto the rocks, the noise is astounding. It seems that the roof is quite accurately facing South, it’s like a plane runway ready for take-off. I spent a few minutes there, staring at the horizon (and rehydrating after the walk in the sun), thrilled by the view and the remote place. Then I saw the stairs going down into the bunker. While I was inside, four or five young men stopped by, bringing the man in the bunker more plastic bags. No words were exchanged. They stared at me, surprised, but did not ask anything. I have no clue what this was all about. But I know that the man there lives in the sky. The platform in front of the bunker, where the sentinels probably stood, is now his own balcony on top of the cliff. Does he know, when he looks at the ocean every day, how far the next piece of land is?”  An easy walk from downtown Dakar. About 40 minutes from the Place de l’Independance (remember to bring water, there’s nothing there), down the Route de la Corniche. If you prefer, any cab will bring you there. Your goal is the Red Lighthouse of Cap Manuel (and not the White Lighthouse of Dakar). Then, just get closer to the sea and look for the bunker (and be careful not to slip)."
11,Mosque of the Divinity,"Dakar, Senegal",This unique religious structure is an architectural gem with arresting ocean views.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mosque-of-the-divinity,"It was 1973 when a holy man by the name of Mohamed Gorgui Seyni Guèye envisaged a grand mosque on the beach. He took his dream as a prophecy and a commandment from the Lord. The sacred site was indeed built on a beach in the ancient fishing village of Ouakam outside Dakar, completed in 1997. It’s known as the Mosque of the Divinity (Mosquée de la Divinité). Designed by the architect Cheikh Ngom, the Divinity Mosque is a sublime religious structure characterized by two towering minarets offering unparalleled views of the Atlantic Ocean. Since the mosque was unveiled, it’s become both an important Muslim pilgrimage site and a breathtaking point of interest for curious travelers. Visitors consider the mosque a must-see in the Senegalese capital of Dakar, not only for its sheer size and the panorama it offers, but as a unique architectural monument that melds elements of modernism with traditional Islamic design. From the top of the surrounding cliffs, the view looking out over the mosque backdropped by the ocean is picture-perfect.  The mosque is set next to the beach, off the main road. You can reach it from the road by walking down a long staircase or a cab can take you down. The mosque is also reachable by boat. The inside is not open to non-Muslim visitors, but the view of the picturesque exterior is worth seeing. The beach area also has great swimming, snorkeling, surfing, and the local fisherman sell fresh fish in the late afternoon."
12,Henriette Bathily Women's Museum,"Dakar, Senegal",This Dakar museum exhibits artworks and artifacts honoring the daily lives of Senegalese women.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/henriette-bathily-womens-museum,"Billed as “a tribute to all women,” the Henriette Bathily Women’s Museum was founded in 1994 on the small Senegalese island of Gorée. It operated there for two decades before moving to Dakar, where the space remains dedicated to exhibitions and educational programs about female Senegalese life. Annette Mbaye d’Erneville, Adama Cissé Wellé, and Ousmane William Mbaye teamed up in partnership with the Consortium of Audiovisual Communications in Africa to create an institution that focuses on female history and culture in Senegal. Named after Henriette Bathily, the director of a ballet company and a supporter of female African artists, the Henriette Bathily Museum aims to direct increased attention to the important parts women play in Senegalese society, including their social roles in the community and their place in ritual and art depending upon ethnicity. Through exhibitions, research, the development of archives, and museum journals, the museum endeavors to attract national and international interest in Senegalese culture through a female lens.  The Henriette Bathily Museum is located on Dakar’s Place du Souvenir Africain et de la Diaspora. Email info@mufem.org for more information."
13,Joal-Fadiouth Fishing Port,"Joal Fadiout, Senegal",West Africa's largest fishing port honors its artisanal fishing process.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/joal-fadiouth-fishing-port,"Joal-Fadiouth is one of the most important fishing ports of Senegal, and the largest artisanal fishing port in West Africa. Every step of the fishing process is handled in the traditional manner here, for example, the fishermen use pirogues, which are flat-bottom wooden boats small enough to easily take on land. Before exported to neighboring countries, the fish are dried on hundreds of wooden shelves in the pungent “fish drying zone” in the eastern part of the village. This zone covers acres of land. Like clockwork, the Joal-Fadiouth covered fish market is overwhelmingly crowded at five o’clock in the evening, when the fishermen get back from their pirogue adventures. Locals and tourists alike jockey for there share of the fresh catch. The market is on the right side of the village close to the beach, while the drying zone is to the east. Adapted with permission from Exploguide.com dedicated to travelers looking for alternative and off the beaten track travel. Joal-Fadiouth is 25km south from MBour, and 110km (S) from Dakar (3h drive) driving along the coastal road. Taxi and bus station at the entrance of the city from Dakar."
14,Faidherbe Bridge,"Saint-Louis, Senegal",A 19th-century architectural masterpiece with ties to Gustave Eiffel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pont-faidherbe,"The town of Saint Louis, set on an island at the mouth of the Senegal River, is a must-see location if you are traveling through Senegal. At the end of the 19th-century when the country was still a French colony, the governor decided that the old bridge composed of 40 floating pontoons needed to be replaced. The links of the new bridge were crafted by Gustav Eiffel and were originally designed to cross the Danube. In 1897, the bridge officially opened to the public. Composed of several iron arches, the bridge has a central mechanism that turns on a pillar to allow boat passage. The entire structure spans more than 1,000 feet (500 meters) and is UNESCO World Heritage-listed, along with the entire island of Saint-Louis. The bridge has been restored twice during its history due to the high salinity levels in the surrounding waters. It still requires constant maintenance to this day."
15,Forgotten Cannons of Sine Saloum,"Mar Lodj, Senegal",This rusting artillery is a relic of Vichy France's influence in West Africa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cannons-sine-saloum,"At the beginning of the Second World War in Europe, between May and September 1940, the government of Vichy France took the decision to shelter the gold reserved in the vaults of the Banque de France—the French equivalent of Fort Knox—so that neither the Allied nor the French resistance led by General De Gaulle could take control of it. Indeed, such a treasure could have represented a huge strategic advantage in the midst of hostilities. Part of this gold (about 1,100 tons) ended up hidden in Kayès, an African city in present-day Mali, which was then a French colony. One of the access roads to Kayès is maritime: it is a delta of mangroves located on the Atlantic coast, called the Sine Saloum, which is part of present-day Senegal. Vichy France took the decision to fortify this access road and had cannons, bunkers and military camps set up all along the maritime canal, in order to be able to repel a possible Allied expedition. These guns are mostly located along Cap Marniane, to the southwest of the island of Mar Lodj, Senegal. You can still see some of these cannons today. Most were rendered inoperable (their barrels were punctured) and have rusted in place. No invasion ever happened, and it is said that these guns never fired.  The cannons are all along the canal in Cap Marniane, Senegal."
16,Marie Antoinette's,"Victoria, Seychelles",One of the oldest restaurants in the Seychelles is one of the only ones left to serve bat.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marie-antoinette-s,"A rambling wood-and-iron mansion with a steep metal roof stands from the Seychelles’ colonial days. Today it’s home to the oldest restaurant in this Indian Ocean island chain. Marie Antoinette’s serves up Seychellois “creole” food, a fusion of Asian, African, and French flavors. Curry wafts on the island breeze. Lace tablecloths and bird of paradise flowers frame the open-air dining rooms. Marie Antoinette’s best dishes include sweet and sour tuna steak, tangy mango salad, light eggplant fritters, and grilled red snapper in a yellow curry sauce. Pulpy, tart passionfruit juice is an ideal drink. If you’re feeling adventurous, try the curried fruit bat. After your meal, don’t miss turtle-watching in the backyard run. Giant Aldabran tortoises are endemic to the Seychelles, and many locals keep them as pets. Marie Antoinette’s tortoises are survivors. In 2001, after days of heavy rain caused landslides, a one-ton concrete wall fell on them. They were at first assumed dead, but all 11 survived. Their tough shells protected them, although still-visible indentations show how they were nearly crushed. If it’s lunchtime, look out for Abraham. At 60 years old, this male tortoise still has a big appetite for the ladies. His favorite mating time, the restaurant says, is noon."
17,Moyenne Island,"Moyenne Island, Seychelles",A newspaper editor turned this abandoned island into a tortoise nature preserve that's now the world's smallest national park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moyenne-island,"Many of us fantasize about what we would do with our own island. Brendon Grimshaw turned his fantasy into a wondrous reality—a flora and fauna preserve, primarily housing over 100 land tortoises, the only human inhabitant watching over a paradise of endangered beauty. Grimshaw, who died in 2012, bought the island for a meager £8,000 in 1962. An adventurer with a love of nature and travel, he had always wanted an island to call his own, and was very attracted to the beautiful spots in Seychelles, window shopping for years throughout the smattering of Indian Ocean islands. Then, he met Moyenne, with its measly four types of trees so overgrown you couldn’t even walk past the beach and brush so dense coconuts never managed to hit the ground. It was a hard, long road to paradise, but with help from a partner, Rene Antoine Lafortune, and a bevy of misadventures (Tropical storms! Sharks!) Grimshaw developed the wild island into a gorgeous preserve, where he then lived with his Testudine friends. Moyenne Island, once an unkempt brush pile, is now home to 16,000 plants and trees, mahogany, palm, mango, and pawpaw that he painstakingly transferred to attract the host of native birds that flocked from neighboring islands. Nature paths wind in and out of the plant life, leaving room for visitors to explore, and explore they may, as long as they remember that the tortoises have the right of way. A reptilian version of a crazy cat lady, Grimshaw transported and bred roughly 120 tortoises onto the island, and they roam freely, many of them likely to have been destroyed on the other islands by development and careless humans. While under Grimshaw’s care, they flourished. Even today, visitors are reminded of whose home they are actually guests in by a sign that reads, “Please Respect the Tortoises. They are probably older than you” Bringing the island to life was Grimshaw’s greatest accomplishment. His efforts paid off: the island was declared a national park. Grimshaw had been offered as much as $54 million for the property but stubbornly refused, convinced that any buyer would destroy his tortoise paradise and turn it into another big hotel resort. It is now safely regulated as the smallest national park in the world, and also holds the distinction of having more species per square foot than any other national park in existence. Grimshaw chronicled both his life as an adventuring editor and his transformation of Moyenne in the book Grain of Sand."
18,Aldabra Atoll,Seychelles,Over two-thirds of the world's population of giant tortoises live among this coral formation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aldabra-atoll,"Comparable to the Galapagos Islands in terms of rare biodiversity, the Aldabra Atoll is a bastion for a number of exotic fauna, but mainly giant turtles. Aldabra, the second largest coral atoll in the world sits in the Indian Ocean, 265 miles from the nearest landmass, allowing the small island to remain virtually untouched throughout history. This isolation has, in turn, allowed a remarkable variety of species to call the coral formation and its central lagoon home. The most prevalent beast to be found on the island is the giant tortoise, of which there is thought to be a population of at least 100,000. With the global population of giant tortoises numbering only 150,000 in total, that is no small number of terrapins. In addition to the turtles the sunny, arid shores are home to the world’s largest species of crab, the coconut crab, and a rare type of bird known as the Aldabra Rail which is the only flightless variety of its type left in the world."
19,Abandoned Church,"Plaisance Ward, Seychelles","In the middle of a busy residential neighborhood, a small roofless church being reclaimed by nature.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-church-seychelles,"Churches of varying sizes can be seen throughout the islands of Seychelles. They are usually well looked after, often with small manicured gardens. It is, therefore, quite surprising to find an abandoned church in the outskirts of Victoria—even more so, considering that this church is nested in a populated area, next to a school, private houses, and a busy roundabout. The roots of Christianity in Seychelles can be traced back to 1756, when France claimed the islands. As Seychelles had no Indigenous population, when European settlers arrived aboard the ship Thélemaque in 1770, Captain Leblanc Lecore brought 15 French men, eight enslaved Africans, and five Indians to the island now known as Sainte Anne. After decades of French rule, Seychelles came under British rule in 1810. It was not until  1976 that Seychelles became an independent country. Christianity remains the most widespread religion in Seychelles, and Roman Catholicism represents the predominant form. Located in Roche Caïman on the island of Mahé, this structure is completely roofless and exposed to the elements. The vegetation is cut back from time to time, but it is clearly visible that medium-size tree trunks have grown through the windows. The vegetation has almost completely reclaimed the walls demarcating the apse and the three lancets. Some moss covers the ground, and weeds creep in between the cracks, but the slabs of rock used to tile the floor are still recognizable. There are neither fences nor custodians on site. The building is open to whoever happens to be passing by."
20,Vallee de Mai Nature Preserve,Seychelles,"A British general, a suggestive tree, a map of paradise.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vallee-de-mai-nature-preserve,"With its pristine beaches, crystal blue seas, and abundant natural beauty, it’s easy to see why people generally consider this collection of islands to be close to paradise on earth. But when British General Charles “Chinese” Gordon declared the island of Praslin in the Seychelles to be the Garden of Eden in 1881, he meant it much more literally. Gordon drew maps showing how the Seychelles, in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia, could be said to conform to the geography of the Garden of Eden, as described in the Bible. Even more specifically, Gordon found a species of tree specific to the islands, which he believed to be the actual Tree of Knowledge: the now-endangered coco de mer, said to look like the tempting female form. It’s also the largest seed on the planet. Gordon, who was called “Chinese” for his achievements putting down the 1860s Taiping Rebellion, was a renowned British general and eccentric Christian evangelist. After he was killed in the battle of Khartoum, his brother published a biography of him which included his Garden of Eden theory. More recently, the island was in the news as the honeymoon location of Prince William and Kate Middleton. If you visit the island, be sure to check out Vallee de Mai nature preserve to see some of the few remaining coco de mer trees."
21,Mission Ruins of Venn's Town,Seychelles,The remains of a 19th-century school and living quarters are perched atop a mountain surrounded by a thick tropical forest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mission-ruins-of-venns-town,"Deep in the Morne Seychellois National Park, perched on a mountaintop are the ruins of a mission named after Henry Venn, an Anglican missionary. Venn’s Town was a mission set up in 1876, and it consisted of a boarding school, dormitories, a laundry building, kitchens, washrooms, and dwellings for laborers, teachers, and the school principal. In order to sustain its operations, the mission cultivated vanilla, coffee, and cocoa among other produce over a large swath of land (approximately 50 acres). In the late 1800s, Seychelles became a haven for liberated enslaved people. Although the Emancipation Act abolished slavery in the British-controlled Seychelles in 1835, slave-trading in the area persisted. To curb the practice, the Royal Navy patrolled the East African Coast, intercepted slave-trading ships, and brought those they rescued to Seychelles. There, the adults ended up working in the local plantations as low-paid laborers. Meanwhile, Venn’s Town mission took in their children and provided them with some basic education between 1876 and 1889. This was a crucial point in the history of Seychelles, as these families and their descendants would forever change the Creole Seychellois identity that survives to this day. Today, the foundations and walls of five buildings remain over an area of 540 square meters (5,800 square feet). “The Laundry” stands out from the other buildings due to the clear-cut knee-high walls outlining 19 tiny chambers with evidence of rudimentary plumbing.  Thick vegetation from the forest covering the steep slopes of the mountain encroaches on the ruins, and a modern viewpoint platform offers sweeping views of the forest sloping down toward the coastal areas. None other than Queen Elizabeth II drank tea on this very same platform in 1972. Many types of plants and animals can only be found here, as well, ranging from the very small Sooglosus frog species to the Seychelles scops owl (Otus insularis).  A sign points at a narrow, steep road that branches off San Saucis Road and reaches the ruins."
22,Isle of Farquhar,"Roche Caiman, Seychelles","A schooner, nicknamed ""The Unsinkable,"" with a long history of survival in the Indian Ocean.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/isle-of-farquhar,"Isle of Farquhar, not to be confused with the Farquhar Group, which is a group of islands, is a three-mast schooner moored at Les Mamelles on Mahé, the largest of the islands in Seychelles. Built in 1909 in the Netherlands and originally named Zeemeeuw, this schooner changed owners, routes, and purpose several times before Captain Robertson Durup brought it to Seychelles, where it was used to carry labor, supplies, and produce from island to island. From its base there, Isle of Farquhar sailed all over the Indian Ocean, mooring at the Chagos Archipelago and Mauritius. Throughout its life, Isle of Farquhar faced rough seas and weather, and prevailed so much as that it was nicknamed “The Unsinkable.” This was due to particularly sturdy design and steelwork but it was a cyclone that eventually got the best of it.  Yet, true to its moniker, the vessel didn’t sink.  The strong winds broke the masts, but Isle of Farquhar withstood the shock. To these days, the broken masts rest along the hull.  Much of the steelwork is now rusting, and invading vegetation has made it an integral part of the inlet’s habitat.  There are plans to restore Isle of Farquhar in the near future.  It is possible to board the ship, but for now it is dangerous and ill-advised."

It’s a replica of a London clock tower located at Victoria Station and Vauxhall Bridge Road. The Victoria Clock Tower is also referred to locally as “Lorloz.” Originally painted black, the clock tower was re-colored silver in 1935 to commemorate King George V’s Jubilee. In 1999, the spring mechanism was replaced with an electronic one and the clock rang its first chime.  The clock tower is located at the intersection of Francis Rachel Street, State House Avenue, Albert Street and Independence Avenue."

25,Tiwai Island,Sierra Leone,This river island in Sierra Leone is home to impressive biodiversity and the country's first community conservation program.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tiwai-island,"Starting from the from the highlands of Guinea, the Moa River flows southwest toward the Atlantic Ocean. Along its path, the wide river hosts a cluster of islands. One of those is Tiwai Island, a 12-square kilometer piece of land in the southwestern region of Sierra Leone (about 30 kilometers from the Liberian border). In the Mende language, Tiwai means “big island”—appropriately, as it is one of the largest inland islands in Sierra Leone. In the late 1970s, Tiwai was recognized as a special biosphere for wildlife conservation. The island is a protected wildlife sanctuary with a lush rainforest and a rich biodiversity with a high concentration of endemic species—those found nowhere else in the world. Tiwai is home to some 9,000 plant species (20 percent of which are endemic), 785 bird species, 320 mammal species (with 11 different species of monkeys), 425 reptiles species, and 510 freshwater fish species (35 percent of which are endemic). Among mammals, the rare pygmgy hippopotamus is one of Tiwai’s most important animal representatives. These elusive, solitary animals are much smaller than other hippos—about half as tall and a quarter of the weight. They are more active at night, when they emerge to feed on swampy vegetation. Pygmy hippos are only found in the Gola Rainforest in Sierra Leone and in parts of Liberia. Management of Tiwai Island is handled by the Tiwai Island Administrative Committee,  the oldest community conservation program in Sierra Leone. The committee is made up of representatives from eight communities within the Koya and Barri Chiefdoms. These communities from the surrounding lands collaborate to protect the island and its resources in exchange for community development and livelihood assistance. Tiwai Island is a popular ecotourism destination as well as a research facility for visiting scientists.  Tiwai Island is reachable from Potoru village (the village people can provide the boat and the guides). Before COVID-19 ita was possible to sleep in the island in the research compound."
26,Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary,"Freetown, Sierra Leone","A rehabilitation center for confiscated, orphaned, and abandoned chimpanzees.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tacugama-chimpanzee-sanctuary,"The center was established for the rehabilitation of confiscated, orphans and abandoned chimpanzees. Located just outside Freetown, in the Western Area Peninsula National Park, Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary provides guided tour in a unique context, a forest enclosures, where is possible to see chimpanzees up close. The sanctuary was founded in 1995 by Bala and Sharmila Amarasekaran. Starting in the late 1980s, the husband-and-wife conservationist team had worked with primatologist Rosalind Alp to gather data on chimpanzees in the pet trade in Sierra Leone. Even after being rescued, many of the primates who had spent time as pets could not be returned to wild, which led to the idea for a chimpanzee sanctuary. When it first opened, there were five chimpanzees: Bruno, Julie, Charlie Boy, Philip, and Augustine. Since then, Tacugama has grown into a large and diverse organization. In addition to caring for nearly 100 chimpanzees on-site, the sanctuary is involved in community outreach, field research, and conservation education. Tacaguma even kept to work during Sierra Leone’s civil war, which ended in 2002. Tacaguma helps monitor the country’s chimpanzee population, and once hosted the only documented albino chimpanzee. The center also has several eco-lodges (without electricity) where visitors can spend the night."
27,Bunce Island,"Kupr, Sierra Leone",Home of the ruins of a British slave castle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bunce-island,"Twenty miles up the Sierra Leone River from Freetown is Bunce Island, the site of a former British slave trading castle. The castle operated from 1670 and 1808 and sent around 50,000 enslaved humans from the African Rice Coast to the Americas. Most of the slaves who went through Bunce Island were sent to South Carolina and Georgia, where knowledge of rice cultivation was in high demand. The island was also the site of an often forgotten battle during the American Revolutionary War when the (colonial-allied) French attacked and damaged the castle in 1779. The castle had been damaged or destroyed in a number of other previous attacks by the French and pirates (including one by Black Bart), but was rebuilt after each attack. After the British outlawed the slave trade in 1807, the castle was used briefly as a trading post, a plantation, and a sawmill before it was abandoned around 1840. One hundred seventy years later, vegetation overgrowth clings to the deteriorating ruins of the castle (parts of which still include a second-story level) and its fortress. Other remains include the island’s slave yards, watchtowers, prison, a factory house, dormitories, several 18th-century cannons, and a graveyard. In 1948, the island was officially protected by Sierra Leone, but historical preservation efforts have been delayed by civil war and other issues. In 2008, the World Monuments Fund declared the island one of the world’s “100 Most Endangered Sites,” but a recent joint U.S.-Sierra Leone five-year preservation effort looks hopeful and is in the process of preserving the site and erecting a museum on the island. The island has been called “the most important historic site in Africa for the United States,” and descendants of slaves increasingly make the pilgrimage to view the emotional and tragic site through which their enslaved ancestors were taken, held captive, and sold. Nowadays, the island is abandoned and is an endangered site."
28,Cotton Tree,"Freetown, Sierra Leone","The oldest of its kind in the country, this tree sits where formerly enslaved people are said to have founded the city of Freetown.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cotton-tree-freetown,"The historic symbol of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is a large kapok tree known as the “Cotton Tree.” According to legend, the tree gained importance in 1792 when a group of formerly enslaved people settled the site of what is now Freetown. After the American Revolution, the British granted freedom to the enslaved people who had fought with the Crown during the war. Some so-called “Black Loyalists” were given land and supplies to resettle in British-controlled Nova Scotia, while others went to London and parts of the Caribbean. In 1787, some 4,000 formerly enslaved people were resettled in Sierra Leone—regardless of where they or their ancestors had originally come from. Five years later, another group emigrated from Nova Scotia to Sierra Leone. According to the story, when the first boat arrived, they walked up to a large tree just above the bay and held a Thanksgiving service there, praying and singing hymns. That tree still stands, now between the courthouse and the National Museum. Though its exact age is unknown, it is known to have existed in 1787 and believed to be the oldest cotton tree in the nation. The Cotton Tree is an iconic monument in the capital and appears on the 10,000 Leones banknotes."

The railroad system operated until 1974, then shut down due to a combination of increased car traffic and country policy. Since that year, some of the locomotives were bought and shipped to Wales, the others were kept in the capital city of Freetown. They were stored in the former train workshop, with the intention to convert it into a museum. The collection survived despite years of neglected upkeep, and the workshop turning into a shelter during Sierra Leone’s civil war. From 1992 to 2002, some 50,000 people lost their lives and hundreds of thousands more lost their homes. Many of those displaced people found the former workshop complex and turned it into a temporary shelter. After the war’s end, the collection of railway engines was located and restoration work began. A team set about cleaning and repairing the engines as well as the workshop space. The museum officially opened in 2005, and has continued to grow since then. The museum shows maps of the railroads, their history, and photos of the stations. One of the unusual items in the museum’s collection is a couch specially made for Queen Elizabeth II to use while traveling through the country in 1961 (she never wound up using it). a tank locomotive built in 1915.  The museum is in Cline Town, the eastern part of Freetown. It is reachable with own vehicle or with taxi or bajaj."

According to UNESCO, “The Old Fourah Bay College is perhaps the single most influential institution in Africa in accounting for the penetration and acceleration of the spread of Western education on the continent.” The building was used until the late-20th-century. It also once housed the Sierra Leone Government Railway headquarters, and later the Magistrate court. During the Sierra Leone Civil War, the building was used as a  shelter and was burned in 1999. Only the external brick walls and iron entryway have survived. The World Monuments Fund lists this building as one of the “world’s 100 most endangered historic sites.”  The Old Fourah Bay College is inside the Freetown District Health Management Team (DHMT) compound.

These steps are one of only a few constructions still standing from that period and connected the wharf to the city. They were climbed by the newcomers, freed enslaved peoples, the Maroon from Jamaica, and Black American soldiers who fought against the 13 rebel colonies of America. These stairs sometimes are wrongly called “Portuguese Steps” because of their ancient look. They are also known as the “Freetown Steps.”  The steps are public stairs between two open roads, they are reachable 24/7 with no entrance fee, but they are in bad conditions."

One ethnic group responsible for cultural creations in Krio society were the Maroons. Maroons were descendants of the Kingdom of Ashanti peoples and were enslaved in Jamaica. Many escaped the plantations and rioted against the British. They were deported first to Nova Scotia, then onto Sierra Leone where they rapidly became an influential group in politics and economics. Maroons built one of the first and most iconic Krio cultural heritage sites in the country, the Saint John Maroon Church. The church was built in 1822 and is one of the first significant examples of Krio contribution to the new city of Freetown. Saint John Maroon Church is a small, humble white building. Part of the timbers and two of the surviving pews were taken from ships that brought Maroons to Sierra Leone."
34,The Milky Seas,Somalia,The world's largest bioluminescent area was undiscovered by science until 2005.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/milky-seas,"The world’s largest bioluminescent area, a patch of ocean roughly the size of Connecticut, went undiscovered by science until 2005. Known as the “milky sea,” it has long been a subject of folklore within the sailing world. It even showed up in Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea: “It is called a milk sea” I explained. “A Large extent of white wavelets often to be seen on the coasts of Ambouna, and in these parts of the sea… the whiteness which surprises you is caused by the presence of myriads of infusoria, a sort of luminous little worm.” Despite these tales of a great glowing ocean, the scientific community largely ignored them, as it was thought that the concentration of bacteria necessary to create such a massive glowing area was impossible. Then a scientist named Steve Miller decided to double-check. Searching the internet for recorded accounts of the phenomenon he came across the logs of the S.S. Lima which recorded crossing the milky seas in 1995. While it was presumed that no area would be large enough, or have a sustained enough glow to be captured by satellite imagery, Miller, with the help of Steve Haddock, acquired archival data from the U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program for the night that the Lima recorded the phenomenon. When they overlaid it with the coordinates recorded by the S.S. Lima, they suddenly saw it shining up at them: A huge bright area off the horn of Africa. Believed to be caused by the bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio harveyi, the glowing area measures over 15,400 square kilometers and was seen by satellite glowing for three nights in late January. It remains unclear how such a large congregation of bacteria can exist."
35,Laas Geel,"Hargeisa, Somalia",This cave located in the badlands of Somaliland contains some of the oldest cave art in Africa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laas-geel,"The Laas Geel caves and their marvelous contents have been known to locals for many years. However, they remained relatively unknown to the rest of the world until 2002. That year, a team of French archaeologists conducted a survey and documented the various cave paintings across the site. They discovered that the amazingly well-preserved paintings displayed both humans and animals; mostly dogs, cows, giraffes, antelopes, monkeys and possibly hyenas. Some of the researchers belonging to the team believed the cows represented divinity, as many of the paintings displayed them wearing robes. Several scenes also depict what appears to be humans worshipping cow-like figures and a woman caring for a dog. There have been difficulties in dating the paintings, but they are believed to be between 5,000 to 11,000 years old. Laas Geel is located within the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, just a few kilometers from the Hargeisa-Berbera road. Sadly, due to a lack of international recognition of the Republic, Laas Geel does not benefit from international funding or protection. The cave and dozens of other archaeological sites across Somaliland are vulnerable to looting and degradation from a lack of preservation.  Laas Geel is generally visited with a driver from Hargeisa as there is no public transport to the site. Any hotel in Hargeisa where foreigners stay will assist with organizing a visit and the necessary permits, along with an armed escort."
36,Hargeisa War Memorial,"Hargeisa, Somalia",A MiG-17 fighter jet sits atop this memorial to the indiscriminate bombardment of Hargeisa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hargeisa-war-memorial,"The Hargeisa War Memorial is an eye-catching monument in the center of Hargeisa, the capital and largest city of Somaliland. Not only is the monument’s dais covered in colorful—and on closer inspection, quite brutal—murals, on its top sits a downed MiG-17 fighter jet. In the late 1980s, Somaliland began a concerted attempt to break away from Somalia and the brutal dictatorial rule of Somali president Siad Barre. In response, the Somali Air Force began a large-scale aerial bombardment of Hargeisa, a stronghold of the rebel Somali National Movement. The indiscriminate bombardment destroyed at least 70 percent of the city and, combined with summary executions and ground attacks, resulted in the death of around 50,000 people, mostly civilians. This is now known as the Isaaq Genocide, or Hargeisa Holocaust. Despite the terrible cost, Somaliland declared itself an independent state in 1991. This was not internationally recognized, but Somaliland experienced relative stability in the years that followed, especially in comparison to the ongoing civil war that continued to engulf Somalia. Today, many countries at least recognize Somaliland as an autonomous region of Somalia. To mark the brutal bombardment of Hargeisa, and to honor those who lost their lives, a monument was later erected in the city center, on what is now known as Freedom Square. The colorful monument consists of a large dais, on the top of which sits a fighter jet. This jet, a MiG-17, was one of the Somali Air Force aircraft that took off from Hargeisa airport before turning back around to repeatedly bomb the very same city. It crashed during the bombardment and was later recovered by the rebels. As you walk closer to the memorial, you’ll see that the colorful murals decorating each side of the dais are in fact very dark in the nature of what they depict. They show scenes of life from the civil war: men with severed arms and legs; human limbs scattered across a battlefield; houses burning as jets fly overhead; and the summary executions of civilians. But there are also symbols of hope. A woman stands defiant, holding up the flag of the Republic of Somaliland as she looks up at the sky. And on one side of the dais, the image of the scarred and body-strewn battlefield peels away at the corner, to reveal just a glimpse of an alternative image lying behind, one of green lands and blue skies not ravaged by war and destruction. Update as of April 2022: Currently being modernized and is under construction.  The Hargeisa War Memorial is located on Freedom Square in central Hargeisa, along Independence Avenue (on Google Maps this square is called Khayriyada Memorial Square). Hargeisa is a city in the Woqooyi Galbeed region of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland. Currently it is being modernized and under construction as of April, 2022."

These wrecks are both gathered in clusters near the port, where the harbor is too shallow for the wrecks to sink fully, and can also be found farther out into the Gulf of Aden. Berbera is the capital of the Sahil region of Somaliland, an unrecognized sovereign state in the Horn of Africa. In ancient times, Berbera was one city in a chain of important commercial ports located along the Somali coast. It has remained an important place for trade into the modern period, and continues to serve as the main commercial harbor for the surrounding region. The oldest of the Berbera wrecks dates back to the Ethiopian War in the 1970s—specifically the Ogaden War with the Somali invasion—while the most recent comes from 2013 when a ship caught fire in the port and burned out. This means that a number can be seen from shore, while others will require a boat trip out to get close to; a number of restaurants on the waterfront have one that can be hired for this.  Berbera is a three-hour bus ride from Hargeisa. No security or additional permits are required for this route."

Here at the mouth of the Blyde River Canyon, the two rivers formed swirling eddies of water. Over time, this formed huge cylindrical potholes in the sandstone bedrock. The effect, seen from the crags above, is now a fascinating network of tunnels and tubes and interconnected whirling pools. The different soil levels in each hole give them each a unique color and makes for a striking and colorful landscape. The formations get their name from a prospector, John Bourke, who was one of the first to proclaim that the region had gold deposits and who staked a claim nearby. Despite the name of the potholes, he never found a single ounce of gold there — though luckier prospectors would later find rich amounts of gold in the area. Even if he walked away empty-handed, his name lives on in the stunning scenery. The Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve in which the potholes are located, has bridges and viewing platforms that allow visitors to see the interesting rock features from a variety of angles. There is also a small but interesting geological museum and short walking trails. The potholes are about 35km north of Graskop on the R532. Entrance fee is R25 per person plus R5 per car."

This beautiful beach is the home of over 2,000 endangered African penguins, and one of the few mainland penguin colonies in the world. The African penguin was long known as the “Jackass penguin” due to its grating, braying chirp. However the world is apparently big enough for two varieties of penguins with the same horrible voice, and the colorful term is now used to describe a species of penguin found in South America. The Boulders Beach birds, while endangered, were actually growing as a population in the 1990s as they bred on the scenic beaches and migrated in from other nearby colonies. However, the booming population became a public hazard as the noisy birds started tearing up gardens and annoying neighbors. The park was subsequently fenced off and made into a national park.   Boulders Beach has two different sections. Do not touch and feed the penguins when you visit any Cape Town beaches. Check the website for ticket prices. Inside there is a long boardwalk with penguins and dassies all around. Please do not disturb the penguins or leave the path."
40,Bo Kaap,"Cape Town, South Africa","Formerly known as the Malay Quarter, Bo Kaap is a colorfully-painted suburb located in the “Mother City” of South Africa.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bo-kaap,"In the 16th and 17th Centuries, the Dutch, who were occupying South Africa at the time, brought thousands of people (mainly Muslims) from Malaysia, Indonesia, and other African countries to the Cape of Good Hope as slaves. The descendants of these Muslim-majority slaves were segregated under the 1950 apartheid law into Bo Kaap, a neighborhood designated as “Cape Muslims only.” These Muslim communities, in part for the celebrations of Eid, painted their segregated neighborhood with a riot of bright colors, qualifying it as one of the most colorful parts of the world. From the center of Cape Town, it’s about a 10 minute walk to Bo Kaap, and you’ll know it when you arrive. One way cobbled streets weave through the vibrant one-story and two-story homes, stacked right next to each other with practically no open space between them. The colors directly overlap each other and strong lime green borders sky blue, light pink adjoins bright yellow, and pastel purple meets a full turquoise. Unfortunately the once segregated neighborhood is in danger of losing the Muslim community that made it so colorful. Since apartheid ended in 1994, allowing non-Muslims to live in Bo Kaap, the property taxes have gone up. Unable-to-pay Muslims were forced to move out, while white South Africans eager to live in such a richly-colored neighborhood moved in. (Apparently a handful of Cape Town’s non-Muslim women have also moved into Bo Kaap and converted to Islam in order to marry local Muslim men, citing their reasoning as, “they didn’t drink alcohol, so they made better husbands.”) Meanwhile, to counter this gentrification, activists living in Bo Kaap have emphasized cultural preservation and have been able to keep the percentage of outsiders owning Bo Kaap property at 15%, although this number is rising. Bo Kaap is one of the most brilliantly-colored and  historically-unique neighborhoods in all of South Africa. Hopefully it manages to hold onto its colorful cultural history and not just the paint job."
41,Adam's Calendar,"Ehlanzeni, South Africa","Hidden in the hills is a mysterious stone structure, known only to a few.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/adams-calendar,"In 2003, South African pilot Johan Heine was flying over the hills of the gorgeous Mpumalanga region of South Africa when he crashed his plane into the mountainside. After exiting the plane, Heine saw before him three monolithic, five-ton dolomite stones sticking out of the ground, and behind them a giant stone circle. Known to only a select few and accessible solely by rough dirt roads past the wild horses of Kaapschehoop, the megalithic stone calendar is dubbed Adam’s Calendar. With the shape of a circle and a diameter of 100 feet, it is nicknamed the “Birthplace of the Sun” and dubbed “Africa’s Stonehenge.” As with many similar stone monuments, it loosely aligns with the celestial world. The stone circle generated a fair amount of buzz after Michael Tellinger, a writer, claimed it is the oldest manmade structure in the world and was made by a vanished civilization. However, his claims have been widely disputed. As of now, the true age, origin, and purpose of Adam’s Calendar remains a mystery that is yet to be solved."
42,South African Astronomical Observatory,"Cape Town, South Africa",This historic observatory was established to keep shipwrecks from littering the Cape of Good Hope.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/south-african-astronomical-observatory,"In South Africa, the Cape of Good Hope is the official home of the South African Astronomical Observatory on top, and the unofficial home of more than 3,500 shipwrecks down at the bottom. Until the work of the South African Astronomical Observatory (the SAAO) began in 1820, the treacherous seas around the Cape of Good Hope saw more than 500 years of ships battering and crashing through the South Atlantic, with little to no usable stellar navigation established. Without the positions of the Southern stars accurately mapped, ships were often on their own, in unfamiliar waters and under unfamiliar skies. In 1820, a young Fearon Fallows was sent by the Royal Society of Astronomers to the Cape of Good Hope to get a handle on those southern skies, and maybe help a few ships’ captains avoid disaster. Fallows, a brilliant astronomer and mathematician, was from the same small town of Cockermouth in the north of England that produced the brilliant poet William Wordsworth and less brilliant (but maybe more colorful) Fletcher Christian of Mutiny on the Bounty fame. Despite his small-town beginnings, Fallows was talented enough to be dispatched to the other side of the world to accomplish a nearly impossible task – to get an observatory up and running while plagued by sand and dust storms, snakes, a lack of qualified stone masons (major stone work was required to stabilize early astronomical equipment), and the dreaded tablecloth clouds that could almost instantly block out the skies. But Fallows persevered, and the original structure for the observatory was completed in 1829. Sadly, the struggle may have taken the ultimate toll on Fallows, who passed away only three years later – dead from recurring scarlet fever, and buried on the grounds of his now-functioning observatory. Fallows’ plotting of the southern skies finally appeared in star catalogs in 1851, and his successor’s catalogue of Southern stars has held as a basis of refined sidereal astronomy (a field that relates to constellations and their daily movements) in the southern hemisphere. The observatory’s measurements were so precise for their time – this is still only 1833 – that they accurately measured the distance of Alpha Centauri (our next closest star, almost four and a half lightyears away) to within 1/5,000th of a degree. As the SAAO notes, that’s like measuring the diameter of a penny from two and a half miles away. The observatory eventually set up a campus of major telescopes in Sutherland, about four hours away from the main location in Observatory, in order to take advantage of its dark skies, with very little light pollution and mostly unfettered by clouds. There they’ve erected the largest telescope in the southern hemisphere, the aptly named Southern African Large Telescope, or SALT, which houses 91, three-foot mirrors to create a light-gathering surface of 835 square feet. That’s just one of their telescopes, but that’s a lot of light.  Cape Town main campus is in the suburb of Observatory off Liesbeek Pkwy. The Sutherland telescope facilities"

It’s the largest shop selling rare and used books in Africa, and potentially the entire Southern Hemisphere. Visitors to Collectors Treasury will find themselves stumbling into a plethora of second-hand books as soon as they enter the door. The books are packed into every corner and wedged atop any surface that will support them. They line the walls, are stacked into towering piles, and even occupy a bit of space in the elevator. Take some time browsing through the seemingly endless maze of literary delights to unearth some real treasures! Keep your eyes peeled while scanning the floor-to-ceiling shelves to spot some rare finds from around the world, such as first-edition prints and books that are no longer even published. Collectors Treasury also has maps, prints, engravings, newspapers, photographs, and thousands of vinyl records and 78 rpm discs, as well as a small selection of decorative art antiquities. It’s a mystery to most how the store keeps track of its enormous collection, and yet brothers Jonathan and Geoffrey Klass have managed to keep the family business growing. They founded the store in 1974 in a shop above a garage, and have obviously had to relocate to a space large enough to hold their massive stock."
44,Seal Island,"Cape Town, South Africa","Haven for Cape Fur Seals, until the Ring of Death of jumping Great White Sharks arrives.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/seal-island,"Located in False Bay just off the coast of Cape Town, Seal Island is a small granite landform absolutely swarmed with Cape Fur Seals. The piles of seals use the island as their main breeding ground and usually are left in peace. Humans have tried to inhabit the island, but failed, once as sealers in the early 20th century and later during World War II with an installation of a radar that was soon destroyed by the elements. However, the Great White Sharks also love the little island and at certain times of the year create a circle around it known as the Ring of Death. Any seal that swims too far is attacked by the sharks that actually leap from the water with the seals in their teeth before crashing down into the waves."
45,Sudwala Caves,South Africa,These otherworldly caverns form Earth's oldest known cave system.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sudwala-caves,"The Sudwala Caves in Mpumalanga, South Africa, are the oldest known caves in the world. They began to form about 240 million years ago as natural acid in groundwater seeped through the faults and joints of the region’s Precambrian dolomite rock. To put that unimaginable length of time into some context, when the cave formation began, Africa was still a part of Gondwana, the supercontinent that incorporated present-day South America, Africa, Arabia, Madagascar, India, Australia, and Antarctica. The caves are part of the Malmani Dolomite Ridge. Near the entrance to the system is a massive chamber measuring 230 feet (70 meters) in diameter and 121 feet (37 meters) high from the center of the chamber to its dome-like ceiling. The chamber is known as the PR Owen Hall, after Philippus Rudolf Owen. In 1965, Owen purchased the land on which the caves are found and opened them up to the public. Many other named features exist within the spectacular cave system, which stretches for many miles. There are strange speleothem structures—stalagmites, stalactites, and flowstones —with names like Samson’s Pillar, the Rocket, and the Screaming Monster. These began to form between 140 and 200 million years ago; the growth rate for a stalactite in the Sudwala Caves is about one inch (2.5 centimeters) per century. Other nooks and bizarre outcroppings bear titles such as the Devil’s Workshop and Fairyland, while a natural pattern on the ceiling of one chamber is known as the Map of Africa. Apart from primitive microbial fossils and a colony of about 800 horseshoe bats, signs of life inside the Sudwala Caves are scarce. Humans, however, have made their mark. Homo habilis, one of the earliest members of the genus Homo, lived in the caves around 1.8 million years ago, and some of their primitive stone tools have been found inside, along with archaeological finds dating to a few thousand years B.C. (some of these artifacts are displayed near the cave entrance). Far more recently, the caves served as a fortress and refuge for the Swazi prince Somquba. In the mid-1800s, Somquba was locked in a power struggle with his brother and heir apparent, Mswati. During the conflict, Somquba used the caves as a refuge with its own source of fresh water and plenty of room to stockpile food and house cattle. It was also a natural fortress, with a narrow entrance that could be easily watched and defended. Many battles took place at the entrance, which was under the charge of Sudwala, Somquba’s captain, after whom the caves were named. On various occasions, Mswati’s forces tried to smoke Sudwala and his men out of the cave, or suffocate them inside it, by starting fires at the entrance (burn marks can still be seen today). But due to a natural flow of air which exists inside the cave—the source of which is still unknown—Somquba and Sudwala were able to survive. The caves were later used by the Boers to store ammunition during the Second Boer War, which lasted from 1899 to 1902. At the end of the war, rumors began to circulate that President Paul Kruger had hidden a hoard of gold in the caves to protect it from the British. Known as the “Kruger Millions,” the treasure trove of gold coins is estimated to be worth around U.S. $500,000,000 in today’s terms. It still hasn’t been found. Since the 1970s, the main chamber of the Sudwala Caves has also been used as a concert hall. Capable of seating 500 people, it apparently has fantastic acoustics and a pleasant temperature, the latter thanks to the same flow of fresh air, the origin of which is still unknown, that saved Somquba.  The Sudwala Caves are located about 17 miles west of Mbombela (previously called Nelspruit) in the Mpumalanga province of South Africa. To get to the caves, turn off the N4 onto the R539 and continue for about six miles until you see a sign for Sudwala. Take the turning and follow the signs for just over a mile until you reach the caves. The caves are open every day of the year from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The standard entrance fee for adults is R100 (about $7.15 US). Or you can pay R450 ($32) for the Crystal Tour, which takes you about 1.25 miles into the caves to the “Crystal Chamber,” which is full of sparkling aragonite crystals."

48,Tapi Tapi Ice Cream,"Cape Town, South Africa",The frozen treats at this Cape Town parlor are inspired by Africa's food cultures.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tapi-tapi-ice-cream,"Even in South Africa, African food is not the default. And in Cape Town especially, dining can be quite Eurocentric. Centuries of colonialism erased indigenous foods and entrenched the idea that European food is somehow superior. These effects are still found today, but a microbiologist turned ice-cream maker, Tapiwa Guzha, wants that to change. With every handcrafted scoop served at Cape Town’s Tapi Tapi, he tells the story of his own food history, as well as stories from across the African continent. His freezers contain flavors like rondo ice cream, made with a nutritious edible clay consumed by pregnant women all over Africa, as well as botanical flavors such as black-jack, bitter leaf, and baobab. Sometimes Guzha whips up an ice-cream version of kelewele, a caramelized Ghanaian plantain snack with ginger and fire-roasted peanuts. Guzha’s recipes range from comforting to challenging. One of his more daring ice-cream flavors included matemba, a dried fish that he paired with toffee. Tapi Tapi is located in the heart of Observatory, an eclectic and diverse neighborhood in Cape Town. Guzha has painted his open-air parlor with his own artwork and words. As a one-man business, his operation is truly remarkable, open six days a week and closed for churning ice cream on the seventh. But Guzha’s passion for his creations and his mission keep him going.  Tapi Tapi  is also the home of “Iwe neni,” Guzha's food accessibility project where he makes nutritious meals for hungry locals. You can donate money or produce to Guzha’s feeding scheme, or pay it forward by donating ice cream to someone else. This allows Guzha to offer ice cream for free to someone who would like to try it but has financial limitations. He also offers a barter system. If you have an ingredient that you think would make a good flavor, you can exchange it for ice cream. The shop is closed to the public on Mondays. But you can learn how to make ice cream for free by joining Guzha for Monday morning churning. He’ll teach you the ropes, and you’ll get to take some dessert home."
49,Howick Falls,"Howick, South Africa",Local lore says a serpent-like beast lurks in the deep basin below the falls.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/howick-falls,"This picturesque waterfall is created by the Umgeni River plunging into a basin below. According to local folklore, a serpent-like creature dwells within the pool of water at the bottom of the fall. The thunderous Howick Falls drop more than 300 feet. The falls also go by the name of KwaNogqaza, which translates to the “Place of the Tall One.” It’s said that only sangomas, the traditional healers of South Africa, can safely approach the falls. Legend says the Inkanyamba, a monstrous creature with a serpent’s body and a horse-sized head, lurks within the basin. The beast is believed to have the most power in the summer, when its rage sends storms rushing across the region. The serpent isn’t the only powerful aspect of the waterfall. People wading into the river atop the fall have been swept over the edge and sent to a brutal, watery demise. At least 40 deaths have been recorded since the falls were discovered by European explorers in the 1800s.  A platform offers the best view of the falls and is easily accessed by the nearby road. An information board tells more about the stories regarding the waterfall. It's best to go during daylight hours. Take caution if hiking near the top of the waterfall, as the river can be dangerous."
50,District Six Museum,"Cape Town, South Africa",A sobering account of the vibrant multicultural neighborhood that was destroyed under apartheid.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/district-six-museum,"District Six, or “Distrik Ses” in Afrikaans, was a bohemian, mixed neighborhood in every sense of the word. It was crowded with a multiracial blend of working class people, Jews, Muslims, and Christians alike, many of whom were descended from formerly enslaved people and immigrants. In the mid-20th century, a population of roughly 60,000 lived there. Unfortunately, District Six was also at the epicenter of apartheid in Cape Town, and still bears its scars. After South Africa’s National Party gained power in 1948, its all-white government began enforcing policies of racial segregation known as apartheid. In the 1960s and 70s, the segregating Group Areas Act saw all the non-white residents of District Six evicted and relocated further outside the city. It was called “slum clearing,” and the true intention of the racial discrimination was to fill the desirably-located neighborhood with white residents and high rise buildings. District Six became a symbol of apartheid oppression. A group called Hands Off District Six protested the redevelopment of their bulldozed neighborhood. It remained empty. When anti-apartheid legislation came to fruition, reparations were paid to the resettled residents of the district. Some of them, along with their descendants, have been permitted to move back to the area. Others have been given financial compensation, but righting the wrongs is slow and still ongoing. The excellent and sobering District Six Museum provides context as well as rotating exhibits on the residents who were forcibly removed from their homes. Another highlight is St. Mark’s Anglican Church, built in 1867. The government was unable to bulldoze the historic religious building, and instead offered its clergy a resettlement stipend. They declined, and St. Mark’s continued to host the same community in the original location, now driving from all over Cape Town to attend service. What’s left of District Six is now part of the Zonnebloem neighborhood. A new generation has begun to rebuild there, but a small patch of land sits empty and deserted, a reminder of the cultural destruction that occurred.  The District Six Museum is located at 25A Albertus St & Buitenkant Street. Cape Town Free Walking Tours (http://www.nielsentours.co.za/capetown/) operates a free walking tour twice a day. Taking a tour is highly recommended, as it's easy to miss some of the landmarks if you don't know your way around."
51,Ponte Tower,"Johannesburg, South Africa",The tallest residential building in Africa is an unsettling Brutalist monolith.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ponte-tower,"Looking upwards from the inner courtyard of Ponte Tower can be an unsettling experience. A small patch of blue sky surrounded by a 173-meter-high cylindrical matrix of identical windows is all you can see. It is a dehumanizing habitat, an example of “Brutalist” architecture that was truly brutal. Ponte Tower, also known as the Ponte City Apartments, was built in 1975, and is still the tallest residential skyscraper in Africa. It is a 54-story tube with an open center to allow additional light to reach its inner apartments. The building was designed by Manfred Hermer. Ponte Tower was a true example of Apartheid-era thinking. The apartments facing the outside of the building were designated for rich white families while the inner apartments, in permanent twilight, were meant for their black servants. Life in the building became truly brutal after the fall of Apartheid. As crime rose in the once-upscale Hillbrow neighborhood, numerous gangs moved into the building. Ponte Tower became a center of organized crime activity, and life in the building become extremely unsafe. Owners all but abandoned the structure to decay. At one point the garbage piled five stories high in the open inner courtyard of the building. Should one desire they can rent a 3-story, 6-bedroom penthouse for R2700,00 p/m on the 51st floor, and while the area is still one of the worst in Johannesburg, the building has improved slightly. The drug dealers, once a large presence in the building, have mostly moved to the Sands Hotel around the block. The building is currently under new ownership, and undergoing renovation."
52,Sun City Resort,"Sun City, South Africa",A safari-themed castle in the South African bush with the largest maze in the southern hemisphere.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sun-city-resort,"Just a two-hour drive from Johannesburg towers a giant castle, accessible through a path lined with a herd of elephant statues. This castle’s main fountain spouts water out of the horns of sable antelope, and the courtyard contains a life-sized replica of Shawu, who had some of the longest tusks of any elephant ever discovered in South Africa’s Kruger National Park. This safari-themed castle in the South African bush is the Sun City Resort, a marvelous palace with a bizarre geopolitical history. Sun City Resort was built in 1979 by business magnate Sol Kerzner just northwest of Johannesburg. At the time, this region was under the autonomy of Bophuthatswan, an independent state created under apartheid. Kerzner chose the controversial region as the site of his palace because it was the nearest place to Johannesburg that permitted topless venues. Kerzner had always dreamed of building a “mythical royal residence built by a lost tribe” in the middle of the South African bush, and just that he did—Kerzner’s brainchild would make both Indiana Jones and Walt Disney proud. In addition to the countless statues of safari animals, the “Big Five”—lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants, and Cape buffalo—can be found in living form at the resort. In the adjacent Pilanesberg Game Reserve, visitors to the resort can self-drive their cars through the African bush. Past the majestic Palace of the Lost City and the sandy poolside beach, visitors can explore the largest maze in the entire Southern Hemisphere, a 300,000-piece mosaic of a lion killing a wildebeest, lamps held up by tiny monkey statues, and a 1.25-mile zipline, the fastest in the world."

This system of limestone caves became famous with the 1947 discovery of the two-million-year-old fossil skull dubbed “Mrs. Ples.” After this monumental find, work continued at the site for decades. Then in 1997 “Little Foot,” a hominid skeleton aged at about 3.5 million years, was discovered in the caves. In addition to these two “stars,” the caves have also produced over 500 other fossils. With such a successful rate of finds at the site, work has continued there to this day. The caves have also been opened for visitors to tour portions of the active dig site. Here, more than anywhere else in the world, guests may be likely to stumble upon one of their own ancestors."
54,Topi of Boma National Park,South Sudan,"Every October, one of the largest migration of mammals in the world thunders through Boma National Park.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/topi-antelope-boma-national-park,"Every fall the plains of South Sudan, normally pale yellow and brown, turn a vibrant viridescent shade. This explosion of greenery helps spur on one of the largest mammal migration in the world. Every October, at least a million antelope thunder across the plains towards the vast lowlands around the White Nile. An estimated 125,000 of the migration’s participants are the spectacularly weird topi. With an estimated 300,000 spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the topi migrating through South Sudan number a little less than half the entire population. These medium-sized antelopes are a deep, burnish brown with black splashes across their foreheads, thighs, and hips. They also sport light tan “socks” allowing their legs to blend into the tall grassy plains they call home. Topi are an extroverted species that have been known to socialize with animals beyond their own species, like wildebeests, zebras, and even ostriches. They are notoriously picky eaters: the topi only graze on grass and can go without water for long periods, so long as the grass is fresh and well-hydrated. Perhaps weirdest of all, female topis can actually delay birth if they sense they’re in danger. The Sudd wetland, through which the topi migrate every year, is currently on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Sudan. It’s a move that has brought more attention to the region and its animals as South Sudan’s bloody seven-year civil war came to a close in 2018. However, there are real concerns around the rise in poaching, the unregulated extraction of natural resources, and human encroachment in the Sudd. While the civil war ended in 2018, violence between armed communities has continued in South Sudan over land disputes and post-war grievances straining conservation efforts in the region. Throughout all the violence though, the topi migration has continued undeterred. Paul Elkan, head of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s South Sudan program, said in an interview, “the country’s wildlife is one of those special features of South Sudan which still arouses some hope.”  The migration occurs every October following South Sudan’s rainy season."
55,Sudd Wetland,South Sudan,The inhabitants of the world’s largest wetland have learned to navigate its dramatic seasonal changes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sudd-wetland-south-sudan,"South Sudan’s Sudd Wetland, also known as Al-Sudd, is one of the world’s largest wetlands, covering more than 35,000 square miles in the north-central part of the country. The White Nile, its many tributaries, and seasonal rainfall sustain the vast wetland. Currently being considered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Sudd is home to a vast array of flora and fauna, including endangered African elephants, an endangered antelope known as the Nile lechwe, and the critically endangered (and highly photogenic) shoebill. The Sudd is also the site of a huge antelope migration every October, including the spectacularly weird Topi. Approximately 1 million people live in the Sudd Wetland, many of whom come from Indigenous tribes that have inhabited the area for thousands of years. There are the Nuer and Dinka, two pastoralist peoples that make up the largest ethnic groups in South Sudan. Raising cattle is the primary livelihood for both of these groups, and many social rituals incorporate the animals. Husbands-to-be give cattle to family members of the bride, and Nuer priests often settle feuds through the exchange of cattle. In a centuries-old ritual, Dinka boys transition into manhood when they stop milking cows. Another group, the Shilluk, are primarily sedentary farmers. According to tradition, the physical and spiritual well-being of their chosen leader was tied to the overall prosperity of the land. The Anuak people are also farmers and maintain herds of cattle, sheep, and goats. Like many others, they also fish in the wetlands and set up seasonal fishing villages. The Neur, Dinka, Shilluk, and Anuak have all adapted to the seasonal changes of the Sudd. The Sudd’s dry season, between December to February, often sees nomadic communities move deeper into the wetland to graze their herds and hunt the Sudd’s plentiful fish. Communities, especially the Dinka, will build seasonal, circular homes on naturally-occurring islands in the wetland during the dry season. During the Sudd’s wet season, between March to August, many move back out of the Sudd to settlements near water deposits in the savanna. After gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan descended into a violent civil war. During the peak of the fighting, the United Nations estimates that 65,000 to 100,000 people escaped into the Sudd, reported National Geographic. For centuries the Sudd, which literally translates to “barrier,” has been a sanctuary for people fleeing violence, slavery, and oppression. But the recent influx of so many people has meant more competition for resources in the Sudd. Foreign oil companies have also secured contracts to mine the Sudd’s naturally-occurring oil deposits, posing yet another risk to the wetland. Initial oil surveying has already polluted the delicate ecosystem. Many hope that if the Sudd does become a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the international status would protect one of South Sudan’s most precious natural wonders.  Most of these communities are extremely private and are not visited by outsiders."

Meroë was an ancient city in the Kushite Kingdom, and the sheer number of its still-standing pyramids indicate that it was a massive city, once bustling with traders and everyday inhabitants. (And, most obviously, a booming tradition of masonry.) Archaeologists have identified that the numerous pyramid structures are very clearly in the Nubian style. The structures’ sharp angles and relatively narrow footprints carry all the hallmarks of the former Kushite Kingdom, meaning Meroë was a pinnacle location in one of history’s greatest and least-understood civilizations. The kingdom stretched throughout this region in ancient times. But now, little more than the dusty pyramids standing solemnly in the desert remain of the city and, by proxy, of the Kushites it belonged to. But with more than 200 of them to mark the location, they are quite enough to astound visitors and historians alike."
57,Suakin Island Ruins,"Suakin, Sudan",Remains of an abandoned coral city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/suakin,"For 3000 years, the port on the island of Suakin was strategically crucial to powerful empires. Located on the Red Sea in Northern Sudan, the former port of Suakin is now a crumbled relic of the wealth that passed through its coral walls from around the world. Ramses III initially developed the port of Suakin during the 10th century B.C.E. At the time, Suakin offered an outlet to the Red Sea for trade and exploration. 1000 years later, as Islam gained followers and spread from the Hijaz region of modern day Saudi Arabia, the port took on new importance and became an outlet for Africans on pilgrimage to Mecca. While Suakin constantly evolved, it remained prosperous throughout its existence, bringing great riches to the shores of Sudan. Local legend tells of a king who operated out of the old city and had 360 wives and lavish quarters in the old city. Stemming from its great wealth, Suakin developed into a rich, gated island port. Every building was made out of stunning coral and the walls were decorated in detailed wood and stone coverings. Suakin was the height of medieval luxury on the Red Sea. During the 19th century, Suakin evolved for the last time, becoming a hub for the slave trade from Eastern Africa. As the slave trade diminished, the port became increasingly unnecessary. By the 1920s, Suakin was falling into complete disrepair. Shallow waters and rough coral had pushed most trade North to Port Sudan and the coral buildings that were once the crown jewel of the port were not maintained and disintegrating. Only ruins of the once great coral city still exist and are carefully guarded as part of the tourism industry. Besides being a tourist destination, the port still serves ferries to the Saudi coast and provides access between the continents for thousands of pilgrims completing the Haj every year.

58,Précontinent II,Sudan,"All that remains of Jacques Cousteau's 1960s underwater ""village.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/precontinent-ii,"Précontinent II is the last visible reminder of a series of three French underwater habitats built between 1962 and 1965. Developed by the world-famous oceanography pioneer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the underwater “village” was supposed to be proof that it’s possible for humans to live underwater without interruption for extended periods of time, at increasing depths. The habitats were also built to explore the underwater world and conduct research for the petrol industry which financed the project. The project was named précontinent for the French word for continental shelf, the edges of a continent that are covered by ocean. Précontinent I was the word’s first underwater habitat, located in the Balearic Sea off coast from Marseille. It was completed in September 1962, two years before the American Sealab project. Two aquanauts, Albert Falco and Claude Wesly, lived in the habitat, a five-meter steel cylinder known as “Diogenes.” The habitat was fixed 11 meters under the surface of the water and fed with compressed air. Hot water came through a plastic pipe from a ship, and food in waterproofed containers. Other  “furnishings” included infrared lamps used as heaters, a record player, a radio, three telephones, a video surveillance system, a library, a TV and a bed. In the bottom of the habitat was an airlock, which allowed the two men to exit into the ocean, where they built compounds for fish and studied their behavior, and took measurements for topographical underwater maps. A year later, Précontinent II was launched about 35 km northeast, near the Sha’ab Rumi (Arabian for “Roman Reef”), off the coast of Port Sudan. The so-called Starfish House lasted for four weeks, housing a group of oceanographers as well as Madame Cousteau and the parrot Claude, who was supposed to warn the aquanauts of possible danger in the air. A second Précontinent II habitat, the “Deep Cabin”—a smaller version of the one used in Précontinent I—was installed even deeper into the sea, at 27 meters under the surface. Other structures were built including a tool shed and an air-filled hangar containing the Hydrojet Saucer DS-2, a small submarine for two people, which was equipped with three movable outside lamps, two cameras, a radio, a tape recorder and a movable grappler. The mission was to observe and collect fish and other organisms for exhibition and studies at the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco. Jacques-Yves Cousteau also wanted to prove that it would be more practical to anchor offshore drilling rigs at the bottom of the ocean than to place them above water, as well as prove the existence of a richness of minerals around continental shelfs. Précontinent III was supposed to start on September 17, 1965. This time the habitat was a dome constructed on a platform, with much-improved technology, and housed several aquanauts including Jacques-Yves Cousteau. However, the launch hit a snag. The habitat had already been brought to the diving place, sealed and put under pressure when the weather turned bad. It was brought back to the harbor where the aquanauts stayed in the habitat and under pressure, waited for the weather to change. Four days later the project was launched in earnest and the habitat anchored 100 meters below the surface, off the coast of Monaco near the Cap Ferrat lighthouse. The project lasted 22 days and its mission was mainly related to oil production—for example, how to assemble a drill head under water. This was the last mission of the Précontinent series, even though six missions in total were planned. Jacques-Yves Cousteau changed his mind and decided he didn’t want to be a part of research for the petrol industry anymore. Instead he dedicated his career to the exploration and protection of the world’s oceans from then on. From the three Précontinent missions only part of Précontinent II remains underwater, and has become the site of many diving tours from Sudan and Egypt. At the anchor place of the habitat you can find the remains of the tool shed, crusted with coral growth, and the fish cages, covered with sponges. A few meters deeper are the shark cages, covered with coral and crustacean, and the hangar, which still stands anchored in the bottom of the ocean, still filled with air and possible to enter. Diving tours can be booked through various sites on the internet."
59,Jebel Barkal,"Marawi, Sudan",Crumbling pyramids and temple ruins stand within the shadow of this sacred butte.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jebel-barkal,"Weathered pyramids spike upward amid sweeping stretches of golden desert sand. They stand in the shadow of Jebel Barkal, a small butte that was considered sacred thousands of years ago. The Egyptians, then later the Kushites, transformed the 322-foot-tall sandstone monolith into a trove of architectural treasures. Roughly a dozen pyramids are scattered around the base of the mountain, as are the ruins of temples, statues, and hieroglyphics. One of the temples was dedicated to the god Amun, who was believed to live atop the butte. The Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III first extended his empire to include Jebel Barkal around 1450 BC. Later pharaohs and Kush rulers oversaw the construction of the many pyramids that still stand around the landmark. The Kushites restored the neglected temples and continued building more structures around the base of the butte. But in the many centuries since the Kushites ruled the land, the stately pyramids have fallen into disrepair. The temples are little more than fragmented ruins, partially buried beneath the sand. The structures at Jebel Barkal are among the many pyramids that dot the Sudanese landscape, as the country has more than twice the amount of pyramids as Egypt. However, many of these sites are far off the typical tourist track, meaning those who take a trip to Sudan will likely have these monuments all to themselves. The pyramids of Jebel Barkal are within walking distance from Karima city center."
60,Sheikh Hamad-al Nil Tomb,"Omdurman, Sudan","Every Friday, Sufi dervishes whirl around the tomb in a trance-like state as part of a sacred ritual called dhikr.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sheikh-hamadal-nil-tomb,"Every Friday evening, Sufi dervishes perform a ritual called dhikr at the tomb of Sheikh Hamad-al Nil, a 19th-century Sufi leader. The devotees dance and work themselves into a frenzy while reciting Allah’s name, helping to create a state of ecstatic abandon that supposedly allows their hearts to communicate directly with God. The ceremony begins when the dervishes make their entrance to the cemetery dressed in colorful patchwork robes with bright beads draped around their necks. They then proceed to a patch of cleared ground in front of the mosque while banging drums and chanting while a man attempts to enforce the perimeter boundary. Although he carries a large club, he still struggles to maintain order as the crowd is, by now, wild with excitement. Fights break out among the more belligerent adherents who appear to taunt each other (quickly dealt with by the club-wielding man). Wild-eyed priests dance around the perimeter and blow incense into the faces peering out from the mass of spectators. The proceedings become more electric as the evening wears on. The rhythmic chants of “La Illaha Illallah” (there is no god but Allah) become hypnotic. Every so often a devotee breaks off from the main group, spinning in a blur of arms and legs. With eyes rolling, the dancer seems to enter into a trance-like state before collapsing onto the ground. The ceremony begins around 4:30. Visitors are treated with respect despite the fighting and theatrical bad tempers among devotees. It’s hard not to be swept along with the ritual. When it ends, you almost feel as if you’ve suddenly snapped out of your own trance.  It is better to have a local guide to help experience this ceremony. They know the best place to be positioned to get a good view and can match the belligerence of the locals to get you there (in a way which would probably best not be attempted by a tourist!)."
61,Western Deffufa of Kerma,"Kerma Albeled, Sudan",The best-preserved example of a unique structure in Nubian architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/western-deffufa-kerma,"The word defuffa is thought to derive from either the Nubian word for a mud-brick building or the Arabic word daffa, meaning “pile.” There are only three deffufa remaining in the world, all of which are located at the former site of the Nubian Kingdom of Kerma, which existed between 2500 and 1500 B.C. The remains of the walled city of Kerma is one of the largest archaeological sites in ancient Nubia. Archaeologists have identified a system of roads and well-differentiated neighborhoods. It is likely that this metropolis was reserved for members of the royal elite and the ruling class. Though Nubian rulers maintained the kingdom’s independence for nearly a thousand years, the kingdom of Kerma ended around 1450 B.C. with the conquest of Kush by Egypt. Even today, the Western Deffufa dominates the ruins of Kerma. It measures 18 meters (59 feet) tall, with columned rooms, passageways, paintings, and a shrine. It is the best-preserved example of this structure in Nubian architecture. The deffufa once functioned as a temple and the religious center of the city. It has multiple levels, with an interior staircase connecting the floors and leading up to a rooftop platform. Additional chambers underground were accessible through galleries. Evidence of a limestone altar, built for animal sacrifice, was also found. Though the precise functions of the deffufa are not fully known, it is believed they were connected to religious and burial practices. About two kilometers (1.2 miles) away lie the remains of the Eastern Deffufa, which is believed to be a funerary chapel and burial ground. Excavations at Kerma started with an Egyptian and Sudanese survey made by American archaeologist George A. Reisner in the early 20th century. Following up on that work, Swiss archaeologist Charles Bonnet led a series of excavations at the site from 1977 to 2003. It was this work that helped uncover evidence of Kerma as a large, independent urban settlement, rather than an Egyptian satellite as initially thought.  Kerma is located in central Sudan and is easily reached by public transport from either Khartoum or Karima."
62,Church Pillars of Sai Island,"Wadi Halfa, Sudan",These pillars are one of the few remnants from the mysterious lost empire of Makuria.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sai-island,"Sai Island is a tiny island in the Nile stretching just five kilometers across and 12 kilometers long, but it contains ruins spanning thousands of years and several empires. Though Sudan is now primarily an Islamic country, a medieval Christian empire known as Makuria flourished in Sudan between the 7th and 14th centuries. Despite the length of its existence, there are still many unanswered questions about Makuria and its people. Sai Island was once a bishop’s see (residence). The last remnants of the church of Sai Island can be seen as a few lonely pillars surrounded by pottery and masonry remnants. Old Dongola, to the south of Sai Island, is the only other archaeological site surviving from the Makurian empire. Sadly, when Lake Nasser was created much of what was northern Makuria was flooded including one of its main religious centers, the site of the Cathedral of Faras. There are other ruins on Sai Island, including the foundations of an Egyptian town and temple that date back to 1500 B.C., with the ruins of an Ottoman fort built on the site of the town. There are also Islamic cemeteries on the island with their characteristic dome-shaped tombs.  Sai Island is about four kilometers south of the town of Abri. Opposite the northern tip of the island from the banks of the Nile, a ferry operates to and from Sai Island. There is a fee for visiting the island which is generally payable in U.S. currency. Be aware that there is no set place to pay, and therefore it is reliant on the official making contact with you during your trip."
63,Battle of Abu Klea Memorial,"Al Matammah, Sudan",A remote monument to one of the fiercest battles fought by the Victorian British Army.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/battle-of-abu-klea-memorial,"Far out in the Bayuda desert, seven hours’ drive north of Khartoum, lies an almost forgotten memorial to a very famous battle, Abu Klea. On the 17th of January, 1885, a British column of approximately 1,400 men on its way to relieve the besieged General Gordon in Khartoum was attacked by 13,000 Mahdist forces. Even though the action didn’t last that long (about 15 minutes), Abu Klea has become infamous as one of the hardest battles ever fought by the British Army. In that brief period, extreme violence occurred that turned “the sand of the desert sodden red” with the blood of over 1,000 Dervish and 81 British troops killed. It was also one of the few occasions a British square had been broken by “native” troops, as immortalized in Rudyard Kipling’s poem “Fuzzy Wuzzy.” A memorial stone erected shortly after the battle names the British dead and marks the spot where the front left of the square was approximately positioned. The battle site is in a remote area not easily reached and therefore rarely visited, but for those who make the journey little has changed in 132 years. A lunar landscape added to the ferocious heat and stinging wind make for a hostile environment, walking on the ironstone surface makes matters even jollier as electric shocks are created with virtually anything subsequently touched. It really doesn’t take much imagination to picture the fierce fighting which took place there under such harsh conditions. Graves of British soldiers dot the surrounding area; they are marked with stones and their bones are, according to local tribesmen, occasionally uncovered due to the relentless wind. Those same locals appear to treat the site with a wary respect and claim the place is visited by spirits of the dead. If there was one truly haunted place on Earth then surely there could not be many better contenders than this. The only practical way to reach Abu Klea is with the help of local people, it is mostly off-road driving across the Bayuda desert and involves at least a one night stay in a local village, there is no village close to the site itself. Travel Agents in Khartoum are willing to arrange the trip for a reasonable sum, including an overnight village stay. Be prepared for most of the village residents deciding to come along for the ride as “advisors”!"
64,Goz Abu Goma Bridge,"Kosti, Sudan",One of the largest early 20th-century bridges in Sudan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/goz-abu-goma-bridge,"Stretching across the White Nile in southern Sudan, near the city of Kosti, the Goz Abu Goma Bridge is almost exactly a third of a mile long. Walkways line both sides of the railroad tracks that traverse the teal, truss bridge, which is the largest of its kind in Sudan. The Goz Abu Goma Bridge is a swing bridge, which can open at its center like a door, allowing large boat traffic to safely pass by on the White Nile below. When it was in operation, the railway linked Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, to southern cities like El Obeid. However, the southern parts of the railroad have been little used since the South Sudan Civil War broke out in 2013. The Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company, a company based in Darlington, England, built the bridge between 1909 and 1910. It was one of the most ambitious building projects the company took on in the early 20th century. The far-reaching Cleveland Company built bridges across the world in many countries either part of the British empire or where England held significant sway. Before 1925, the company constructed bridges in Shanghai, Zimbabwe, New Zealand, and the Isle of Man. The Sudanese Goz Abu Goma Bridge was the last they completed before World War I enveloped the globe. The British colonial administration of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan had commissioned the massive bridge, which stretched 500 feet longer than any other bridge the company had previously built.  The bridge is best seen from either side of the White Nile. Please get permission before attempting to cross the bridge."
65,Lake Natron,"Monduli, Tanzania",A salty red wasteland in Tanzania is a breeding spot for endangered flamingos.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-natron,"Don’t let the ring of salty marshes along the edge of Lake Natron fool you. This body of water is one of the most inhospitable areas on Earth. Colored a deep red from salt-loving organisms and algae, the lake reaches hellish temperatures and is nearly as basic as ammonia. Although most human settlements throughout history have formed around lakes and rivers, the barren landscape around Lake Natron tells a clear story of a place no one ever wanted to live. Africa’s Great Rift Valley is known for some of its environmentally extreme regions such as the Erta Ale and Dallol. The saline environment of Lake Natron certainly qualifies. Water is supposed to give life, yet this salty world seems content to make life almost impossible… almost. Although most species cannot handle the 120-degree lake water, cyanobacteria have made Natron their home and turned the lake its trademark reds and oranges. This algae growth has also fostered the developments of Lesser Flamingo nests. Amazingly, 2.5 million flamingos make Lake Natron their home and it is considered one of their only breeding grounds, making preservation of the lake an environmental concern. In fact, bringing in fresh water would greatly upset the ecological balance of the lake and many in Tanzania have actively fought against bringing in water from the Ewaso Ng’iro River. If the salinity of the lake decreases, the cyanobacteria will also decrease and cause a loss of habitat for the endangered flamingos. Besides losing a bird habitat, the world would also lose a beautiful and salty natural wonder if too much water is diverted south to Natron."
66,The Rock,"Michamvi, Tanzania","Sitting atop a rock on Michamvi Pingwe beach, this restaurant becomes its own island at high tide.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-rock-zanzibar,"Once the site of a fisherman’s post, The Rock restaurant sits perched atop a rock off the eastern coast of Unguja Island in the Zanzibar archipelago. The establishment is on what’s known as a “tidal island”—it rises above the sand on Michamvi Pingwe beach at low tide, but becomes an island at high tide. Depending on the time of day, voyagers arrive on foot or by boat. After climbing a wooden staircase to reach the entrance, diners enjoy unobstructed views of the Indian Ocean from one of 12 cozy tables beneath a Makuti palm tree roof. Patrons sip cocktails out on the back patio, which—at certain hours—is surrounded by turquoise water on three sides. The restaurant serves both lunch and dinner, so parties can time their meal reservations to match the desired tide level. The menu, which is largely European-inspired, highlights local seafood and house-made pasta. The Rock’s chefs offer guests a selection of globally-recognizable options, but they also aim to impart the flavors of Zanzibar and the surrounding region in every dish. The fish carpaccio is served with coconut, lime, and chili pepper. Most desserts (which range from chocolate salami to pineapple flambé) come topped with “Zanzibar spices” ice cream. Their beef, spices, and vegetables are all farmed nearby. While dining at The Rock is exponentially more expensive than dining elsewhere in Zanzibar, the restaurant, which opened in 2010, sponsors the Kichanga Foundation. Established in 2005, this organization teaches community members how to swim and focuses on a number of sustainability programs, including waste sorting and recycling.  The Rock offers two lunch seatings (at noon or 2pm), and two dinner seatings (at 4pm or 6pm), both by reservation only."
67,Kilwa Kisiwani Ruins,"Kilwa Masoko, Tanzania",Stunning ruins of what was once the center of one of the greatest empires in East Africa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kilwa-kisiwani-ruins,"Situated off the coast of Tanzania, the island of Kilwa Kisiwani (“isle of the fish”) was once the center of one of the greatest empires in East Africa. From the 9th century all the way up until the 19th century, Kilwa Kisiwani was a wealthy and powerful port, reaching its peak around the late-Middle Ages. At its height, the empire stretched from Kenya to Mozambique, and Kilwa Kisiwani’s prosperity was crucial to the development of Swahili civilization. During this time great structures were built that are now stunning ruins, all that’s left of the late empire. One of the most impressive of the ruins is the Great Mosque, the oldest standing mosque on the East African coast, which has 16 domes supported by many arches and pillars. Another amazing site is the Palace of Husuni Kubwa, which overlooks the island from on high and was once the largest building in sub-Saharan Africa. According to legend, the empire was established on the island by a Persian prince who bought Kilwa Kisiwani from an indigenous king for enough cloth to circle the island. The prince then destroyed a bridge that connected the island to mainland Tanzania. Kilwa Kisiwani grew rich and powerful because it was well placed on trading routes between Africa, China, India, and Arabia. Gold, porcelain, quartz, ivory, and other valuable treasures all passed through the island. Among the island’s own exports were spices, tortoiseshell, and slaves.  The start of its decline came in the 16th century, when the Portuguese completed their own fort on the island and came to dominate trade in the region.   You have to register for a permit to visit the island at the local antiquities office, it's simple admin, no one had visited for 2 weeks when we arrived. You must take a local dhow (traditional sail boat) out to the island"
68,Zanzibar's Night Market,"Zanzibar, Tanzania",After sunset the heart of Zanzibar's historic Stone Town neighborhood transforms into a culinary playground.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zanzibars-night-market,"By day, life around Zanzibar’s Forodhani Gardens moves at a leisurely pace: tourists and locals stroll down the seawalk, either sidestepping the eager advances of the city’s ravenous stray cats and taking in the views of an impossibly crystalline Indian Ocean. On the outskirts of Zanzibar’s historical Stone Town, this small park awaits the lucky travelers that manage to navigate their way through the heart of this historical neighborhood’s labyrinth of narrow streets. After sunset, this quiet corner of Stone Town is almost unrecognizable. The once calm Seawalk is rapidly filled with chefs, clad in white hats, setting up gas lamps, grills and rotisseries, spreading out their wares across rows of tables. The Night Market is a culinary playground for all—visitors and locals pour in, families gather with small children, and of course, the tenacious stray cats hunker down and wait for scraps. The chefs are a blur of motion, excitedly pointing to their culinary creations, cooing and coaxing until even the most hesitant eater gives in to their expertly spun sales pitches. The Night Market perhaps best represents Zanzibar’s wonderful amalgamation of cultures and cuisines. Zanzibar was once a trading center, at the intersection of the spice trade, the slave trade and the ivory trade. Arab, Persian, Indonesian, Malaysian, Indian, and Chinese merchants passed through or migrated to the island, leaving a lasting impact on Swahili culture. The vestiges of Zanzibar’s often tragic history linger in many ways; most noticeably in the unique blend of cultures on the Market’s signature white cardboard plates. Dishes vary widely, from Zanzibari pizza, falafel as big as your face, sugar cane juice, enormous samosas, coconut bread, seafood skewers (although debate persists pertaining to the actual freshness of the market’s pescetarian offerings), and crepes dripping with ribbons of chocolate syrup. For the culinary curious and history buffs alike, Stone Town is a magical little corner of Zanzibar, and the Night Market offers a glimpse at an expansive (and appetizing) history and culture—even if it means fighting with a covetous cat over that last morsel of crepe.  Make sure you bring Tanzanian shillings with you and be prepared to barter if you want to avoid overpaying for your culinary exploration. The Old Fort and the House of Wonders are adjacent to Forodhani Gardens and may provide a nice pre-sunset excursion while you wait for the Night Market to open."
69,The Underwater Room at Manta Resort,Tanzania,Stay in your own little bubble.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-underwater-room-at-the-manta-resort-tanzania,"The Underwater Room appears to float, buoy-like, upon the surface of the crystalline waters off the coast of Tanzania. In reality each corner is tethered to the ocean floor, so have no fear about floating adrift at sea. Guests are anchored in place, but they have submarine views of the ocean life around them. A little wooden structure, serenely set atop the turquoise ocean waters. Guests can swim (obviously), sunbathe and stargaze on the suite’s deck; pristine views of the Milky Way are visible due to Pemba’s physical isolation. But of course the Underwater Room’s real appeal lies, well, underwater. Beneath the wooden deck is a cozy bedroom containing just one neat little bed, but beyond the windows on all four sides is the blue wonderland of the Indian Ocean. Entire schools of fish eddy past, and curious angelfish may peer in to see what you’re up to."
70,Kuza Cave,"Kusini, Tanzania","This sacred, circular cave is lined with pools so clear and still that it's hard to tell where the water begins.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kuza-cave,"Remarkably pristine pools, some more than eight feet deep, line the cave’s perimeter. The stillness of the water reflects a backdrop of stalagmites and stalactites, making it difficult to discern where the water ends and the cave wall begins. Once the eye has adjusted, it’s possible to spot several openings that lead deeper underground. To date, these subterranean portals have yet to be explored. Kuza Cave is a geological formation with a long, fascinating history. The Jambiani area, where the cave is located, was and still is characterized by countless underground rivers that snake beneath a relatively flat landscape. Some 250,000 years ago, the constant erosion of these underground rivers flowing between two hard layers of limestone caused the upper layer to weaken and buckle. From this collapse, Kuza Cave was born. The new access to the revealed river created an easily accessible source of fresh water, which attracted animals and humans alike. Bones found strewn about the cave and surrounding area prove that giraffes, zebras, and waterbuck frequented it. And the marks on the bones, inflicted by sharp tools, indicate humans were present, too. The cave has long been a sacred space for the local people. For thousands of years, they’ve journeyed to this spot within the Earth’s underbelly to hold ceremonies and pray. It’s still a place of religious worship, and is closed to the public when ceremonies are in progress. When the cave is open (which it usually is), it offers a surreal, peaceful glimpse into a wondrous underground world. Kuza Cave has been the site of ancestor worship for thousands of years. It is, therefore, possible that access to it may be restricted due to a ceremony that’s only open to locals. However, these ceremonies are rare. On a regular basis, visitors can report to the Kuza Cave Culture Centre, which will provide a guide to the cave and a short but informative lecture on the cave. Half of the proceeds fund educational programs in the village."
71,Ol Doinyo Lengai,"Ngorongoro, Tanzania",This rare volcano spews the strangest and (literally) coolest lava in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ol-doinyo-lengai,"Along the East Africa Ridge in Tanzania emerges a volcano known as Ol Doinyo Lengai, translating from Maasai to “Mountain of God.” Such a name would signify a volcano of immense power, but the defining feature of Ol Doinyo Lengai is something else entirely. The Tanzanian volcano, sprouting over 10,000 feet tall in the middle of a plain, is the only active volcano on Earth spewing carbonatite lava instead of silica, a rare chemical makeup that yields some bizarre results. The lava that flows from Ol Doinyo Lengai is uniquely cool: At “only” up to 950 degrees Fahrenheit, it is nearly twice as cold as silicate magma. This relatively cool temperature colors the lava black and grey in daylight, instead of glowing the quintessential red (except sometimes at night). When the lava is hardened, it solidifies as a unique shade of white. And since the magma can cool and harden in seconds once it makes contact with this atmosphere, it sometimes shatters in mid-air and sprinkles down the slopes. Unlike the silicate magma of most volcanoes, composed mainly of silica and oxygen, the carbonatite lava emitted by Ol Doinyo Lengai contains alkali elements such as calcium, sodium, and potassium (this lava is so sodium rich that it’s a “natrocarbonatite”). Aside from the unique temperature and color this yields, the lava emitted by Ol Doinyo Lengai is also known to be the least viscous and most “runny” in the world. The lava is not just spouted from the main crater either; little peaks on the volcano’s surface called “hornitos” spew the wacky stuff as well. For all these reasons, the volcano is a favorite among scientists, as it’s easier to study than its dangerously hot counterparts—in fact, it’s sometimes called a “toy volcano.” It’s so relatively safe that reportedly a hiker once fell into the volcano once, and while burned, managed to survive."
72,Selous Game Preserve,"Liwale, Tanzania",The largest game reserve in Africa is home to thousands of species but refuses to house humans.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/selous-game-preserve,"Watching a lioness devour her fresh kill in the Selous Game Preserve has a tendency to remind visitors in their open air trucks that the nearest village is two days drive in any direction. Officially established as a protected area in 1896 when Tanzania was still a British colony, the Selous Game Preserve is located in the south of Tanzania, and is comprised of over 21,000 square miles of remote swamps, hills and grasslands. Unlike a lot of the more touristy safari spots on the Serengeti where competing guides jockey for position, the Selous Preserve feels incredibly remote thanks to the provision that prohibits any permanent habitation within the preserve’s boundaries. It’s possible to book a tour on this sprawling grassland and not see another soul the entire time. The Selous area is home to a staggering number of wildlife species, so much so that the location was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unspoiled beauty. The area has populations of vultures, crocodiles, lions, cape buffalo, hippos, and literally thousands of other species of plants and animals, all virtually undisturbed by human interaction. Hyenas stalk and kill their prey. Elephants lazily graze in the sun. Even rhinos can be found on the grounds, although sightings are rare, a sad testament to that animals’ continuing endangered status. The park also contains the gravesite of its namesake Frederick Selous, the British explorer and conservationist who was killed battling with German troops in the area during World War I. Selous knew the beauty and tranquility of this remote corner of the country, and thanks to his effort and foresight visitors to the preserve can continue to experience that beauty for themselves."
73,Mercury House,"Zanzibar, Tanzania",Freddie Mercury's childhood home is now a monument to the iconic Queen rockstar.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mercury-house,"While walking around the island of Zanzibar, you’ll come across an unexpected place: a monument to Freddie Mercury, the famous vocalist and songwriter for the rock band Queen. On a small road in Stone Town, the historic center of Zanzibar, stands what’s dubbed the Mercury House. Mercury spent parts of his childhood within this house. He was born in Zanzibar, as his parents were living there so that his father, Bomi Bulsara, could continue working with the British Colonial Office as a cashier. Although some dispute the history, many historians believe that as a child, Mercury spent his holidays at this home in Zanzibar and his school years attending class in India. When living in Stone Town, Mercury and his parents would regularly attend the nearby Zoroastrian temple. Although Mercury returned to Zanzibar at age 18 to live with his parents, he fled to England the next year to escape the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution, which overthrew the Sultan and killed thousands of Arabs and Indians. There, he would form Queen and spend the rest of his years. The facade of the house features a small monument with pictures of Mercury throughout his childhood and life.  The Mercury House is located on Kenyatta Road in the heart of Stone Town, Zanzibar."
74,Laetoli Footprints,"Ngorongoro, Tanzania",Human ancestor’s 3.6 million year-old footprints.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laetoli-footprints,"Roughly 3.6 millions years ago the Sadiman Volcano erupted covering the surrounding ground in ash; rain soon followed making a soft and muddy ground over which prehistoric animals trekked. More ash then erupted from the volcano covering and, in effect, preserving the prehistoric tracks. Forward to 1978, when a group of researchers (led by paleoanthropologist Mary Leakey) discovered the preserved tracks, within which were the oldest known footprints of human ancestors. From the prehistoric footprint’s shape, length, and toes it was evident that these hominids were bipedal and were walking upright on two legs, before even the use of stone tools. The prints were left by two or three hominids (one or two adults and a child) and show that these early humans walked in a very similar manner as modern humans. Today, the actual footprints have been covered up in hopes of protecting them, but due to fear of erosion they are planned to be uncovered again. Whether the prints remain at their discovered location (with a possible museum built over them) or are to be cut-out and moved entirely is currently under debate. For now visitors can visit the covered up site of discovery and the nearby Olduvai Gorge Museum, which features casts of the prints and related artifacts."
75,Shifting Sand Dunes,"Ngorongoro, Tanzania",These strange piles of magnetized volcanic ash travel across the desert about 50 feet per year.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shifting-sand-dunes-olduvai-gorge,"Lost in a nondescript part of the savannah, near the Olduvai Gorge on the road to the Serengeti, are two crescent-shaped sand dunes. The sand is remarkably dark, especially in comparison with the soil surrounding the dunes. This is because it is highly magnetized volcanic ash, which explains why the particles tend to falls back on the dunes instead of being blown away by the wind. In fact, it is possible to throw a handful of sand in the air and see how it clamps together and re-joins the dunes.  However, when strong winds blow, these sand dunes, also known as barkan, begin to move. Slowly but surely, they travel through the desert, at an average of 55 feet (17 meters) a year. It’s estimated that these shifting sand dunes have been wandering the savannah for 3 million years. Although this phenomenon is rare, it is not completely unique, and its origins have been ascertained. If volcanic ash is rich in iron, it can become magnetized, and when it is blown by the winds, it may start collecting around a rock. Given a sufficient amount of time, this little mound can become a dune. The local Maasai people believe the shifting sand dunes have come from the nearby sacred mountain Ol Doinyo Lengai, loosely translated as the Mountain of God (where God resides). As a consequence, these dunes are also considered sacred by the Maasai, who convene by the dunes in cases of prolonged draught. On these occasions, a goat is sacrificed to the gods so that rain may come soon. Understandably, climbing the sand dunes is inappropriate.  The dunes are located near Olduvai Gorge within Ngorongoro Conservation Area, along the road to Serengeti National Park.The trails leading to the area where the shifting sand dunes roam require a 4x4 vehicle in the dry season, and visiting the dunes shortly after a rainfall is not recommended, as the trails can turn into impassable mud pits."
76,Shop #47 at Mwenge Woodcarvers Market,"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania",An exquisite and eclectic selection of African masks stands out within a massive woodcarving marketplace.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shop-47-at-mwenge-woodcarvers-market,"Seen from the main road, Mwenge Woodcarvers Market could hardly be more nondescript, but enter through the opening in the center and you’ll find yourself standing in the middle of around 100 stores displaying a wide array of wonderful woodwork. Most of the woodcarvings in the stores are neatly polished and displayed in orderly fashion. You can find most imaginative reinventions of everyday objects, various ornaments that range in size from miniature figurines to life-size statues of humans and animals. One special feature of this market is that you can actually see the artists working on the sculptures. Shop #47 stands out at Mwenge Woodcarvers Market for its huge collection of ceremonial masks collected from all over Africa. The shopkeeper can provide information regarding the masks’ countries of origin, approximate age, and use. As the masks come from different regions of Africa, they were carved out of different kinds of wood, which is evident in the rainbow of grains and colors. Most masks are colorfully painted—red, black, orange, brown, and white are the most common—and some are adorned with ornamental items including seashells, metal, pottery, horns, teeth, straw, fabric, and hair. The quality and complexity of the mask reflects the importance of the ritual it was used in. In religious rituals, masks can symbolize a specific spiritual being, and as a rule of thumb, the more important the divinity, the more elaborate the mask. While some masks resemble an abstract version of a human face, others portray animals’ muzzles with different degrees of anthropomorphism. In the latter case, the mask wearer inhabits the intermediate world between human and animal, and as such he or she can communicate with both. A legitimate question to ask is whether these masks were produced for the market or for ceremonies. This is a question that not even the most expert in the field can answer with certainty, especially if considering that a woodcarver may well produce a number of masks with comparable quality and artistry, some of which may find their way to the market, while others may be selected for specific rituals."
77,The House of Wonders,"Zanzibar, Tanzania","In Zanzibar, a historic 19th-century palace is a reminder of the world's shortest war.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-wonders,"In the center of Stone Town, the most historic part of Zanzibar City, is a 19th-century palace that was part of the shortest war in history. The House of Wonders was constructed in 1883 by Barghash bin Said, the second Sultan of Zanzibar, as a ceremonial palace. Barghash made the door extra wide so he could enter the house on the back of an elephant, and the building’s large pillars and two-story clock tower were covered in white paint. From the get-go, the house was adorned with electricity and a working elevator, the first in all of East Africa to do so. The House of Wonders was thriving until 1896 when Khalid bin Barghash seized the throne after his cousin—the ruling Sultan at the time—passed away. This angered British forces in the area, who launched a naval bombardment of Stone Town for just 38 minutes in what’s known as the shortest war in world history. Although the attack damaged the House of Wonders, the building’s upper floor was still used as the home of the succeeding Sultan (who was sympathetic to the British). The brilliant white palace was used as a government facility for decades until 1990, when it became abandoned and began to crumble. Fortunately, due to the building’s fantastic history and cultural significance, large efforts were made to preserve it and turn it into a museum. The House of Wonders is now open to the public, allowing visitors to walk through the corridors and rooms of the house and see a 56-foot mtepe ship, bronze cannons from the 1500s, and track from the now-defunct Zanzibar Railroad. The museum displays the blend of Portuguese, English, Omani, and Swahili culture that can be found in Zanzibar through its traditional Swahili garments, David Livingstone’s medical chest, and carved wooden doors inscribed with phrases from the Quran. The House of Wonders proves that beyond Zanzibar’s white sand beaches rests a fascinating history and culture. Update as of January 2021: It appears the building has collapsed.  As of August 2018, the House of Wonders is under renovation. You can see the exterior by venturing to the center of Stone Town and finding the corner of Sokoku Street and Mizingani Street, next to the Old Fort, and you can visit the interior once it reopens."
78,Tippu Tip's House,"Zanzibar, Tanzania",This slowly crumbling mansion was home to one of East Africa's richest and most powerful slave traders.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tippu-tips-house,"Stroll down Suicide Alley south from Kelele Square and you’ll pass a short flight of marble steps leading up to a heavy wooden door, its elaborate but weathered carvings hinting at the home’s former glory. This was the residence of Tippu Tip, a slave trader, ivory merchant, and plantation owner who was once a mighty figure in Zanzibar and a force to be reckoned with on the African continent. The story of Tippu Tip, whose real name was Hamad bin Muhammad bin Juma bin Rajab el Murjebi, is straight out of the adventure books of old. Born in 1832 to a family of some standing, he left for Central Africa at an early age in search of ivory and enslaved people. His quest was fruitful, and he returned to Zanzibar with the spoils of his plundering. Tippu Tip then went on to build himself a vast trading empire, his ruthlessness and financial acumen turning him into one of the region’s leading merchants. Along the way, he encountered explorers such as David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley. He claimed the Eastern Congo for the Sultan of Zanzibar, and was made governor of the Stanley Falls District in the Congo Free State. He led troops in the Congo Arab War, and all the while maintained control of his extensive assets. By his mid-50s, Tippu Tip realized that the growing European influence in Africa was changing the trading dynamic on the continent. His influence in the Congo was also diminishing rapidly with the rise of Belgian colonization. After carefully considering his options, he returned to Zanzibar where he used his fortune to develop seven valuable clove plantations, and to manage his enslaved workers, who now numbered close to 10,000. Back in Zanzibar, Tippu Tip had a mansion built in the historic Stone Town area of the city. With its elegant balconies and carved wooden fittings, the large townhouse was befitting of the status of a man like Tippu Tip, who retired here as a wealthy and highly respected upper-class gentleman of Swahili society. After his death in 1905, the house remained a private residence until the Zanzibar Revolution in 1964. Then began its slow decline. It was converted into a block of flats, and is now occupied by various families of modest means. Today, its arched doorways are crisscrossed with laundry lines, its wide wooden stairways rickety and close to collapse, and the once elegant carved wooden screens stand chipped and peeling in the rays of the Zanzibar sun.  Tippu Tip's house is not officially open to the public. Intrigued visitors often pass by the front door and may get a glimpse of the courtyard within. If you're lucky, however, residents of the building might invite you in for an informal tour. A tip is appreciated and typically expected."
79,Slave Market Memorial,"Zanzibar, Tanzania",This monument is a stark reminder of the horrors of the Zanzibar slave trade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/slave-market-memorial,"In 1873 the world’s last open slave market closed. The last vestige of this horrific institution was located in Stone Town, Zanzibar. Enslaved people were transported to Zanzibar via overcrowded dhows. With little food, rampant disease, and appalling conditions, not all of the captives survived long enough to reach Zanzibar. Those who didn’t were thrown overboard. For those that did make it, another ordeal awaited, as they were sold at this site and then were likely shipped off to various Arab countries. Zanzibar was home to one of the largest slave markets in the world.  Although the slave trade took place all over the island, three major markets saw the bulk of these inhumane transactions. The market in Stone Town was infamous for being the most brutal. The pit and the Slave Market Memorial is in the same location where enslaved people were gathered to be brought and sold.  This memorial was created in 1998 by Clara Sornas of Scandinavia. On one side of the memorial is a mansion housing the slave cellar, one of fifteen low-ceiling chambers. Dim, suffocating, and with no toilets, these chambers were crammed with enslaved people, where they awaited the auction block. Captives were summoned to the yard and marched to the pit. There, they would be inspected by potential buyers. On the other side of the memorial is an Anglican church, from which you can see a mosque. A circle of white stones at the altar marks the place where the whipping post once stood  The value of enslaved people on Zanzibar was often based on how much pain they could endure at this post. An outer circle of red stones represents the bloodshed that took place. Unveiled in 1998, the Slave Market Memorial is a reminder of the sordid history of this island."
80,Engaruka Ruins,"Monduli, Tanzania",The culture that built these Tanzanian ruins displayed advanced knowledge of irrigation technology before mysteriously disappearing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/engaruka-ruins,"The history of Africa, and the Rift Valley in particular, is not a static one. Throughout history, the movement of different groups of people - hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, agriculturalists - have created one of the most unique and complex landscapes on the planet. The archaeological remains of this part of the world thus remain enigmatic, with few links between the people who created them and those who inhabit the area in the present day. So it is with the Engaruka ruins, which today overlook a dusty arm of the Rift Valley in north-western Tanzania. The story, as told by the archaeology, is vague. Sometime in the 15th century, locals began experimenting with the small-scale cultivation of indigenous African crops such as millet and sorghum. Over the next three centuries, however, their success in these small-scale endeavors led to a vast expansion in the farming system and a significant increase in population. A huge amount of labour was invested over this time in building furrows to canalize the Engaruka River and redistribute water to the fields, which sprawled at the foot of the Rift escarpment. Large terraces were constructed, repaired, and reconstructed such that over time, they reached a cumulative height of over 3 meters in places. On the slopes overlooking these fields, villages expanded to incorporate a burgeoning population, which at its height may have included over 8000 men, women, and children. Visiting the site today, its location does nothing to betray its prominent history. What once may have been one of the biggest inland centers in eastern Africa is now a quiet corner of Tanzania, on the edge of the much more popular and touristic Ngorogoro Conservation Area. The road to get here is long and unpaved. You must either catch the bus that runs twice a day from Mto wa Mbu on the shore of Lake Manyara, or else risk life and limb on a one-and-a-half-hour dirt bike (‘Piki-Piki’) ride through the bush. Either way, you are not likely to encounter any of the safari traffic of Ngorogoro, but instead the rush-hour gridlock of dozens of Maasai pastoralists herding their goats in the middle of the road. Once here, the climb up the Rift escarpment to the location of the village can be brutal in the midday 40°C heat. You may wonder, among the other unsolved mysteries of the site, why in God’s name the inhabitants of Engaruka chose to build on a slope like this. Then, looking back over the abandoned field system stretched out below, you may begin to realize what a huge project the building of this site was, and what a significant place it must have been. Tally this with how little is known about the site, and the questions multiply. For all its “natural” wonders, the human agency that created the landscape of eastern Africa is often overlooked. In fact, much of what is considered ‘natural’ about the east Africa landscape is the product of thousands of years of human interaction with and within the environment. The Serengeti plains, for instance, are a carefully managed anthropogenic landscape that has been shaped through the sustained grazing of pastoralist herds for the past two thousand years. This makes Engaruka even more important as a site: for standing out as a testament to the rich human history of an area of the world whose human history is often forgotten. Sometime in the 18th century, the villages of Engaruka were abandoned and the fields at the foot of the Rift escarpment ceased to be cultivated. On par with the rest of what is known about the site, the reasons for this sudden desertion are unexplained. Nowadays, locals at the modern village of Engaruka, about four kilometers from the ancient site, have their own theories about who lived here 500 years ago, while archaeologists return again and again with ever more elaborate equipment to answer ever more elaborate questions. The answers to these questions, however, will necessarily rely in part on mere speculation. Local buses run twice a day in the afternoon from Mto wa Mbu to Engaruka, journey time about 1.5 hours. Alternatively, local motorbike taxis ('Piki-Pikis') can be hired to make journeys out to Engaruka village."
81,Akodessewa Fetish Market,"Lome, Togo",The Voodoo Superstore of the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/akodessewa-fetish-market,"Deep in the heart of West Africa, Vodou (Togo); Vodoun (Benin), or more familiarly, Voodoo (Haiti) is not only alive and well, but it is thriving. Togo’s capital city of Lomé is the birthplace of the largest Voodoo market in the world – a kind of super supply store for fetishes, charms and anything else one might need for a ritual. The Akodessewa Fetish Market, or Marche des Feticheurs, is a place where you can find anything from leopard heads and human skulls to Vodou (voodoo) priests who bless and create fetishes or predict the future and make medicines to heal whatever ails you. Though many people think of Haiti as Voodoo’s biggest stronghold, the religion originated in West Africa. Vodoun is the official religion of neighboring Benin and is still the largest religion in the area, which is obvious given that the outdoor market’s location is in the heart of Togo’s capital. Although the market is owned and run by Beninese. The Akodessewa Fetish Market is a mecca to local practitioners and they travel there from all over the African continent.  Many believers view the Marche des Feticheurs as a kind of hospital or pharmacy – it is the place you go when you either cannot afford traditional treatment or traditional treatment has failed you. Here you can find talismans and charms good for treating everything from the flu or infertility to removing the blackest of curses. In the practice of Voodoo every single creature is potent and divine, whether alive or dead, and in the Akodessewa Fetish Market you may find them all – monkeys, alligators, goats, leopards, gazelles, and many, many more – in various stages of decay and stacked up in macabre piles for blocks. The outdoor location doesn’t quite suppress the stench but at least the huge market is in the open air. It is a jarring place for tourists who are not used to the idea of animal sacrifice as part of worship or using pieces of the dead as talismans, but for locals who practice the religion, it is a treasure and a necessity. Open 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Four kilometres from the centre, it can be accessed by taxi or taxi-moto. There is a fee for taking photos."
82,Nok Caves,"Tandjouare, Togo",Hidden dwellings in the cliffsides of North Togo used by local Moba tribes to evade 18th-century slave traders.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nok-caves,"The Moba people in north Togo lived off the land in the Savanes region. During the 18th and 19th centuries, a neighboring ethnic group, the Tchokossi, would attack the Moba and kidnap their people to trade to European slave traders for guns and horses. The Moba took to the precarious cliffs of the area to build defensive dwellings hidden in the red rocks. Lookouts would use fire signals or the sound of cow horns to alert others that the Tchokossi were coming. They would then climb down overhanging vines to caves hidden beneath the cliffs. Within the cracks of the rock face, a mini fortress grew from large cylindrical structures filled with handmade clay jars to store grains and livestock. Nearby, springs brought water that was treated with local plants, making it possible to hide for days. The Moba used offensive tactics as well. Young warriors would attack with arrows poisoned from the same local plant used to treat the water. Legend holds that other warriors would lure the Tchokossi to their doom on the cliffs. As the Tchokossi chased the warriors on their horses, the warriors would run in the direction of the edge of the cliffs and quickly dive into nearby cracks in the rocks and the Tchokossi, unable to stop their horses quick enough, would fly right off the edge. Nok translated in Moba means “hidden” which still describes this incredible site where visitors can explore and interact with the rich, somewhat unknown history of the ethnic groups of northern Togo. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000, the Nok Caves still exist today accessible by a metal ladder constructed for tourists. The structures continue to extend right out of the narrow rocks. Though most of the area was looted, arrows and quivers can still be seen amongst the broken pottery. Over 150 jars are still intact which were used to store millet and sorghum. In the middle of the area is a long, angled rock where the leaders would sit to weave tales of the bravery of their people in evading slave traders. The caves can be accessed through the village Nagou where visitors can try the locally brewed alcoholic drink, Tchokpa. Though travelers can take a road to the plateau, it is also possible to climb up the rock face to achieve an intimate engagement with the landscape. The start of the trail is marked by a water tower near the village of Djabire at the base of the mountain."
83,Koutammakou,"Dissani, Togo",The unique building practices of the Batammariba reflect the community's deep reverence for and connection to the earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koutammakou-batammariba,"The traditional building practices of the Batammariba people are featured center stage at Koutammakou, a mountainous region bordering Togo and Benin that UNESCO calls “a living cultural landscape.” These earth-tower houses, called takienta, are a national symbol of Togo, and are steeped in a strong cultural identity once threatened by other ethnic groups. Batammariba roughly translates to “those who are the real architects of earth,” demonstrating how central the construction of these community dwellings has been to the Batammariba identity. Over the years, the takienta’s walls are reinforced by additional layers of mud and plaster, and when one is retired from use, its earthen core is incorporated into a new structure. Straw roofs usually top takienta structures, which are built to keep inhabitants and foodstuff cool under the hot Koutammakou sun. About eight takienta make up a collective sikien, a full home of dedicated structures. One takienta might be used as a kitchen, others as bedrooms, and still others as food and livestock storage. Ancestral spirits are said to inhabit these dwellings and protect their living descendants. Takienta are now mostly used for storage and worship purposes, but are still used as primary dwellings in some areas of Koutammakou. The Batammariba people have a rich animist religion that recognizes both family and tribal deities and shows great reverence to nature. These beliefs are also manifested in elements of takienta construction, like the requirement that a dwelling’s main door always face westward to represent the sunset of the winter solstice. The Batammariba people have been present in the Koutammakou region for hundreds of years, which was considered as one united area before colonial powers divided Togo and Benin through the mountains. The Togolese side is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but the Benin side has no official protection.  Visitors should plan to visit the Togolese side of the Koutammakou, and can arrange trips on their own or through tour companies. Budget 1,500 CFA per person, and 10,000 CFA for an UNESCO guide. Transport will vary on your departure and if you travel with a tour or solo, but a common route will take you to Kara from Lome, and onward to Koutammakou (a roundtrip taxi is 20,000 - 30,000 CFA for the day). Others elect to stay in tents overnight closer to the villages. You can buy souvenirs from Batammariba artisans, and should plan to visit the sacred community Baobab tree."
84,Leftover Star Wars Sets,"Tozeur, Tunisia",Buildings from the fictional planet of Tatooine still litter the Tunisian desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leftover-star-wars-sets,"While much of George Lucas’ mythic “Star Wars” films were filmed in studio lots or in preexisting structures, a number of their exterior sets, especially for the desert planet Tatooine, were purpose built for the films and simply abandoned to the sands and the fans when filming was over. While the most famous leftover Star Wars set may be the Hotel Sidi Driss, a Tunisian hotel which was used as the interior of the Lars moisture farm, Luke Skywalker’s teenage home, many more structures were built just for the production such as the Lars farm exterior and most of the city of Mos Espa. In Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace the spaceport of Mos Espa is shown as a bustling frontier town where young Anakin Skywalker lives and works as a slave. Many of the bulbous structures were filled in using CGI, but much of the first stories of the buildings were built practically and still stand as a squat beige town square that looks as though it was shaved cleanly off at the top. The facades are not actually buildings, but fronts built for filming, yet visitors can still mill about the exteriors as though they were on that far flung desert planet. There are also some iconic “moisture vaperators” also left on the site. The single-domed building that was built to represent the outside of the Lars Homestead where Luke Skywalker grew up, unaware of his cosmically significant heritage, was used originally in Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope, and then shot again for the prequel films. This little building was built in the middle of nowhere for the very first film in the series and was abandoned after shooting wrapped. Left to the elements, it deteriorated but was actually refurbished when the later prequels once again had use for it. After the prequels finished shooting the fake home was once again abandoned and began to fall apart again. However a group of dedicated fans have actually taken to restoring the hut so that it can last for future fans of the franchise. Unfortunately rampant desertification has threatened both the Mos Espa and Lars farm sets as the unstoppable desert sands are beginning to bury the science fiction meccas. The country of Tunisia has even recently sought international support to save the Mos Espa set which is a huge source of tourism revenue for the country."
85,Hotel Sidi Driss,"Matmatat-Al-Qadimal, Tunisia","The original film set of Luke Skywalker's Tatooine home from the ""Star Wars"" trilogy.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hotel-sidi-driss,"Hotel Sidi Driss should be on the map for every hardcore “Star Wars” fan. It is the place where many of the most memorable scenes of the saga were filmed, and fans will no doubt recognize Luke Skywalker’s childhood home on the planet of Tatooine. Of course, for anyone who grew up around the Sidi Driss hotel and Berber architecture, Tatooine looks less like an alien planet and more like the old neighborhood. The hotel is situated in village of Matmâta and the whole village itself is a prime example of traditional Berber architecture such as the adobe caverns dug into the sandstone. While the exact history of the settlement is unknown, local legend claims that they date back at least to the times of Punic wars in from 264 to 146 BC. The whole region was virtually unknown to the outsiders until 1967, when severe flooding prompted locals to seek out aid from central Tunisian government. It was only 10 years later that George Lucas selected Hotel Sidi Driss as one of the locations for filming his movie A New Hope. In following years the hotel fell back in relative obscurity, and most of the decorations used in the movie were removed by the owners. In 1995 a French Star Wars fan by the name of Philip Vanni restored the frescoes in one of the rooms. The Star Wars decorations were fully restored in 2000 for filming of Attack of the Clones, one of the prequels of the original trilogy. With the popularity that Star Wars universe now enjoys it is unlikely that movie decorations will be removed anytime soon. The hotel is open all year round and offers affordable accommodation. It can accommodate the maximum of 145 guests in 20 rooms, grouped in four separate caverns. The fifth pit is a hotel restaurant. Regular daytime service by louage (share taxi) or bus (8 daily) from Gabes (40 km). Specify Matmata Ancienne as some services terminate in Matmata Nouvelle 15 km distant. Daily service to Tunis (450 km) via Sfax and Sousse."
86,Lars Homestead,"Nefta, Tunisia","The original movie set for the home of ""Star Wars"" hero Luke Skywalker.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lars-homestead,"Lars Homestead is one in a series of Tunisian relics from a galaxy far, far away. The unassuming structure is the original movie-set for the home of hero Luke Skywalker, the main protagonist in both the original Star Wars movie trilogy and later episodes of the popular series. Located just outside the town of Naftah (Nefta) in the Eastern part of the country, the small dome represents the entrance to a below-ground-level home. First constructed in 1976 when the film crew for Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope arrived in Tunisia, after serving its purpose Lars Homestead was left to decay in the middle of the desert. Just like the Star Wars movies, the saga of Lars Homestead seems to never end. In the year 2000, after decades of abandonment, the iconic home was reconstructed for the latest installment of series, Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones. After filming concluded, once again the homestead was left to the whims of this unforgiving environment. Several years later, the dome was given an unexpected new lease on life and sympathetically restored, this time by a dedicated group of international Star Wars movie enthusiasts. It’s incredible that a relatively flimsy film set from 1976 has lasted this long, especially here. After all, Lars Homestead was created to be a temporary set, and permanence was not part of the original design brief. However, although Lars Homestead may be extant, it continues to suffer from both the unrelenting Saharan climate, and due to the remote location, neglect. Unknown to many fans of the Star Wars series, the movie directors must plead guilty to deceiving the movie-goers. Most would naturally assume that both the entrance to Lars Homestead and the internal below-ground courtyard of the same house, are one structure. In reality, with the help of a little Hollywood magic, the inner courtyard of Lars Homestead was created and filmed around 160 miles away from this domed entrance, inside what is now the real-life Hotel Sidi Idris.  Lars Homestead is located in a fairly remote part of the world, in a pretty harsh environment, and it’s recommended to have a guide and/or a 4x4 vehicle. Exit the town of Naftah in the direction of Algerian border, head down the main road for about six miles (10 kilometers), and at some point of your choosing, you will need to travel off-road and into the desert (heading approximately southeast from the road). Just a little farther away, but not quite in another galaxy, is another must-see for both Star Wars buffs and Tunisia explorers in general: the abandoned space-port named Mos Espa. Bring plenty of water inside a sturdy four-wheel drive, head across the Sahara desert, and you’re there."

Rounded, protected structures built completely of cracked, dry mud face the center of the castle-like granary, while steep outdoor staircases give the area the appearance of another world entirely. Ksar Ouled Soltane looks so otherworldly, George Lucas choose Southern Tunisia for filming four of the six Star Wars films. Fans will undoubtably recognize Ksar Ouled as the slave quarters where Anakin and his mother lived in the Phantom Menace. Even more surprising for fans of Lucas’ films, is that the area of Tunisia is actually called Tataouine, styled as Tatooine for the films. Before Star Wars put Ksar Ouled Soltane on the tourist map in North Africa, the windswept buildings stood in relative isolation. Constructed by Berber people, the ghorfas, or stacked grain-holding buildings have survived the hot climate since the 15th century. Although they have now been abandoned for many years, the Ksar was built for protection from raids, and designed to remain cool during arid weather near the Sahara Desert. The entire complex can be toured and explored on a visit to Tataouine, and for the nerdier of visitor, complete Star Wars tours of Southern Tunisia are offered by many locals. Accessible from Tataouine by taxi"
88,Matmata Underground Houses,"Matmatat-Al-Qadimal, Tunisia","Made famous by ""Star Wars,"" these troglodyte homes face an uncertain future.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/matmata-underground-houses,"The Berber underground homes of Matmata lie in an arid, pockmarked landscape in the parched valleys of southern Tunisia’s Djebel Dahar region. Made famous by Star Wars, these traditional structures are now threatened as residents move away to live in towns and villages. Every Star Wars fan worth their salt knows a little about the location of Luke Skywalker’s house: not Tatooine, but the actual filming location in Tunisia. Or, to be more precise, the Hotel Sidi Driss in Matmata, chosen as the set for Luke’s family home thanks to its otherworldly underground construction. But the Hotel Sidi Driss isn’t the only underground building of its type. Similar structures dot the landscape around Matmata, a pitted land of palm trees and olive groves. It’s an open question as to when nomadic tribes decided to settle here in their underground houses, and the entire area was largely unknown to the outside world until the 1960s, when severe flooding brought it to the attention of the Tunisian government. The houses themselves are built by first digging a deep circular pit into the sandstone, which is soft enough to work with simple hand tools. Caves are then dug out around the edges of the pit, forming the underground rooms and leaving the main pit as a courtyard. Once finished, the troglodyte construction offers a fine escape from the heat of the day, and a sturdy home that could survive for many years. Unless, of course, heavy rains like those of the 1960s lead to flooding, damage and in some cases the destruction of the underground dwellings. Periods of extreme drought can also damage the homes. Since the last major flooding, and despite the tourism generated by Star Wars, another threat to the homes has arisen: rural depopulation. Locals had already begun moving out of their traditional homes during the 1960s and 1970s, when President Habib Bourguiba was trying to modernize the country and many Berbers moved to the towns. More have since left, slowly trickling away with the decline of tourism. Tunisia’s tourism industry has been struggling ever since the country’s 2011 Arab Spring uprising, and was further damaged following the 2015 attacks in Tunis and Sousse, which directly targeted tourists. Some locals have remained, however, living with their families in their underground households, working their olive farms and occasionally accepting tips from tourists who want a tour of their home. And today, only a handful of men still know how to dig and maintain these special Berber dwellings."
89,El Jem Amphitheatre,"El Jem, Tunisia","The largest and best-preserved Roman amphitheater in Africa was designed to seat 35,000 people.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-jem-amphitheatre,"The Amphitheatre of El Jem is one of the largest Roman amphitheaters ever built. Indeed (depending on how you measure it) El Jem may be considered to be the third-largest ever, after the Colosseum in Rome and the destroyed amphitheater in Capua. Designed to seat a whopping crowd of 35,000 people, today El Jem is both the largest and the best-preserved Roman amphitheater in Africa. Located in the city of El Jem (or El Djem), which was known back in Roman times as Thysdrus, El Jem Amphitheatre was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage in 1979. Hence, if you make it to the town of El Jem, you’re probably not going to miss this dramatic attraction. Although far from secret, the backstory of the construction, and the modern-day misconceptions of El Jem Ampitheatre, are little known. The precise construction date is debated, but most historians believe the building of El Jem Ampitheatre began in the year 238. Not exactly an auspicious year for the Roman Empire, 238 came to be known historically as the “Year of the Six Emperors.” In just one year, six different people were proclaimed Emperors of Rome. Locally, the year 238 was particularly tumultuous, as it included a revolt by the population of Thysdrus (El Jem), who opposed the enormous taxation amounts being levied by the Emperor Maximinius’s local procurator. As with all good taxation revolts, riots ensued, and the procurator was assassinated. However, even the assassination wasn’t enough to satisfy the locals, and they pleaded for a new ruler of the Roman Empire. Soon after the North African uprising, Goridan the First was appointed Emperor, along with Goridan the Second, his son, to co-serve as Roman leaders. Although their rule was brief—they only ruled for about 20 days—it was long enough to start the construction of the imposing amphitheater in El Jem. In more contemporary times, perhaps it’s the enormous size and uniqueness of the El Jem Amiptheatre that leads to many misattributions (on behalf of both movie fans and local guides). Some people say the Oscar-winning movie Gladiator was filmed here (it wasn’t, a fake “Colosseum” was built on the relatively nearby island nation of Malta). There are also many attributions to the Monty Python film Life of Brian being filmed at this location. But though Monty Python did film in Tunisia, they used the Roman theater in Carthage near the capital city of Tunis.  The El Jem Amphitheatre is located in the middle of the city of El Jem, and is difficult to miss. However, a nice approach is from the southeast corner, via Rue Ali Belhareth. Stop for a tea or coffee across the street, and marvel at the exterior before venturing inside."
90,Mos Espa,Tunisia,"An abandoned film set location for a remote spaceport in a galaxy far, far away hides in the Tunisian desert.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mos-espa-abandoned-star-wars-film-set,"Sitting in the sands that separate two salt lakes, the enormous Chott El Djerid and smaller Chott El Gharsa, Mos Espa is an abandoned film set created as the location of a remote spaceport in a galaxy far, far away. The surreal setting and dramatic otherworldly structures make Mos Espa a “must-see” if you’re a Star Wars fan. However, it’s a great visit even if you’re not a fan of the films. Being one of Star Wars’s major spaceports, Mos Epsa is shown in the movies as a town bustling with the daily life of different aliens from around the galaxy. Home to hero Anakin Skywalker from Episodes I, II, and III, we are told the location is on a remote planet known as Tatooine—named after the very real nearby Tunisian town, Tataouine. Here, Anakin and his mother live as slaves, and the foundations for all the vast storylines of the older Star Wars movies are laid. Although some of the Mos Espa townsite was added in post-production using CGI, here on the edge of the Sahara, all of the major buildings from the movies are extant. Tens of structures line the main city streets, including many “Moisture Vaporators”— in Star Wars, these devices were used to harvest atmospheric humidity and obtain much-treasured water. Currently, Mos Espa is being slowly engulfed by the sand that comes with each passing dust-storm. Over the years, the harsh Sahara climate, moving sand dunes, and a trickle of tourists have started to take their toll. Unlike the other more traditional Star Wars filming locations, Mos Espa town was built in the middle of nowhere. Although nothing here was designed for permanence, thanks to the work of enthusiasts both local and foreign, you can still walk the streets that Qui-Gon Jinn walked to meet Anakin.   Mos Espa's location is remote, and in the desert. Bring a substantial amount of water (especially during summer). The easiest way to Mos Espa is via the newly reconstructed road—leaving the town of Naftah northward, pick the road that goes slightly left, and head north all the way till you reach the end (Mos Espa will be right in front of you). There is another way, which is much more entertaining, but requires a knowledgeable guide and reliable 4x4 vehicle: go in a straight line from wherever you are, across the desert sands and dry salt-lake bed."
91,Tophet at Carthage,"Carthage, Tunisia",An ancient burial ground believed to have been used for ritual sacrifice.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tophet-at-carthage,"Tophets are at the center of one of the most contentious archaeological debates surrounding the region of northern Africa that was once part of the ancient Carthaginian Empire. The enigmatic ancient cemeteries are believed to have been used for the ritual sacrifice of children and animals. The burial site at Carthage in Tunisia, as well as others in the region, was discovered in the 20th century. It, along with the others, contained funerary urns stuffed with the cremated ashes and bone fragments of young children. Over 20,000 urns buried under stelae (stone slabs with inscriptions) were found at the tophet in Carthage, which is one of the largest cemeteries from the Phoenician period. These findings and subsequent research, which included referencing accounts in ancient texts, propelled the theory that infants were sacrificed and cremated as part of a ritual to give thanks for favors from deities, mainly the goddess Tanit and the god Baal. For many years, the rumors that the ancient Carthaginians had sacrificed their own young was considered to be propaganda spread by the Greeks and Romans, who disliked them and the wider Phoenician civilization. Over the decades, several groups of historians have debated the subject, but they have yet to reach a concrete answer. Most recently, a team led by an Oxford historian ruled there was strong evidence that ritual sacrifices did, in fact, take place. It wasn’t an isolated incident either—it happened over several centuries. Today, the tombstones and ritual altars form part of a historical site outside the capital city of Tunis, which was granted World Heritage status in 1979. The cemetery, a hybrid of a sanctuary and a necropolis, forms a striking picture. When it was at its largest, it was over 64,000 square feet and spanned nine different levels. The word “tophet” comes from a place described in Hebrew scripture, where people who were influenced by an ancient Canaanite religion burned and sacrificed children to their gods. It’s also another term for hell.  The Archeological site of Carthage is 1,600 feet (500 meters) from Carthage Salammbo Station."
92,Tunis Medina,"Tunis, Tunisia",The ancient heart of Tunis is an enormous maze of narrow streets and alleyways.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tunis-medina,"For over 1,300 years, Tunis Medina has remained bustling, but mostly unknown. Certainly, this is one of the busiest locations in the whole country. Every day, thousands of people go about their shopping, pray at one of the many mosques hidden deep within, and down strong shots of Tunisian espresso (or tiny cups of sugary mint tea). But, apart from a small handful of well-trodden lane-ways, the majority of the Tunis Medina remains mysterious and rarely visited by outsiders. Medina of Tunis (“medina” meaning “town” in Arabic) was founded during the seventh century around the site of enormous Al-Zaytuna Mosque. This is the second oldest mosque in Tunisia, constructed during the earliest days of Islam, and the Zaytuna Mosque defined the Medina area as an important cultural center, school, and university. Slowly, organically, over many centuries, the town around Zaytuna grew and expanded to become the Medina of Tunis. A UNESCO World Heritage site, and well-known due to the central location, to this day the Medina of Tunis remains genuinely a city-within-a-city. It’s not only a place for shopping and eating—it’s a neighborhood home for many residents. The internal Medina streets may be difficult to navigate, but having “outsiders” wandering through is part and parcel of living here. This is a neighborhood that’s used to living close to the action. You’re most likely to enter Tunis Medina by moving through the Place de la Victoire, an open square dotted with fountains, restaurants, cafes, and the Bab el Bhar gate (do check out the small “sea-level” marker on the side of the gate). Within moments, the “European” styled city ends abruptly, and you’re in another world filed narrow alleys, twisting, turning, and undulating, mostly covered but not always. During the day, Medina is truly a sight to behold. Thousands of shops line streets dedicated to selling specific items—jewelry street, wedding gifts street, woodworkers street, there’s even a covered alley with vendors specializing in making only chechias, burgundy-red cylindrical felt hats. In between, there’s restaurants, street-food, offices, apartments, a hotel or two, and countless paths you could take to see it all. As the sun sets, a new reality sets in. Every evening, like clockwork, most of the Medina is abandoned. It’s dark (there’s a near-total lack of lighting), and nearly impossible to navigate for anyone other than those most familiar with the layout. Most of the locals leave, or move to the wider open areas of Medina. The keen remainders catch up with friends, chat, drink coffee and tea, and smoke hookah before heading home and doing it all again the next day.  Tunis Medina is a can’t-miss place in both the literal and figurative sense. Sitting in the middle of the city, all visitors to Tunis are certain to come across the Medina soon enough. However, consider setting aside a few hours to truly explore one of the world’s oldest Medina’s. Move off the main drag, and wander through with no particular destination in mind. Indeed, it’s going to take time, and a little luck, to uncovering your unknown corner of this unique maze—but this is the true can't-miss side of the Tunis Medina. The location is given for Bab el Bhar, the ""sea gate"" that separates Tunis Medina and the European-styled central city. From there, it’s easy to spot the main entrance of the Medina—just walk on in. Keep in mind, it’s very difficult to navigate within the Median using GPS, due to the narrow and covered streets. For the best shopping and eating, visit before sunset."
93,Dougga,"Teboursouk, Tunisia",The best-preserved Roman small town in North Africa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dougga,"Some call it Dougga, some call it Thugga. Either way, its pristine preservation has earned it World Heritage Site status from the UNESCO. It sits on a craggy hillside, perched above fertile hills of groves in central Tunisia. Despite its status as a preserved Roman town, the settlement is actually quite a bit older than that: The discovery of dolmens (Bronze Age burial structures) within the city limits indicates a human presence since at least 2000 BCE. Though most of what remains of the city is from the Roman era, there are several significant Numidian structures, including the Punic-Libyan Mausoleum. It was during this time that the site was known as Thugga. The site owes its state of preservation to remoteness and lack of modern encroachment. Among its structures is a theater that could seat practically the entire population of the town—around 3,500. There is also a circus for chariot racing, a large villa, several baths dating from 300 CE, and two triumphal arches. The site contained a large number of elaborate mosaic floors. (Some are in situ but most are housed in the Bardo Museum in Tunis.) Most notable of all, however, are the twenty temples found, a truly disproportionate number of temples for the size of the population. At first it was thought that Dougga was a major religious site, but it has since been decided that the temples were erected by wealthy residents as tribute for their good fortune. The most famous and most photographed of these temples is the Capitol, built in the 2nd century CE. It’s dedicated to Rome’s protective triad: Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. The capitol is exceptionally well preserved, owing to its inclusion within a later Byzantine fortification. Visitors to the site can wander through the hilly, cobblestoned streets and take in the serene atmosphere. Aside from the major sites, there is an interesting group latrine (the more, the merrier!)."
94,Dar El Annabi,"Carthage, Tunisia",This museum in the famously blue neighborhood of Sidi Bou Saïd showcases a traditional Tunisian lifestyle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dar-el-annabi,"Approximately 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Tunis, the town of Sidi Bou Saïd sits atop a cliff overlooking Carthage and the Gulf of Tunis. A residential suburbs with about 6,000 inhabitants, it is a fairly popular tourist spot in Tunisia. But unlike other destinations like the Antonine Baths or the Medina, Sidi Bou Saïd’s main attraction lies not in its history or the lively Middle Eastern atmosphere, but simply in its gorgeous appearance. Many of the houses in Sidi Bou Saïd are adorned with blue-and-white walls and doors with Islamic decorative patterns. These residences, some of which date back to the 18th century, are nestled among Mediterranean cafes, market squares, narrow alleys, and flight after flight of steps. One of the elegant houses, Dar El Annabi, has been turned into a museum where visitors can see a slice of life in Sidi Bou Saïd. Dar El Annabi  was originally built near the end of the 18th century. In the 20th century, it was redeveloped as a summer resort for Taib El Annabi, son of Mufti Mohamed Annabi. It is now a museum showing the typical Islamic architecture on the outside and the atmosphere and lifestyle of a traditional Tunisian family on the inside. Visitors can go inside and explore the private library, prayer hall, lounges, bedrooms, the Andalusian garden, and terraces that offer a view of the surrounding terraces. Since the 19th century, Sidi Bou Saïd has attracted a number of artists, musicians, writers and philosophers, including Michel Foucault, Alphonse de Lamartine, François-René de Chateaubriand, Gustave Flaubert, Andre Gide, Simone de Beauvoir, Colette, and even the infamous occultist Aleister Crowley. The history of Sidi Bou Saïd goes back to the ancient times, when the Carthaginians and Romans used the cliff to establish a watchtower. The 11th-century Almoravids used the site for the same purpose, calling it Djebel al-Manar, or “the Mountain of Fire.” A couple of centuries later, the town welcomed Sunni saint Abu Said ibn Khalef ibn Yahia Al-Tamimi Al-Baji, more commonly Sidi Bou Saïd, who taught Sufism on a nearby hill. After his death, his name was given to the settlement.  There is an entrance fee to visit the museum. In addition to being a museum, Dar El Annabi can be rented for use as an event space."
95,Sidi Bouhlel,"Daqas, Tunisia",A seemingly simple canyon that was the backdrop to a number of famous movies.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sidi-bouhlel,"Sidi Bouhlel is a ravine near the town of Tozeur in Tunisia that would not even be remembered if it were not for all of the Star Wars scenes that were shot in its depths. The canyon takes its name from a nearby marabout (a shrine built to honor a holy man) of the same name, although it is more commonly known as the “Star Wars Canyon.” The shady divide acted as a number of locations in Star Wars: A New Hope during scenes on the desert planet of Tatooine. The kidnapping of R2-D2 and the rescue of Luke Skywalker by Obi-Wan Kenobi were all shot at the bottom of the stony ravine. In addition to Star Wars, the location was also featured in other films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark and The English Patient, but most of the visitors to the site are simply looking to make a pilgrimage to a galaxy far, far away.  From Tozeur, travel east towards Chott el Jerid. Right before you reach the chott, turn left (the sign says towards ""DGHOUMES""). Continue on this road for 2.1 km, and then left on a dirt road. The canyon is at the foot of Sidi Bouhlel, just 1.6 km down this road. Sidi Bouhlel is a well-known marabout in the area. Be sure to lock your car door when you park."
96,Hotel du Lac,"Tunis, Tunisia",Some believe this abandoned Brutalist masterpiece inspired George Lucas's Sandcrawler.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hotel-du-lac,"Envisaged and designed by the Italian architect Raffaele Contigiani, Hotel Du Lac was constructed between 1970 and 1973 for the Tunisian government during the middle of the reign of Habib Bourguiba, Tunisia’s first president. The structure is not only an icon of Tunis city, as it is well-known among lovers of Brutalist architecture around the world. With its sharp geometry and imposing inverted pyramid shape, the abandoned hotel dominates the ville nouvelle area of Tunis. A contemporary architectural icon of North Africa (with much more than a pinch of raw-concrete Brutalism), Hotel Du Lac is not just your usual 10-floor/416-room hotel. The mind-bending, uniquely cantilevered design results in a top floor that’s double the length of the ground floor. Fans of the Star Wars movie franchise will certainly find some familiarity with the silhouette of the hotel. Indeed, the first movie in the series was filmed nearby in Tunisia during 1976 (Episode IV - A New Hope). Perhaps it’s just mere coincidence that the “Sandcrawler,” a huge mobile fortress in the movie, is designed with a near-identical shape to the extraordinary Hotel Du Lac? Or, that the Sandcrawler slowly makes its way through the sandy dunes of a remote planet called “Tatooine” (while back in real life, a nearby area of Tunisia is named “Tataouine”)? Either way, fans continue to debate whether or not Hotel du Lac was actually an inspiration for the Sandcrawler design. Notably, various members of the crew who worked on the original Star Wars film in 1975 through 1976 have made contradicting statements on the matter. So, let’s put Star Wars fans aside, as lovers of all things Brutalist firmly agree that Hotel du Lac is one of the most important (and coolest) examples of the Brutalistalism anywhere on the planet. Unfortunately, Hotel du Lac fell into disrepair and closed in the year 2000. Since 2002, it’s been completely abandoned. More recently, the hotel was sold to Libyan investors. As of summer 2019, the combination of its prime central location, growing levels of tourist numbers, the enormous cost of renovation, and the need to recoup the huge investment means that Hotel du Lac seemingly faces destruction. The future may be uncertain, but Hotel du Lac remains extant, either as a symbol of a new independent Tunisia or one of the last marks of the colonial age. That’s probably up to each observer to decide for themselves."
97,Great Mosque of Kairouan,"Kairouan, Tunisia","Founded in 670, this ancient mosque is an architectural time portal.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-mosque-of-kairouan,"As you wander the grounds of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia you are treading across over a millennia of history. The magnificent structure — the oldest Muslim place of worship in Africa, founded in the year 670 — illustrates the mixed influences of pre-Islamic, Roman, and Byzantine architecture. The city of Kairouan, Tunisia, has long been the Maghreb’s most ancient and holy city, a key gathering place for Arabo-Muslim civilization. The Great Mosque, also known as the Uqba Mosque, is at the heart of the city’s heritage. Standing at the nexus of 15 different thoroughfares, in the center of the country between the mountains and the sea, it is considered the fourth holiest site in Islam after Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. The structure is part of an expansive complex, the mosque itself covering 10,800 square meters (115,660 square feet). Within, there is a prayer room with 17 naves supported by carved columns, as well as the finely decorated mihrab, a special niche indicating the direction of mecca, outfitted in marble panels and luster tiles covered in floral patterns. There is also a pool, known as the Old Cistern (Al-Majal al-Qadim), and what is said to be the oldest surviving minbar—a finely carved wooden pulpit of Asian teak. Outside, there is a decorated flagstone courtyard and towering, three-story minaret, reminiscent of Roman lighthouses. At 32 meters (104 feet), it remains one of the city’s highest structures. The mosque’s architecture reflects features of pre-Islamic and Eastern Islamic art, as well as later Roman and Byzantine influences. The design has served as a model for many other Maghreb mosques. The mosque was originally constructed by a general named Uqba ibn Nafi (also written as Sidi Okba) as a Friday Mosque (masjid-i jami` or jami`), used for communal prayers on the Muslim holy day. Though the structure built by Uqba no longer exists, the mosque we see today is sometimes still called “Mosque of Sidi Uqba” or simply, Uqba Mosque. The mosque was rebuilt at least twice in the 8th century, and then again in the 9th century, when Prince Ziyadat Allah I, the Aghlabid governor, demolished most of the existing structure and rebuilt the mosque in sturdier materials of stone, brick, and wood. The surviving version includes a dome—borrowed from Roman and Byzantine architecture—and supporting buttresses, added in the 13th century. The mosque sits between the city’s Rue de la Kasbah and the Rue el Farabi, in the historic walled district of the Medina. The holy structure is beautiful both during the day and at night, when the minaret is aglow with lights.  Opening hours are 8am-2pm Saturday-Thursday, and 8am-noon on Friday. Non-Muslims are not allowed in the prayer room, but the door is left open if you'd like to look inside."
98,Byrsa Hill,"Carthage, Tunisia","An ancient Phoenician citadel once stood at the site where Queen Dido first landed, according to legend.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/byrsa-hill,"According to Virgil’s The Aeneid, the ancient Phoenician city of Carthage was founded by the Tyrian princess Elissa, better known as Dido. After her brother, King Pygmalion, exiled her from her homeland, Dido sailed westward with her loyal vassals. She arrived at the North African coast and encamped on a hill overlooking what would become Carthage. The hill, which came to be known as Byrsa, was the site of a walled citadel that was the center of Carthage’s military power. As the story goes, after Dido arrived the local Berber chieftain came to her offering as much land as a single oxhide could cover. The clever princess cut the oxhide into tiny strips and placed them on the ground end to end, encircling the entire hill. Apocryphally, this is said to be the origin of  the name Byrsa, which sounds similar to a Greek word meaning “oxhide.” In reality, the story of Carthage is older than its association with the Hellenistic world. The city was founded around 814 B.C. in what is now Tunisia. As for the naming of Byrsa, there are theories more plausible than the version told in The Aeneid. The name may be a corruption of Phoenician barsat, which means “stronghold,” or it could be related to the Semitic word bostra (cliff) or Akkadian birtu (fortress). The citadel on Byrsa Hill dominated the city below, and was the keystone of its military and defense. During the Third Punic War (149–146 B.C.), the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus Africanus besieged the hill and defeated Carthage. For some time afterwards, the Roman Empire occupied the Byrsa citadel as the seat of proconsul of Africa. Carthage was then invaded and taken possession of by the 5th-century barbarian king Geiseric, who established the Vandal Kingdom’s capital on Byrsa Hill; the Vandals were defeated a century later by the Byzantine emperor Justinian. In 1884, Saint Louis Cathedral was constructed atop the ruins of an ancient temple dedicated to Eshmun, the Punic god of healing, on the peak of Byrsa Hill. A Roman Catholic church built in Byzantine-Moorish style, its usage as a place of worship was discontinued in 1964. Today it is known as the Acropolium, where public events and concerts of traditional Tunisian music are held from time to time. The Carthage National Museum, which was founded in 1875, is also located on top of Byrsa Hill. It is home to a large collection of Punic and Roman artifacts from Carthage’s bygone days."
99,Chott el Djerid,"Tozeur, Tunisia",The largest salt lake in the Sahara is mysteriously alluring.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chott-el-djerid,"Chott el Djerid (also known as Chott El-Jerid, and several other variations of spelling) is a great salt lake located in the Tunisian part of the Sahara desert. It’s known to be the largest salt lake in the Sahara, and depending on your sources, it’s also the largest salt lake on the African continent. With a surface area of more than 2,700 square miles, Chott el Djerid is over 1.5 times larger than the Great Salt Lake of Utah. The name of this lake consists of two parts: in Northern Africa, chott describes a lake that dries out in summer and usually has at least some water in it in colder seasons; el djerid is an Arabic word meaning “palm leaf” (the nearby el Djerid region in South Western Tunisia  holds 15 times more date palm trees than its human population). Chott el Djerid is (mostly) an enormous plain with a harsh desert climate and almost total lack of natural resources—including fresh water. It’s a difficult place to live, but traveling though is a different story. The barrenness could be safely described as mysteriously alluring, even beautiful. Driving across the main road that runs from the southern rim to point north-west, it’s impossible not to stop and admire the rainbow-colored salt deposits and small lakes that have water even in the driest summer days. Unexpectedly, the salty water varies in color from light green to gentle pink and vibrant orange. At the end of the lake, you will end up at a location holding many date palm oases. Chott el Djerid is situated near to the city of Douz, dubbed the “gateway to the Sahara.” A naturally spectacular back-drop, the salt lake has been used (alongside with the surrounding canyons and dunes) as a filming location for a range of movies. The Lars Family Homestead from the Star Wars series is located on the northwestern tip of the lake, right next to the town of Nafta, and Mos Espa from the same movie saga is less than 10 miles north from there. Very much pre-dating modern film-lore, Chott el Djerid is considered to be the most viable candidate for the ancient lake Tritonis mentioned in Greek mythology. Tritonis is the birthplace of the goddess named Athena, and somewhat ironically, the name Tritonis was given after another Greek god, Triton, known as the Greek god of the sea.  As Chott el Djerid is an enormous salt lake in the middle of an extremely unforgiving desert, navigating through it should be approached with some care. Make sure you have a full tank of gas, and bring more than enough drinking water with you. Going off-road here is dangerous at any time of the year, as even the hardiest four-wheel-drive vehicles may get stuck. Best to stick to the P16 road going between Douz and Tozeur, or C103 if you’re headed to or from Gafsa. Even better, look into a local guide who knows the place well."
