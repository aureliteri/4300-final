0,KGB Museum,"Tallinn, Estonia","""There's nothing there,"" and other lies the KGB told us.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kgb-museum,"After the Soviets built Tallinn’s luxurious, but imposing, Hotel Viru in the 1970s, Estonians joked that the building was made of microconcrete, as in concrete and microphones. Few people were ever allowed on the hotel’s top floor, which the Soviet managers insisted contained only technical rooms. When the KGB fled the country in the early 1990s, the newly liberated Estonians discovered that the technical rooms housed elaborate, vintage James Bond-esque listening equipment. The hotel’s new owners kept the rooms exactly as the KGB left them. On the door of those technical rooms is now written “There’s nothing here” in both English and Estonian, which alludes to the official answer given when anyone asked what was behind the door. Visitors can take guided tours that focus not only on the more absurd elements of living in a surveillance state, but on the strange history of the hotel, which includes sex work, espionage, and some of the best chicken to be had during the occupation.  The museum itself is located on the top floor of Hotel Viru, but you may only access it via guided tours which begin in the hotel lobby."
1,Rummu Underwater Prison,"Rummu, Estonia",The ruins of an Estonian prison are drowning in the quarry lake where the convicts were once forced to work.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rummu-underwater-prison,"It’s unlikely that those interred in this Soviet prison ever imagined that the quarry they were forced to work in would someday become a beautiful diving spot. But it’s a weird world, and time is long. The ruins of the abandoned prison camp outside the small Estonian town of Rummu were once a dreaded stone edifice, but are now a beach attraction. The prison was already established in the 1940s by the Soviet Union. It was built in a convenient location, on the lip of a limestone quarry in which the inmates were forced to toil. The seemingly impenetrable walls of the prison were not to last forever. When Estonia regained its independence in 1991, the Soviets moved out and many of their institutions fell, including the labor prison at Rummu. Both the prison and the quarry were abandoned in the changeover. Without anyone to look after the natural groundwater that seeped into the former quarry, it soon filled up with water, creating a new lake with alarming speed. It filled up so fast that many of the mining machines and even some of the buildings were swallowed whole by the rising waters. Today, some of the former prison can still be seen on land, as parts of the structure stick out from the crystal clear lake waters. The spot has become a prime location for divers and adventurous beachgoers who come for the sunken ruins beneath the waves.  The Rummu Prison is now open during summer as an adventure center with an entrance fee of 3€. Different activities such as snorkeling, paddleboarding, and canoeing to name a few."
2,Kaali Meteorite Crater Field,"Kaali, Estonia",Mysterious craters may have been home to an ancient cult.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaali-meteorite-crater-field,"Kaali, on the Estonian island of Saaremaa, is the site of the last giant meteorite impact to occur in a densely populated region. The landscape that the collision left in its aftermath has been the subject of many mythological tales and may have been home to a mysterious ancient cult. About 7,500 years ago, a huge rock from space came hurtling toward the Earth. Several kilometers above the Earth’s surface, the meteorite broke into pieces from the pressure and heat of the atmosphere. The resulting chunks collided into Saaremaa with the force of a small nuclear bomb, wreaking havoc on the landscape and possibly claiming numerous victims. The explosion left nine total craters, now known as the Kaali Meteorite Crater Field. Some of these craters are quite small: one measures only twelve meters across and one meter deep. But the most interesting of the group is the largest crater, a gently sloping bowl filled with stagnant, murky water. Simply known as Kaali crater, the largest crater (which measures 110 meters across) is believed to have been a sacred site for many centuries, in part due to its cosmic origin. Surrounding Kaali crater are the remains of an immense stone wall from the Late Bronze Age, stronger than any similar structures in the region and providing clues to the crater’s use by ancient peoples. Archaeologists believe it is possible that the wall served as a stronghold for an ancient cult settlement. As evidenced by the unusually large quantity of animal bones found within the wall’s borders, the Kaali crater lake was not only a watering place but also a place of sacrifice. While it is known that Estonians have made live offerings in the past (for good harvests and other reasons), one curious aspect of the site’s animal remains is that some date back only to the 1600s, long after the Church forbade such rituals. Some even believe that ancient offerings still remain undiscovered at the bottom of the six-meter-deep Kaali lake. However, deposits of oak trees in the water have prevented scientists from probing beyond four meters below the surface. Whatever the case may be, Kaali is a site of indisputable importance, historically and scientifically speaking. The experience doesn’t end at the crater field. There is even a Kaali Meteor Museum and Hotel—in case you want to stay for another day among ancient cult ruins and the evidence of terrifying destruction. Kaali Visitor Centre is in Kaali meteorite field. It is about 3 km from Kuivastu on the Kuressaare road 18 km from Kuressaare and 62 km from Kuivastu. Regular local buses stop in Kaali Village several times a day."
3,Linnahall,"Tallinn, Estonia",An empty relic of the Moscow Olympics crumbles away in Estonia's capital.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/linnahall,"When Moscow hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics, the sailing events were held in Soviet-occupied Estonia. Linnahall, originally called the “V. I. Lenin Palace of Culture and Sport,” is a sprawling ziggurat-like complex designed to host the Olympic regatta. Today, it’s all but abandoned, and mostly visited by graffiti artists and curious tourists. The structure was commissioned by the Soviet Union in part to show the world their mastery over concrete-pouring. In addition to its massive 5,000 seat amphitheater, it includes an ice hall, a small seaport, and a heliport. The ice hall closed in 2009, and the concert hall in 2010. The hurried construction of the building has begun to show over the past 30 years as the poorly finished rock crumbles. The arena is still used from time to time when a large enough event comes to the country, but generally, the huge structure sits empty. Locals and tourists still enjoy taking the external steps up to the roof of the hall, which provides a rather stunning view of Tallinn’s skyline. As many important buildings in the Soviet Union, the design of Linnahall was planned to be also useful during wartime. The location by the sea and the flat roofs made it a perfect spot for tanks or cannons to cover the whole bay of Tallinn, in case the “evil” Finns would want to conquer the city. In 2019 the City of Tallinn announced plans to transform the structure into a conference center, including an opera and concert hall.  As of 2019, most of the structure is blocked off by safety fences. The rooftop, with its magnificent view, is the only part of the building that can be visited."
4,Ichthus Art Gallery,"Tallinn, Estonia",A secluded art gallery hidden within the cellars beneath Tallinn’s medieval monastery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ichthus-art-gallery,"When wandering around Tallinn, Estonia, you’re bound to find little alcoves, tiny courtyards, and winding streets that make you feel as though you’ve stepped back in time. Saint Catherine’s Dominican Monastery, one of the oldest buildings in the city, is one such place. But upon closer inspection, it becomes evident there are two things for visitors to explore at the medieval site, not just one. You can choose to go up the stairs to the left and enter the main part of the monastery where the monks lived. Or, you can decide to head to the right where an open iron gate and wooden doors lead to a steep staircase that, despite descending into a deep gloom, somehow still looks promising. At the bottom of this staircase, beneath the interior courtyard, you can find a display with an old book of photos and writing that offers a tidbit of the history of the Dominican monks. The room opens into a series of connected cellars where monks worked from 1246 to 1524. There’s an enormous fireplace in one part, and if you follow the narrow hallways back deeper into the rooms, you’ll discover a small, blocked off stairway (maybe a shortcut?) up to the surface. There is also a nice sitting area under an alcove. These ancient underground rooms hold original works of art for sale by the the man who currently rents the space, an artist named Aleksandr Savchenkov. The artist is usually in the small gallery, called Ichthus Art Gallery, constructing new pieces while the occasional visitor mills about among the watercolor paintings and Savchenkov’s for-sale work, to a muted soundtrack of Latin chants playing from a discreet CD player.  There is a donation box underneath the map of the monastery. They request a donation but no amount is set."
5,Pähni Megaphones,"Varstu Parish, Estonia",A trio of giant wooden megaphones turn up nature's volume in this Estonian forest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pahni-megaphones,"Anyone who is sick and tired of the peace and quiet afforded by the solitude of nature should head over to Estonia’s Võru county forest and take a listen through the giant wooden microphones found in their clearing. These wooden tubes were installed in a clearing deep within the Estonian forest by a group of interior architecture students. Since the region is known for its natural beauty, they decided to create the over-sized amplifiers to enhance the sounds of the waving trees and birds singing. The project was named RUUP. Installed far from any homes or other signs of civilization, the cones have nothing to pick up but the natural sounds emanating from the flora and fauna all around. In addition to pumping up the scenic volume, the megaphones are large enough to climb inside and sit or lay down. In fact when the project was finally complete, musicians came and played music while seated right in the funnels. It is pretty hard to improve on nature, but increasing the decibels seems to be pretty effective. Each of the three megaphones is even placed so that were you to stand in the middle of their directional cones, it could in theory have a 3D effect on the sounds. In reality it is really difficult to tell as the forest overwhelms you."
6,Tuhala Witch's Well,"Kose Parish, Estonia","This disappearing geyser has been attributed to witchcraft, but really it's all about rainfall.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tuhala-witchs-well,"Located in the tiny village of Tuhala, the Witch’s Well is a naturally occurring geyser that has been known to flood the entire area after heavy rains. Clearly the work of witches. The Witch’s Well is actually an example of what is known as a “karst spring.” The opening from which the spring issues is located over an underground river, which is normally located far enough underground that it isn’t a problem. But after extremely heavy rains, the river tends to swell up and issue forth from the well, completely flooding the surrounding area. The geyser effect can last for days, making for a major disaster for those effected by the flooding. In olden times, this pandemonium was not seen as simply an unfortunate natural occurence, but was instead blamed on those perennial villains, witches. According to the local lore, witches would gather down in the well and lash each other with branches. This pagan reverie was thought to cause the catastrophic flooding that came periodically came from the well. Unfortunately, it was just nature. The well does not flood each time it rains, but just occasionally. It is often years between each flooding, so when it occurs, people now come from all around to check it out. A wooden cap has been placed over the natural hole, so even though it can be damaging, the Witch’s Well certainly looks like it has caged a witch inside of its depths."
7,Seaplane Harbour,"Tallinn, Estonia",Disused seaplane hangar gets a second life as the jaw-dropping home of Estonia's museum of maritime history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/seaplane-harbour,"Completed in 1917 as part of Peter the Great’s naval fortress, the Tallinn seaplane hangars were unique in their day for both their size and technology. The building was among the first reinforced concrete shell structures realized at such an enormous magnitude, measuring in at a whopping 39-by-109 meters. Only over the course of the next decade or so would analogous structures begin to crop up in rest of the world, particularly during the aviation boom of the 1930s. Back in Estonia, the 1920s and 1930s found the Seaplane Harbor serving as a holiday resort for the Estonian air force unit, providing an athletics hall as well as a tennis court under the hangars. After the Second World War, the hangars were taken over by the Soviet Army. They lost their importance, were neglected and mainly used as warehouses and wood shops. When Soviet forces left and their assets were taken over by the Estonian government, the hangars were at the center of judicial dispute for a decade. Throughout this time, the building went unmaintained, and the general public was left wondering what was going on inside. Only in 2006 did the government obtain ownership of the property again, at which point it invested in the renovations and restoration necessary to save the building from further decay. Currently the former hangars have been repurposed as the jaw-dropping home of the Estonian Maritime Museum’s collection. The museum’s exhibit includes the oldest shipwrecks found in Estonia, an explorable submarine called “Lembit” and a full size replica of a British seaplane, as well as a myriad of other related historic paraphernalia unique to the region. The real star here, though, is the old seaplane hangar itself; sound and light design create a surreal effect of feeling as if one is underwater, with waves lapping at the ceiling. Periodically a light show of planes traverses the big concrete domes.  Seaplane Harbour17 Küti Street / 6 Vesilennuki Street10415 Tallinn, Estonia"
8,Ungru Manor,"Ridala Parish, Estonia",The gutted remains of this Estonian mansion are a monument to a tragic love.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ungru-manor,"While it’s hard to see this in its current, dilapidated state, but at one point, Ungru Manor was the finest neo-baroque mansion in all of Estonia. But after it was stripped of materials to help build a nearby runway it is is simply a rotting husk, surrounded by a sad love story that never happened. Created as a near-perfect copy of Merseburg Castle in Halle, Germany, the manor that remains today was built in the 1890s on the site of a manor that had been there since the 1500s. As the story goes, the son of Ungru’s owner visited Merseberg Castle and fell in love with the princess there. He proposed, but the princess was so fond of her father’s castle, she claimed that she was going to stay there forever, so the son returned home and vowed to recreate the German castle for her. He went back to Estonia and began construction, building out most of the structure including most of the exterior and its 11 gables. However before the interior could be finished, word came that the princess had died. The son himself died not long after in 1908. The house was left incomplete and without an owner. The tragic monument sat empty and was slowly pillaged for valuables and materials by local scavengers. During Soviet rule of Estonia, an airfield for fighter jets was constructed nearby and the builders used the mansion as a source of raw materials. Today, the airfield is equally abandoned. Luckily, what remains of the estate is now protected from further destruction, so the site is not completely lost to history. The gutted remains are visible from a nearby highway and interested explorers can still visit them should the tragic origin fail to break their heart and cancel the trip."
9,Telliskivi Creative City,"Tallinn, Estonia",Estonia's largest creative city is a vibrant bohemian hub located within a former industrial complex.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/telliskivi-creative-city,"The Telliskivi Creative City is Estonia’s largest creative center. Though it’s about a 15 minute walk from the historic Old Town, it’s worth the slight detour to wander through and see what the thriving artistic community has to offer. The creative city, which consists of 10 buildings that hold over 200 businesses and organizations, has an easygoing bohemian vibe. Each individual business is at liberty to design its space as it sees fit. The eclectic array of mismatched décor creates a vibrant, artistic atmosphere. You don’t have to go to Telliskivi to do something particular—it’s a lovely spot just to kill some free time. It’s a perfect place for hanging out and meeting locals. There are many restaurants, cafes, and shops for different budgets and tastes. There’s also a yoga studio, a concert hall, and even a massage studio. It’s also the place where many events are held. On Saturdays, Telliskivi hosts the biggest flea market in Tallinn, where you can spend hours browsing through selections of artwork, antiques, and oddities. There’s also a massive annual food festival that draws in thousands of people. Telliskivi allowed Tallinn’s artists and free spirits to reclaim a neglected part of their city. The Telliskivi Creative City breathed new life into a drab former factory complex that originally popped up around the old Baltic Railway tracks. Go there by tram number 1 or 2 and hop off at ""Telliskivi."" Or, you can just walk there from old town. It's only a 10 minute walk."
10,Piusa Sand Caves,"Piusa, Estonia",Man-made mineral caves house massive bat colony.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/piusa-sand-caves,"Just beneath the ground in the Piusa Sand Caves, is a massive group of hibernating bats. Having made their home in the man-made passages since the 1950s, the size of this protected bat house has swelled to become the largest bat colony in all of the Baltic States. Beginning in 1922, miners began to hollow out the area that is now the Piusa Caves. Excavating for glass-sand, miners carefully hollowed out the sandstone into long corridors, open galleries and surprisingly elegant vaulted ceilings. Starkly different from other mines that are blasted apart or simply hacked to death, the Piusa Caves almost seem like a planned underground development. Whether the bats thought so or not, they moved in, and have been protected in the caves since 1958. By 1970, mining had tapered off completely, and the caves are now only known for their bats. Counted at a remarkable 3000 bats in 1999, five different species of bats have flourished in the underground world, causing many scientists to come to Estonia to study them. Although the caves can be explored, visitors are warned to stay on marked paths only to avoid injury in the delicate caves, and to not stir up the flying mammals.  The views in most of the pictures are behind a locked door - access them via the official tour. It is inexpensive and informative."
11,Haunted Guest House,"Tallinn, Estonia",Spend your honeymoon where the Devil had his wedding.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/haunted-guest-house,"Legend says that once upon a time the landlord of the Old House guest house had fallen on the hard times and, desperate for money, he rented the house to a cloaked stranger for one night only under the condition of complete privacy. Like in any good horror movie, someone did the exact opposite of what they should have and looked through the keyhole into the room on the third floor where the party was raging. The next morning, the Peeping Tom was found pale and gray-haired. The last thing he managed to say before dying was that he saw the Devil getting married. Guests can still rent rooms at the house and hear the clinking of glasses at the diabolical party, but should keep their eyes on their own keyholes if they want to survive the night."
12,Tallinn Kiek in de Kök,"Tallinn, Estonia","This medieval Estonian tower provides access to a series of tunnels that have been home to soldiers, punks, and fine art.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tallinn-kiek-in-de-kok,"Tallinn, Estonia’s Kiek in de Kök (translated as “Peep into the Kitchen” since the high tower windows could see into the kitchens of the houses around it) is a historic fortification which includes a system of tunnels which have been used for all manner of subterranean purpose but are not open as a museum. Neighboring a number of countries (Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Russia), the city of Tallinn has had a historic need for fortification. The Kiek in de Kök was built in 1475 to defend the city from invaders and the 16th century cannonballs still embedded in the outer walls show that it did its job admirably. As the centuries churned on, the simple tower was expanded and a series of tunnels was added to the fortification in the 17th century. The bastion tunnels were originally intended to shelter men, ammunition, and supplies, and were also used as an observation post to spy enemies. However they were never put to use in the era of their building since Tallinn was hit with a plague that effectively removed them from the wars of the time. Having missed their original calling, the tunnels were then used to house prisoners for a time. After the World War I the tunnels were again adapted to be used as air-raid shelters saving a number of lives when Tallinn was bombed during World War II. During the Cold War the tunnels were equipped with independent electricity, ventilation, water, and phone connections, preparing to shelter the noble elite in case of a nuclear strike. Luckily the bomb was never dropped and the tunnels were once again without a purpose, so they were put to use as a store room to house sculptures from the National Art Foundation. After couple of years the sculptures were moved elsewhere in the fear of art thieves finding a way into the wide network of passages. Once the art was removed the tunnels were left empty and soon slipped into disrepair. Since that the tunnels were empty. Soon the abandoned passages were being used by punks and rebels to hide from the police who avoided the tunnels because of heavy rat and flea infestations. The corridors also became home to a number of displaced people seeking shelter. In 2005 the Kiek in de Kök was finally turned into a museum and the tunnels were cleaned of both humans and vermin so that they could be opened to the public. Today the tower and its tunnels display exhibitions on the history of Tallinn and the tower as well as contemporary art. Time will tell how long the tunnels can keep just one purpose.  The tunnels can be visited by previous appointment only. Entry is free with the Tallinn Card and a ticket covers the museums in the towers joined by a section of the curtain wall."
13,Kingdom of Torgu,"Laadla, Estonia",A clerical error gave rise to this imaginary micronation in the southwestern corner of Estonia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kingdom-of-torgu,"The so-called Kingdom of Torgu was formed back in 1992, soon after the Republic of Estonia gained independence from the Soviet Union. At the time, the Sõrve peninsula on the island of Saaremaa was divided into two municipalities, Salme and Torgu parish. But while the new constitution of Estonia was being formed, civil servants simply forgot to count in the Torgu parish at all. Thanks to this human error, this 48.8-square-mile area was technically not governed by the constitution. The 500-odd people who lived in the area were surprised by this negligence, but soon decided to take advantage of the mistake. They came up with the idea of starting their own country, and calling it a kingdom. The throne was offered to a journalist and political activist named Kirill Teiter, who accepted it and became the first (and only) monarch to reign over the newly formed Kingdom of Torgu. The kingdom has its own flag, a coat of arms with a “snail-dragon” as the emblematic animal, and its own currency in coins, the “kirill,” with the worth of 1 kirill fixed to the price of a half-liter of local vodka. When a new law was passed in 1993, the Torgu area was once again officially counted into the constitution, but the locals had grown fond of being in their own kingdom and continued to go along with it nonetheless. In 2017, all the municipalities on the island were merged into one, but the spirit of the kingdom still lives in the hearts of the local residents. You can see the Torgu flags waving and the coat of arms presented here and there throughout the former parish. The border marks delineating Torgu’s boundaries are used in commemorative days and anniversaries only, but if you head to the far end of Sõrve peninsula, you will definitely be inside the borders of the kingdom.  The map location points to a local shop where you can find some of the royal regalia like postcards and stamps. This region has some other well-known sights inside the borders of the kingdom: The Sõrve Military Museum, Stebel Military Defence Battery, and Sõrve Lighthouse are the most well-known places to visit."
14,Glehn Park,"Tallinn, Estonia",A forest park outside Tallinn full of architectural and artistic curiosities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glehn-park,"Located on the outskirts of Tallinn, Glehn Park was developed by an eccentric landowner named Nikolai von Glehn. He designed and built himself a castle on the grounds, which was completed in 1886. At the time it must have been a real treasure of art brut, decorated with eclectic reliefs and a mix of Latin, Greek, French, Russian, and German texts. Glehn also designed his own furniture, chairs, and tables with carved figurines as decorations. Unfortunately, the whole place was looted during World War I and nothing of the original interior is left. (The building now belongs to a local university and is used for receptions and events.) Another architectural gem on the grounds is the palm house that stood opposite the castle. It is a half-underground, multiple-story building with a mosaic roof covered with colorful glass panels. It is in ruins today, but it still amazes with its Gaudi-esque style. A little ways further out in the forest you’ll also find a small observatory tower. Still, the most curious aspect of this park may be the sculptures. The most notable of them is a sculpture of a strange horned man. It is often considered to be the Devil, but actually, it is meant to represent a mythical hero of Estonian folklore, named Kalevipoeg. The Kalevipoeg sculpture is about 33 feet (10 meters) tall and was modeled on the measurements of Glehn himself, upsized four times. The original sculpture was also destroyed during the war, because Russian troops were afraid that the horns were actually a secret transmitter device signaling information to German ships. A restored replica now stands next to the debris of the original. Behind the Kalevipoeg is a sculpture of a crocodile. The pair together was meant to symbolize a beast lurking behind a hero.  The Glehn Park Hiking Trail is 1.5 miles (2.45 km) long. It's part of the Nõmme-Harku Health Parks."
15,Hara Submarine Base,Estonia,A decommissioned submarine base makes a great space for graffiti art.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hara-submarine-base,"Once occupied by an invading Soviet invasion force, the abandoned submarine base near Hara, Estonia is now being invaded by urban explorers and the curious. Hara Submarine base was built by the Russian military between 1956 and 1958 and was used while they occupied Estonia until they fled in 1991 around the time of Estonian independence. The site has since fallen into disrepair and while the concrete foundations remain, the buildings have been gutted. The pier-like ruins are now a favorite location for anyone on an urban safari.  On the coast, down a little track that says there is CCTV! There is a booth now, and an admission fee of 6 EUR is required."
16,Lítla Dímun,"Lítla Dímun, Faroe Islands",This isolated island is often capped by its own fluffy cloud.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/litla-dimun,"Lítla Dímun is the smallest of the Faroe Islands’ 18 main islands. But though it may be tiny, the islet still has the power to influence the atmosphere. A lenticular cloud often drapes over it like a wet, vapory blanket. These stationary clouds typically form over mountain peaks or other protruding landmasses. Lítla Dímun’s lenticular hovers above its top, occasionally spilling down over the verdant land as it reaches toward the cold sea. Of the Faroe Islands’ main islands, the little landmass is the only one that remains uninhabited by humans. But people do visit the island. For centuries, Faroese farmers have made the precarious journey to Lítla Dímun to tend to the creatures who rule the islet: its sheep. Up until the middle of the 19th century, Lítla Dímun sheep ruled the little green haven. It’s believed these black, short-tailed feral sheep were the descendants of the animals brought to the area during the Neolithic era. But after the last of these rare creatures was shot in the 1800s, rendering the bloodline extinct, the island became home to domesticated Faroes sheep. Every fall, farmers head to Lítla Dímun, scale its slick cliffs, and round up the sheep to bring them back to the main islands.  You'll most likely have to stick to admiring this island from the villages of Hvalba and Sandvík on the island of Suðuroy. It is possible to visit Lítla Dímun, though it's rare to have weather that's good enough to make a visit feasible, as you must use the ropes left by the farmers to help climb the cliffs."
17,Kallur Lighthouse,"Trøllanes, Faroe Islands",This isolated structure beckons adventurers with sublime views of the Faroe Islands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kallur-lighthouse,"The scenery surrounding the simple lighthouse at Kallur is dramatic: Craggy cliffs clad in layers of green grass spike toward a sky so blue it seems to merge with the sea. Wind-whipped clouds billow above while waves lash the land below. On a wet, stormy day (and there are many of those), stray wisps of sunlight mingle with the mist to create the occasional rainbow. The rustic, red and white lighthouse tops the northern tip of the island of Kalsoy. The isolated structure helps guide ships around the cluster of lands that crops up from the Atlantic Ocean to form the Faroe Islands. The picturesque scene around the lighthouse invites visitors to bask in the island’s beauty. Reaching this sublime spot requires a bit of effort, however. Visitors must follow an unmarked trail through stretches of vivid, verdant fields. Expect to encounter sheep along the way, and keep an eye out for their stone shelters—they’re a sign you’re on the right path. Though the island and its signature lighthouse are remote, they’re worth the trek. In addition to offering gorgeous views, the northern parts of Kalsoy are also an important birding area. The cliffs are a critical breeding place for seabirds like Atlantic puffins, European storm petrels, and black guillemots. The island of Kalsoy is sparsely populated. Only around 150 people call it home. A network of roads and tunnels connects the four settlements that are scattered around the flute-shaped landmass.  Hiking this path can be rough and muddy during most of the year.  Fog can also engulf the area and make the hike a bit more of a challenge. Once you reach the lighthouse, you will need to go a bit further along a steep path to get the epic view. This path does not have rails or anything to protect one from the harsh inclines on both sides so go at your own risk. You can reach the island via a ferry from Klaksvik (get there early as they fill up) or by helicopter. It is recommended to read about weather conditions and driving conditions in the Faroe Islands before heading to Kalsoy. The tunnels are all one lane and can be frightening for those who have never driven in such."
18,Lake Sørvágsvatn,Faroe Islands,The largest lake in the Faroe Islands seems to be held hundreds of feet above sea level thanks to an optical illusion.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-sorvagsvatn,"Lake Sørvágsvatn is 3.4 square kilometers in size, more than three times the size of the second biggest lake among the Faroe archipelago, Fjallavatn, and when viewed from above it appears to be contained far above the surrounding ocean. When viewed from afar, its seems that the lake is tilted towards the ocean, but only spills over in one small waterfall. This optical illusion also creates the impression that the reservoir is located hundreds of feet above sea level. In actuality, the elevation difference between the lake and the ocean is only about 30 meters; however, steep and significant elevation changes in the surrounding hills give the lake its seemingly impossible look. The lake is situated in a deep depression, and its towering headland rises 252 and 376 meters on the left and right sides. There is also some controversy regarding the lake’s name, since the people of Sørvágsvatn village take pride in naming the body of water after their home, while the citizens of some of the other nearby towns would rather call the lake “Leitisvatn,” since some of its waters intersect with their towns as well. Yet regardless of what the waters are called, the illusion they create is nothing less than nature pulling a big prank on all of us."

A ring of tall mountains cuts it off from the rest of its own island, and, for most of its existence, from the rest of the world at large. Prior to 2004, there were only a couple of ways to get to Gásadalur Village. One option was to hike over the mountain terrain that surrounds the settlement, which rises over 2,000 feet high, and then trek for even more miles to the village. The other option was to clamber up the cliff face from any ship brave enough to venture that close to the rocks. In the 1940s a staircase was built into the cliff rocks to make travel a bit easier, but other than that, progress in terms of making the remote village accessible was almost nil. Because of this isolation, the population of the village fell dramatically despite a number of good, workable fields in their landlocked region. The number of citizens had dropped into the teens by the time a tunnel was blasted through one of the mountains allowing automobile travel to the small community. While the hope is that the population will grow with the use of the access tunnel, as of 2012 the reported population is still only 18. However the smaller population has ensured that the historically quaint houses and unspoiled vistas all around will stay around a bit longer."
20,Skarð,"Kunoy, Faroe Islands","The abandoned village of Skarð aptly illustrates the idiom ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skar-1,"“Tis the part of wise man to keep himself today for tomorrow, and not venture all his eggs in one basket” wrote Cervantes, in Don Quixote in 1605. While the sentiment has been challenged (most notably by Mark Twain who wrote “Put all your eggs in the one basket and watch that basket”) in the case of Skarð Village, in the Faroe Islands, the idiom is apt. On December 23, 1913 the day before Christmas Eve, all seven able-bodied men of the village climbed into a single fishing boat (quite possibly the only one in the village) and set out onto the North Atlantic Ocean presumably to catch a feast for the coming holiday. The men never returned. Without men (able-bodied ones at least, a young boy and an old man remained) the remaining women and children left the town for Haraldssund, and the last inhabitant left only six years after the accident, in 1919. Skarð remains a ghost town to this day, complete with crumbling stone houses. Haraldssund, where the Skarð villagers resettled, isn’t much better off with a current population of only 70. Two footpaths run to Skarð. One runs along the coast from Haraldssund; the other is a high mountain trail over Skarðsgjógv from the west coast town of Kunoy. The latter climbs about 600 metres and is a challenging route recommended for experienced mountain hikers only, though the villagers frequently used it to walk to Kunoy for Church services."
21,The Nykur of Sørvágsvatn,Faroe Islands,"In Faroese legend, this sinister horse-shaped beast lures unsuspecting passersby only to drown them in the lake.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nykur-of-sorvagsvatn,"A Nykur is a mythical beast of Scandinavian folklore. It’s often depicted as an aquatic monster that takes the shape of a gray, horse-like creature with inverted hoofs. The Nykur generally appears on the lakeshore, with half its body in the water, and looks to be quite tame to its unsuspecting victims. The legendary Nykur (also known as the “Nix” in English) uses its beauty to lure passersby to pet and mount it, and once an unsuspecting man, woman, or child does so, the beast’s “sticky skin” traps them in a terrifying barrel roll as it drags them down to the bottom of the lake to drown. This legend is mostly invoked by parents of small children, to scare them away from the edge of dangerous bodies of water. The Nykur’s one weakness is that if someone calls its name aloud, the creature will lose all of its power and retreat to the depths from which it came. And the Faroese legends say that once, a small child happened to see a Nykur roaming through the shallow water of Lake Sørvágsvatn while he was out playing. In awe of the creature’s beauty, the child approached the Nykur. The child wanted his brother, Niklas, to see the pretty horse as well, so he called out to him. Since the child was still small and unable to speak properly, he accidentally shouted the word “Nykur” instead of “Niklas.” Thus having spoken the creature’s name, it lost all its power and returned to the deep cold waters of lake Sørvágsvatn to try its luck another day. On the island of Vágar in the Faroe Islands, a silver statue of the mythical Nykur rises from the northern tip of Lake Sørvágsvatn. The statue was created by local artist Pól Skarðenni, and appeared in the waters of the lake in 2017. Nearby, a plaque tells the legend of this sinister beast.  You have to pass this statue if you are heading to Torshavn from the Vágar airport. It is well visible from main road. There is also a turn off to access the lake and get a closer look if you like."
22,St. Magnus Cathedral,"Kirkjubøur, Faroe Islands","This mysterious, medieval cathedral remains unbuilt but fiercely protected.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-magnus-cathedral,"Abandoned before it was finished, this cathedral stands as a reminder of the Middle Ages, a time when its small village was a cultural and religious hub within the Faroe Islands. Not a lot is known about the half-built St. Magnus Cathedral, which was erected sometime in the 13th century but never completed. Even still, it remains a major draw in Kirkjubøur, the southernmost village on Streymoy, one of the 18 of the Faroe Islands. Since 1997, conservation efforts have kept the cathedral ruins from further disintegrating. The preservation project has also increasingly drawn visitors to Kirkjubøur. However, since 2010, the efforts have slowed down a bit and the cathedral is slowly being consumed by the elements. St. Magnus Cathedral is located at the southern tip of Kirkjubøur, next to the family farmhouse (called Kirkjubøargarður)and St. Olav’s church, both structures dating to the year 1110 and still in use today. In fact, the farmhouse is occupied by the 13th generation of the Patursson family. Family patriarch and arguably among the most famous of Faroese artists, glass artist and sculptor Tróndur Patursson lives in a hillside home just up the road from the village’s more prominent landmarks. (His house is the one with all the beautiful glasswork on the facade.) Today, Kirkjubøargarður is a museum that you can visit with a trust system for payment (you can drop a payment inside). If you look out to sea from St. Magnus Cathedral, you will see Kirkjubøhólmur, a small islet that contains many remnants from historic Kirkjubøur that perished along with around 50 homes in the village during a 16th-century storm.  In addition to the typical guided tours, the village is easily reached by public bus from Torshavn, and it's popular to hike between the seaside village and capital city on a path over the grassy, sheep-grazed hillsides in between, which is (relatively) well-marked with cairns."
23,Múli,"Múli, Faroe Islands","Despite finally receiving electricity in 1970, this tiny town is now deserted.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/muli,"Located on the Island of Borðoy in the Norðoyar Region of the Faroes, the barely-there hamlet of Múli is now mostly a ghost town, receiving the gifts of modern electricity too late to save the town from becoming little more than a collection of half-abandoned vacation homes. People have been settling on the Island of Borðoy since as early as the 13th century, but the small community clinging to the rocky Faroe coast has never grow too large. The tiny encampment has rested quietly on its land down the centuries, always teetering on the edge of complete depopulation, subsisting on a simple, rustic lifestyle among stunning mountain surrounds. It was not even until 1970 that electricity came to the town (the last town to be added to the power grid!) providing a rare splash of modernity to the remaining citizens. Years later, as the prospect of Múli becoming completely abandoned once again loomed, a road was finally built to link the community to the not-much-bigger town of Norðdepil. Unfortunately none of these measures could prevent the abandonment of the town, which as of 2002 has just four registered residents, although even this number may be a bit inflated. In reality, many of the still standing buildings that once composed Múli are now only used by vacationers on holiday. Even after surviving for hundreds of years, not even the promise of a modern upgrade could keep this tiny town alive."
24,Eysturoyartunnilin (Eysturoy Tunnel),"Tórshavn, Faroe Islands","Located more than 600 feet beneath the North Atlantic seabed, this tunnel boasts the world's first undersea roundabout.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eysturoyartunnilin-rundkoyringin,"The Eysturoyartunnilin (Eysturoy Tunnel) connects Streymoy and Eysturoy, the two largest of the Faroe Islands, a North Atlantic archipelago located more than 300 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of Scotland. The tunnel, which officially opened to car traffic at the end of 2020, measures over 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) long. At its deepest point, the tunnel is 189 meters (613.5 feet) below the seabed. The most interesting part of this infrastructure project, though, is the colorful intersection at its center—the first undersea roundabout in the world. The roundabout links the capital city of Tórshavn to both sides of the Skálafjørður fjord. Not only is it extra-convenient (cutting down travel time between Tórshavn and Runavík from over an hour to around 16 minutes), it’s also a feast for the senses. At its center stands a sculpture created by local Faroese artist Tróndur Patursson. Color-changing lights on a central support structure illuminate a piece of steel that Patursson shaped to represent people participating in a traditional Faroese chain dance. There’s even music, composed especially for this unique driving experience—just tune your radio to 97.0 when you drive through the tunnel. Eysturoyartunnilin is the third underwater tunnel to be built in the Faroe Islands. The first was Vágatunnilin (Vágar Tunnel), which connects the islands of Vágar and Streymoy and opened in 2002. After that was Norðoyartunnilin (the Northern Isles Tunnel), which links Eysturoy and the island of Borðoy and opened in 2006. Another tunnel, the Sandoyartunnilin, is currently under construction. Once complete, it will connect the islands of Streymoy and Sandoy."
25,Faroe Islands One-Lane Tunnels,Faroe Islands,The narrow passages will challenge even the bravest driver.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/faroe-islands-one-lane-tunnels,"Driving in the Faroe Islands can be daunting: there are sheep blocking the roads, the weather is unpredictable, and fog can sweep in at any time. But the unilluminated one-lane tunnels may be the biggest challenge drivers face. The mountainous terrain of the Faroe Islands has always been difficult for the people living there. Until tunnels were constructed, entire villages remained isolated, accessible only via long hikes or by sea. Though the tunnels were indeed a useful addition, they can make for some hairy driving. Driving through the one-lane tunnels can be challenging and invoke a feeling of horror-filled joy in even the most experienced driver. The one-lane tunnels have passing places spaced about 330 feet apart, where cars heading in opposite directions can yield to one another. When approaching one of these tunnels, you’ll want to make sure there’s a fair amount of distance between you and any other cars, so everyone can ensure they have access to one of these passing places. You’ll also need to keep your headlights on while you’re on the move, as the tunnels are usually pitch black. But as with most rules, there are exceptions as to who is expected to yield. The passing places are too small for buses or trucks, so they automatically get the right-of-way, even if the passing space is on their side of the road. If you encounter a truck or bus, you’ll have to pull over to “their” side of the road, turn your lights off, and wait for them to pass.  There are 10 one-lane tunnels spread out over the Faroe Islands."
26,Rinkusteinar,"Oyndarfjørður, Faroe Islands","Two massive boulders, rocking back and forth with the ebbing of the sea.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rinkusteinar,"In the Faroe Islands, two huge and mysterious boulders have been rocking away in the sea for as long as anyone can remember. Located on the northeastern edge of the island of Eysturoy, the village of Oyndarfjørður has all of 180 residents and was effectively completely isolated until 1969, when a paved road was finally completed. Just before the entrance to the village, there is a sign for the pathway to the rocking stones (Rinkusteinar), which are nestled off the side of the road near the inlet where the locals keep their boats. The stones themselves are a few meters from shore. Although they must weigh several tons each, they lightly bob along with the rocking of the sea (or at least one does - the second has been wedged into a permanent position by two stone blocks). Legend has it that an old sorceress cursed two pirate ships that were menacing the village - turning them to stone and condemning them to an eternity of restless rocking, tantalizingly close a forbidden shore. A chain connected to the mainland makes it easier to see the rock’s movements and - on a quiet day - you can hear the water mumble around the stone’s subtle disturbance."
27,Trøllkonufingur,"Sandavágur, Faroe Islands",Legend says this rock spire is the finger of a witch who wanted to throw the Faroe Islands towards Iceland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trollkonufingur,"With a name that translates from Faroese as “troll woman’s finger,” Trøllkonufingur is an interesting and unique rock feature situated southeast of Sandavágur, a small settlement on the island of Vágar. This spindly monolith on the rugged coastline of the Faroe Islands measures 313 meters (1,026 feet) tall and it can be seen from many miles away. Not only is it a remarkable geological feature, it also holds significance in local legend. It is said that Trøllkonufingur is the finger of a large witch who arrived on the Faroe Islands to attempt to throw them northwards to Iceland. The legend holds that she was unsuccessful in this mission, instead reaching the sea by Vágar and turning into stone from the power of the sun. Due to her sheer size, it is said that she fell backwards into the ocean, with only her finger sticking out of the water. That pointed appendage became what is now known as the Trøllkonufingur. Only 11 hardy climbers are known to have made it to the top of this rocky feature. In 1844, a member of the royal entourage of Denmark got to the summit so that he could wave to the passing Crown Prince Frederick VII, who was sailing past in the sea. It is said that after descending successfully, he realized he had left his glove on the top of the rock. Tragically, after climbing back up to retrieve this, his fatigue alongside the treacherous conditions led to him slipping and falling to his death.  A short walk from the town of Sandavágur gives a great vantage point of the Trøllkonufingur. Climbing the rock is not recommended!"
28,Mykines Hólmur Lighthouse,"Mykines, Faroe Islands",This isolated and westernmost point of the Faroe Islands archipelago is home to thousands of seabirds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mykines-holmur-lighthouse,"Mykines Holmur Lighthouse sits on the westernmost point of the Faroe Islands archipelago and offers quite remarkable views of the surrounding ocean, steep sea cliffs, and many species of birds including puffins, gannets, fulmars, and kittiwakes. The island of Mykines is one of the 18 main islands that make up the Faroe Islands. In 1925, the population of the island was 179 but more recent records show that the number now fluctuates between 10 to 15 people, making this a very isolated place to live. A small ferry visits the island, but the isolated location means that it is weather dependent and does not always run. The Mykines Holmur Lighthouse is situated at the far end of the island and the unspoiled surroundings give off a fascinating feel of remoteness. The lighthouse was built in 1909 and provided light for ships to navigate, as well as acted as a weather station. A house was constructed for the lighthouse keeper and historic notes state that the site was used by the University of Copenhagen to observe the Northern Lights. The Mykines lighthouse became automated in 1970.  Be sure to look at the forecast as the ferry to Mykines is very weather dependent."

According to the resort’s website, the unique travel destination was started back in 1973 when its founder, Jussi, was traveling down the lonely roads just south of Finland’s northernmost fishing village. As the story goes, his car broke down, and he was forced to make camp near the isolated roadside woods. Instead of just thinking of this excursion as a minor inconvenience, he fell in love with the spot and set up a permanent roadside stop-in that eventually grew up to be the current Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort. The site of Jussi’s breakdown has grown into a luxury resort destination which features a variety of interesting accommodations. There are cozy log cabins, some with built-in glass nooks to better view the surrounding wilderness and auroras. There are the snow igloos which are little ice hotels where visitors can get warm in a very cold place. And perhaps most astoundingly, there is the field of glass igloos which all look like little see-through geodesic domes where nothing can obstruct your view of the Northern Lights. The resort, sitting at almost the northern tip of Europe, seems like some sci-fi outpost built on the edge of the world to survive its collapse, but really it’s just a cozy little spot to enjoy the beauty surrounding it."

The underground house of worship, called Temppeliaukion kirkko in Finnish, was designed by architect brothers Timo and Tuomo Suomalainen in the charmingly named Töölö neighborhood. On all sides of the circular church are roughly hewn stone, where sometimes water still seeps in to create miniature waterfalls. A dome coated with copper covers the rock church, with a skylight open in a belt below it to make the dome appear to hover. Even further below the church is a Cold War-era air raid shelter, which now serves as parking. Despite its cave-like appearance, Temppeliaukio Church actually has marvelous acoustics, where the sound beautifully bounces from the craggy stone. The entrance to the church is at the northside of Fredrikinkatu"

Assigned by the state the prestigious responsibility of preserving any and all printed and audiovisual material produced within Finland’s borders, the library is the gatekeeper to the country’s cultural heritage. The largest library collection in the country, the main building and annex of the complex contain over 109 kilometers of shelf space, home to over 3 million books and periodicals. Built to replace the Library of Academy of Turku after a devastating fire all but destroyed its 40,000 volume collection in 1827, the National Library of Finland has dedicated itself to collecting a vast array of heritage, its longevity allowing it to be the only scientific library whose collection includes material pre-1917, when Finland gained independence, and it has the largest, most comprehensive collection chronicling the Russian Empire existing in the world. Made up of two buildings, the Fabiania building and the Rotunda annex, the design shares influences that spread throughout the ages. The Rotunda is made up of typical Art Nouveau accents, while the main building follows the guidelines of Empire stylings. With vaulted ceilings and classical staircases throughout, each hall has its own color scheme, each lined with Greek and Roman plaster casts. The library was redesigned in 2001, but not everything is new or redone. The original iron fence in the library yard still stands, and by the south wall there sits a bronze bust of Czar Alexander I which has made the library its home since 1814. The main building of the Helsinki National Library was renovated in 2015 and opened again to the public in the spring of 2016."
32,Kemi Snow Castle,"Kemi, Finland",This fantastical icy castle is built anew every winter.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kemi-snowcastle,"Less than 100 miles below the Arctic Circle in Finnish Lapland, beauty is fleeting. Each year, the massive Snow Castle in Kemi is reconstructed in January, only to melt into muddy sludge in the spring sunlight. The castle was first created in 1995 as a gift from UNICEF, and the tradition has been going strong in the community ever since. In total, it takes over five weeks to build the castle complex, due in large part to the amount of structures that comprise it. Although Finland gets its fair share of snow, builders actually use seawater-converting snow machines to create the powerful material for their snowy medieval fortifications. Along with the castle walls, which are over twelve feet high, the area also features a hotel, art gallery, and chapel, where some people even come from across the globe to get married. Each portion of the castle is lit with colorful lights that add splendor to the naturally ethereal ice walls. Many artists come to lend their talents to the castle by creating ice sculptures throughout the waterside structure as well. Situated right on the Bothnian Bay, the castle rises up like a majestic fairytale world in the cold Finnish winter. In many ways, the Snow Castle makes the long, dark northern winters a bit more bearable for the small town of Kemi. Although the main components of the castle are consistent each winter, the Snow Castle melts in the spring and is constantly built in a new configuration. During the last 15 years, the castle has been anywhere from 13,000-20,000 square meters and has even reached three stories high. Every year is a wonderful and chilly surprise for visitors, even those who have come in the past. Whether visitors come for an icy wedding reception or a stay in a below-freezing honeymoon suite, the Snow Castle is a fantasy experience that could bring out the inner child in the most cynical of travelers. Just make sure and see it before it melts.  Located less than one kilometer from the Kemi city center."

However, what makes Götan Maailma special is the way in which all of these incredible items are displayed. The mourning hair art is on a wall, completely surrounded by other framed curios, creating an impressive homage to horror vacui. The badger has a festive little newspaper party hat tied to his head. The turtle’s ashtray and its surrounds are unexplainably covered in peanut shells. The piano has a full taxidermy reindeer regally standing on top of it. The shop’s owner, Thomas Hamberg, personally alters and adds to many of these old pieces, turning them from special antiques to unique works of art. What he doesn’t alter, he displays in strange tableaux. Though the space is small, it is easy to spend an hour looking around at the details of display in every corner.

The figures are made up of peat heads covered in straw hair and simple wooden bodies draped with colorful clothing that is changed twice a year. The immobile army seems to stand watch over the road, but despite their stationary appearance, they haven’t always stood here in this lonely field off of the highway. The work of artist Reijo Kela, the Silent People once stood in a field in a town near Helsinki named Lassila, and in 1994 were in the populated Market Place of Helsinki’s Senate Square. After a stint on the banks of the Jalonuoma river, they made their way here to Highway 5, eliciting questions and curiosity to all who pass. The truth is, the meaning of the art installation is a mystery. The artist refuses to give any sort of explanation for the figures, preferring the viewer use their own perception to define it. Many find the scarecrows sad or disturbing, evoking a forgotten people, and a popular theory is that they represent those lost during a brutal battle that took place nearby during the Winter War of 1939-1940 between the Finns and Soviet Russia.  30 km North on Highway 5 (E63) from the Suomussalmi Center."

Standing 8.5 meters tall and sporting a surprised expression and an amiable blush, Bad Bad Boy was first unveiled in August 2014 in Helsinki’s East Harbour. Part of the Mutatis Mutandis exhibition of the work of artist Tommi Toija produced by Amos Anderson Art Museum, the statue original stood adjacent to ferry terminals and waterfront tourist amusements. After the show closed in October 2016, the statue was moved to a permanent home in the city’s West Harbour, just outside the building housing the Helsinki Computer and Game Console Museum. Some photo angles might make it look like the statue is now being used to water a landscaped area, but don’t worry: It’s just pissing on the sidewalk."
37,Fortress of Suomenlinna,"Helsinki, Finland",This irregularly shaped sea fortress has defended not one but three different sovereign states.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fortress-of-suomenlinna,"There are thousands of fortresses across the world, but Suomenlinna, in Finland, is different than most in several ways. For one thing, it has defended not one but three different sovereign states since its construction in 1748: the Kingdom of Sweden, the Russian Empire, and most recently, the Republic of Finland. The fascinating history of the Fortress of Suomenlinna, also known as Sveaborg, begins in the mid 18th century. Spread across six different islands, this unusually shaped naval fort was initially built by the Swedish on the Susiluodot islands near the Helsinki harbor, following a period of war between Sweden and Russia. Work on the island fortress lasted about 40 years. At that time, the name Sveaborg was rendered into Viapori in Finnish. In 1808, during the Russo-Swedish war, the fortress fell to the Russians, and was under the rule of the Russian Imperial Government. Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland the following year, but Viapori remained under Russia’s military rule. The Russians expanded the base, and added barracks and an Orthodox church. However, over the course of the 19th century, the fortress declined in importance and was largely left to decay. During the Crimean war, it also suffered heavy bombardment. It was not repaired until the late 19th century. Then, with revolutionary unrest brewing in Russia, a mutiny erupted at Viapori in 1906. It was brought under control and the fortress defended Russia during World War I. At the end of the war, Finland achieved independence, and in 1918 Viapori was taken over by the newly founded Finnish government and renamed Suomenlinna (Castle of Finland). Under Finnish rule, renovations on the fortress began, and it was used to defend the country during WWII. Since the 1960s, defense forces moved out and renovations began to make the fortress into a residential and tourist facility. In 1991, Suomenlinna was added to Unesco’s World Heritage List. Suomenlinna is now home to approximately 800 residents and a workplace for about 400 people. The Fortress of Suomenlinna is vast, with six kilometres of defensive walls stretching over six islands. The original fortress was built with local rock. Due to the varied landscape on which the fortress was built, it deviates from conventional fortification norms. Most of the buildings that date from the earlier Swedish and Russian periods are well preserved. Suomenlinna is accessible only by water, from Helsinki. To find out about ferries, and opening hours in winter and summer for various businesses operating on Suomenlinna, please see their website for details at: https://www.suomenlinna.fi/en/ The site features walking trails, parks, many different restaurants and cafes, a playground, theatre, an art gallery, and six museums.

38,Sibelius Monument,"Helsinki, Finland",An abstract monument to a symphonic composer.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sibelius-monument,"Finnish composer Jean Sibelius once said, “Pay no attention to what the critics say. A statue has never been erected in honor of a critic.” Bringing this adage to fruition is the Sibelius Monument in Helsinki. Erected in 1967 by Finnish sculptor Eila Hiltunen, the abstract monument resembles a sound wave made from clusters of organ pipes. It consists of over 600 steel pipes unevenly grouped together at various heights, with the highest pipe reaching over 27 feet in the air. The landmark was designed to embody the spirit of Sibelius’ music, but its abstract nature caused many critics of the statue to remark that it did not directly honor the composer. To this end, a large bust of Sibelius was added at the foot of the monument so that viewers won’t be confused. A smaller version of the Sibelius Monument is located at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, but the majesty of the full-size statue is a much more fitting homage to the bombastic artist."

No matter the language, the name of the monument translates roughly to “Three-Country Cairn,” and was constructed in 1897 to settle a border dispute between the trio. With Russia aiding Finland in the negotiations, all three countries finally agreed to their borders and decided that the point where they all meet actually fell in the middle of a lake. Not that that stopped the construction of the stone. The tri-point stone itself, which features carvings from each respective side corresponding to the country it faces, sits atop a bulky yellow foundation of cement which keeps the plinth elevated no matter how high the waves or snow get. During the summer months, the cairn can be reached by crossing rickety wooden bridges that often dip into the lake, but in the winter months, it can usually just be approached on foot or sled. No matter the season, visitors are able to travel through three countries just by circling the stone, putting even the most prolific jet-setters to shame."
40,Helsinki University Museum,"Helsinki, Finland",A collection of collections ranging from dentistry to minerals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/helsinki-university-museum,"TheUniversity of Helsinki Museum is home to a collage of old collections. Visitors can discover a myriad of treasures, from a mid-19th century Finnish pharmacy to a collection of brass cartography tools to moulage (wax models) of infant diseases. The exhibit includes a few traditional collections, like the history of the University of Helsinki and the Collections of Craft Science, but the most intriguing collections are the Museum of the History of Veterinary Medicine, the Museum of the History of Dentistry, the History of Medicine and the Mineral Cabinet. Curious medical models, skull cross-sections, and torturous-looking dental contraptions are at every turn. By far the “gem” of the collection is the Mineral Cabinet. Three rooms of beautiful old mahogany cabinets display an enormous geological treasure trove. Each tiny specimen is displayed in a strange and unique way - held up by its own metal prongs, some under little bell jars, others in groupings of theme and variation. Update: As of November, 2015, the Helsinki University Museum has been moved to the main building of the university. Due to lack of space most of what was previously on display in Arppeanum is now in storage unavailable to the public. Some of it can, however, still be seen incorporated into the main exhibition.  Due to the renovation of the university's main building, the main exhibition of the University Museum is closed for the time being. The renovated basic exhibition and space for changing exhibitions will open in the university's main building at the end of 2023."
41,Veijo Rönkkönen Sculpture Garden,"Parikkala, Finland",Collection of nearly 500 concrete figures sculpted by the late Veijo Rönkkönen.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/veijo-roenkkoenen-sculpture-garden,"Over the course of almost 50 years, from the early 1960s until his death in 2010, Finnish-born artist Veijo Rönkkönen constructed nearly 500 concrete figures and displayed them on the grounds of the home he’d lived in since birth. The majority of these are human statues performing a variety of activities; one noteworthy sight features a cluster of roughly 200 figures, purportedly self-portraits of the artist, in various yoga poses. The sculptures are not particularly lifelike, but rather possess an otherworldly and at times downright sinister quality, with blank, sunken eyes, skeletal body proportions, ghoulish grins, and, in some cases, the use of real human teeth. Non-human figures include large treelike structures with cone-shaped branches. While he lived, Rönkkönen was known as something of a recluse. Despite his status as a small town paper mill worker however, he was incredibly well read, and was said to have experienced the world through the page, and the many ethnicities of his statues suggest this. Though he never discouraged visitors, he remained aloof from the tourism activities that cropped up in response to the public’s interest in his unusual collection. Despite requests, he refused to showcase his work outside his private residence. Following the artist’s death, the sculpture garden and accompanying property was purchased by Finnish businessman Reino Uusitalo who plans to refurbish the sculptures as needed and offer guided tours of the premises."
42,Salla Reindeer Park,"Salla, Finland",Quality time with reindeer in the stunning scenery of their natural Lappish habitat above the Arctic Circle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/salla-reindeer-park,"Reindeer are a way of life for many of the Fins living above the Arctic Circle in Lapland. This otherworldly landscape blanked in snow with a roof of Northern Lights overhead is dotted with wild reindeer. A collective of families of traditional reindeer herders in Salla manage one of the last wild reindeer populations in the world. They also provide a number of ways for visitors to interact with and learn more about these beautiful creatures. The Salla reindeer park offers many special excursions, ranging from reindeer-powered sleigh rides to midnight canoe trips to ice fishing and ice swimming (hopefully followed by a lengthy visit to the sauna!). However, one of the most peaceful experiences is the easy and beautiful hike through marshland and forest to the reindeer park. The trailheads are located behind the Reindeer Park building and are self-guided - all of the hikes are stunning, but follow signs to the reindeer park to get up close and personal with the regal velvet-antlered creatures. The “park” is actually a large fenced in swath of forest, where semi-tame reindeer live their quiet lives. These graceful animals are comfortable with humans, and don’t mind you coming in quite close for a photo or two. (If you see reindeer outside of this area, do not approach them, they are wild animals and have been known to charge!) Once you’ve gotten your fill of the outdoors and its flow and fauna, you can slip inside the exhibition hall and learn some finer details through the showcases use of taxidermy, vibrant photos, and audio nature sounds."
43,The Moomin House,"Naantali, Finland",A replica of the home of a famous fictional troll family.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moomin-house,"Tucked away on a small island west of Turku is a quaint blue house that would be recognized by many a literature-loving Finn. It is the house of the famous fictional Moomin family. The stories of this lovable troll family were told by the Finnish author Tove Jansson in several children’s books and comics written between 1945 and 1970. The Moomin series was a massive success and led to many spinoffs that continue up until today. The full-sized Moomin House on the island of Kailo is modeled on Jansson’s drawings in the books. It is an oddly shaped abode said to be based on an old cockle stove, a kind of fireplace that the Moomin’s ancestors lived behind. It is tall and round and painted a whimsical blueberry blue with a red cone roof. In later years Jansson made a model of the house herself, one that looked drastically different from the first. Still, the original blue house based on the books is by many still considered to be the “real” Moomin House, an opinion that was shared by the creators of the Moomin World theme park in western Finland. The quirky house is the park’s main attraction, and visitors are able to explore all five stories. Other colorful houses from the books are also reconstructed faithfully at the park.  Moomin World is open daily from mid-June to mid-August."
44,HaliPuu's Campfire Barista,"Sirkka, Finland","In the Hugging Tree Forest, lingonberry marshmallows, hot chocolates, and the best campfire lattes north of the Arctic Circle come to you.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/halipuus-campfire-barista,"Steffan Wunderink runs a truly one-of-a-kind cafe, if you can call it that. The “Campfire Barista” makes cafe-quality coffees, teas, and more over an open fire that he drags behind a snowmobile through a forest in the far northern reaches of Finland. It’s not just any forest, though. The forest belongs to his wife’s grandfather, Kaarle Raekallio. The Finnish state gave his family the forest after they lost their home during World War II. After spending decades raising the forest to be processed as timber, however, Raekallio decided to put the trees up for adoption and allow tourists to come spend time with the now dozens of trees on the property. It’s now known as Finland’s Hugging Tree Forest. It was while working as a guide in this forest, serving tourists campfire lattes, that Wunderink became the Campfire Barista. He developed a reputation around town for crafting wondrously smoky, espresso-based drinks and turning a local oddity called chaga—an antioxidant-rich mushroom that grows on birch trees—into chai lattes, all over an open fire. After a woman from the local tourism office complained about having to trek into the woods every day for her espressos, the C.F.B. bought a snowmobile and built a sled that could safely hold a fire grill. The cafe was now mobile, but as his caffeine empire refined, he needed beans that could better harness the flavor of the smoke. After asking around town for a source of organic, fair-trade coffee, he found a friend with ties to a single-estate, biodynamic coffee farm in Tamil Nadu, India. If it sounds too good to be true, the same friend also happened to operate a solar-powered coffee roaster out of a converted sea-container in town. Working directly with Wunderink, this well-found friend was able to roast beans to perfectly suit the flavor of an open fire. During winter months, you can catch Wunderink’s cafe in front of the tourism office in the center of town, in his family’s forest, or at a number of public events. Without snow in the warmer months, he’s restricted to stationary events and festivals. His menu has expanded beyond espresso-based drinks and chaga chai to selling white jasmine tea, organic rooibos tea, warm blackcurrant juice, lingonberry marshmallows you can roast over his fire, lingonberry cookies from his wife’s recipe, and chocolate dunkers—lumps of chocolate on a stick for children to dunk into hot water for hot chocolate. You may not think you’re ready for parenthood, but no one’s ever ready. Adopt a tree in Northern Finland, and you’ll know what to do when you visit. And when you visit, there’s sure to be a smoky latte waiting for you."
45,Catacombes de Paris,"Paris, France","The vast, legendary catacombs hold secrets much stranger than stacked bones.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/catacombes-de-paris,"In 2004, Parisian police were assigned to do a training exercise in a previously uncharted part of the Catacombs of Paris beneath the Palais de Chaillot. Entering the catacombs through a drain, officers first came across a sign that read “Building site, no access,” and a bit further in, a camera that actively recorded images of those who passed. As the officers approached the camera, a recording of dogs barking was triggered. The police descended deeper into the tunnels and discovered a 500-square-meter cavern with a fully equipped cinema. It included a giant cinema screen, projection equipment, chairs and a handful of films, from film noir classics to recent thrillers. Someone had turned this abandoned underground cavern into a secret amphitheater. Aside from this, in the next “room,” police discovered a fully-stocked bar and restaurant, complete with tables and chairs. The discovery left police befuddled, not to mention the professional installation of electricity and three phone lines. Three days later, police returned with experts from the French Board of Electricity to try and figure out where the power was coming from. The cables had been cut and a note lying on the floor read, “Do not try and find us.” Quarry tunnels have existed on the outskirts of Paris since Roman times. The limestone in these quarries built Paris as we know it today, and eventually, helped the city expand to the point where the quarries were directly underneath the busy metropolis. Some 200 miles of labyrinthine tunnels are believed to exist. Despite the vast length of the tunneled, underground world, only a small section of it is open to the public. This tiny portion, known as Denfert-Rochereau Ossuary, or more popularly, “The Catacombs,” has become one of the top tourist attractions in Paris. The popular site houses the skeletal remains of some six to seven million former Parisians. Not all areas of the Catacombs are open to the public. Back in the late 18th century, cemeteries were becoming over-populated. Cemeteries such as Les Innocents were so stuffed with the dead that it led to improper burials, open graves, and unearthed corpses. Neighbors began getting sick with infectious diseases due to the unhealthy conditions of the cemetery. Les Innocents was not the only cemetery that was condemned. Many other graveyards were becoming overpopulated, causing problems for the inhabitants of Paris. With tons of empty quarries, police and priests alike discreetly moved the bones to the renovated section of the tunnel over the period between 1787 and 1814.  As some notable people were buried in those “crowded” cemeteries, it is likely that their bones were transferred to the Catacombs. Some of the prominent Frenchmen whose bones might be placed in the Catacombs are Charles Perrault (famous for Little Red Riding Hood, Puss in Boots, and Cinderella), Jean de La Fontaine (known for Fables), Simon Vouet (painter), Salomon de Brosse (architect who designed Luxemburg Palace in Paris), and François Girardon (sculptor). The Catacombs became a popular attraction for royal families and the people of importance and in 1867, the area was opened to the general public. Due to their old age, the quarries not part of the official Catacombs have been deemed unsafe by Parisian officials. Nevertheless, the size and length of the tunnels make it difficult to keep secret societies, thieves, artists and the curious public from entering the dangerous network. In the 1980s, a movement was dedicated to the exploration of the tunnels. After the discovery of the secret cinema, Patrick Alk, a photographer close to the group responsible said the discovery “was a shame, but not the end of the world.” There are dozens of other meeting places just like the one the police discovered in the mysterious labyrinth. He concluded, saying, “you guys have no idea what’s down there.” Due to vandalism and the theft of several skulls, the catacombs were closed from October 2009 through December of the same year. With the reopening of the site comes additional security and bag checks upon exiting.  The Catacombs no longer sells tickets at the door, they must be purchased online up to one week in advance. Another tip would be to go there in the low season and outside of French School holidays. For safety and preservation reasons, it is forbidden to bring suitcases and luggage to the Catacombs. There are no cloakroom facilities on the spot. It is strongly suggested that you do not attempt to explore the catacombs on your own (it is illegal)."
46,Père Lachaise Cemetery,"Paris, France","France's most famous cemetery, with some of its most curious tombs.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pere-lachaise-cemetery,"Originally established by Napoleon, the cemetery languished in obscurity until its directors conducted an elaborate publicity campaign culminating in their claiming the remains of Molière. After this, citizens clamored to be buried with the stars, so to speak, and demand skyrocketed. Today, the cemetery is home to several notable graves. That of Oscar Wilde is worth visiting; traditionally, devoted fans kiss the grave while wearing lipstick. Also notable is Jim Morrison, whose grave is a constant source of strife. Routinely, full bottles of Jim Beam, bouquets of roses, and other mementos mori are left as offerings to the singer. The grave itself and the immediate area was once, long ago, strewn with graffiti, but it was cleaned up by Jim’s parents in 1994. Sadly, fanatics also used to chip pieces off the concrete liner of the grave prompting the cemetery staff to order the placement of a steel fence around the grave and increase the number of guards watching visitors. Additionally, vandals have defaced other graves with arrows pointing towards Morrison’s. Aside from its famous inhabitants, the cemetery is a landmark simply for its design and atmosphere, and one of France’s most interesting sites. Another interesting crypt is the one of Allan Kardec, considered the father of Spiritism — as compared to Spiritualism — in France. His real name was Hypolyte Leon Denizard Rivail. The pseudonym originated from mediumistic communications. Both the names “Allan” and “Kardec” were said to have been his names in previous incarnations. He is best known for his classic, Le Livre des Esprits (The Spirits’ Book), first published in 1856. Within this book is expounded a new theory of human life and destiny. The Spirits’ Book is based on trance communications received. The automatic scripts brought forward a thorough and intriguing doctrine of reincarnation. There’s also the tomb of Robertson, the stage name of Étienne-Gaspard Robert, an innovator in phantasmagoria in the late 18th century in Paris, whose monument is decorated with skulls and bas-reliefs showing a crowd being menaced by his illusions of skeletons and ghouls, as well as a hot air balloon ride as Robertson was also an aficionado of early aviation. Two balloonists, Joseph Croce-Spinelli and Théodore Sivel, are remembered with a monument that shows them resting hand-in-hand beneath a draped shroud. The two perished on a balloon ascent on April 15, 1875, at around 28,000 feet in an attempt to beat the standing record and experiment with the use of oxygen at such heights. Some other tombs of notable people to be seen here are that of Frederic Chopin, Honore de Balzac, Edith Piaf, Miguel Angel Asturias (Guatemalan novelist), Gertrude Stein, Georges Cuvier (famous naturalist), Maria Callas (famous opera singer), Max Ernst (surrealist painter), Marie- Madeleine Fourcade (leader of the WWII French resistance), and Amadeo Modigliani (famous Italian artist).  The Père Lachaise Metro station is not actually the closest to the cemetery entrance; it is about half a kilometer away. For a closer Metro stop, use the Philippe Auguste stop on line 2. The free map at the main office (near the Philippe Auguste metro) isn't the best guide for the cemetery & is actually fairly difficult to read, lacking the detail to navigate the cemetery's many paths. Many different maps are available online and it probably isn't too hard to find one with more detail. Just outside the cemetery, near the Père Lachaise metro station there are usually vendors that sell better maps than the one at the main office -- for a few euros, you can get a more accurate map & have a souvenir of the trip. As the cemetery is built on a slight hill, the preferred Metro stop is Gambetta, which is two blocks away. One can work one's way downhill, rather than climbing upwards."
47,Bibliothèque nationale de France (National Library of France),"Paris, France",This massive library holds what was once largest book collection in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bibliotheque-nationale-de-france,"The massive Bibliothèque nationale de France is one of the grandest and most storied collections of printed material in the world. It’s also home to two marvels of French Renaissance cartography. The Bibliothèque nationale de France can trace its origin all the way back to 1368 when it was founded by Charles V. Despite being moved multiple times and having portions of the collection dispersed, it remained the largest library in the world until the late 1800’s, when other collections surpassed its numbers. The facilities have been rebuilt and expanded in modern times and renovated throughout, leaving it as still one of the largest libraries in the world with over ten million titles. It houses books on the arts, law, economics, languages and literature, science and technology, humanities, philosophy and more. The library also houses numerous collections from antiquity including over 5,000 Greek manuscripts. The library also has an extensive collection of antique coins, including Greek, Roman, and French. Visitors attend the library for a bit of historical tourism as well as to check out the books. Among most popular attractions on display are Louis XIV’s globes. They lived at Versailles until the French Revolution, after which they moved from place to place before finally settling permanently at the Bibliothèque nationale."
48,Petite Ceinture,"Paris, France",Abandoned railway line circling the city of Paris.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/petite-ceinture,"The Petite Ceinture railway circling through the city of Paris served urban travelers from 1862 to 1934 before being abandoned. Predating the Paris Métro, the “little belt” railroad connected the main train stations and provided needed fortification for the city. Construction was started in 1852 under the Empire of Napoléon III and Baron Haussmann, the influential civic planner. The 20th century sprawl of Paris beyond the Petite Ceinture and the success of the Métro eventually made the circular railway obsolete. Certain stretches are now overgrown with over 200 species of flora and fauna, vibrant with colorful flowers in the spring months and greenery against vivid graffiti and street art. Bridges, tunnels, and the original tracks remain mostly untouched, hidden just beyond the streets and neighborhoods of the outer arrondissements. A section in the 16th arrondissement was incorporated into the RER regional network system in 1988, and in 2008 a section between the Porte d’Auteuil and the Gare de la Muette was opened to pedestrians as a nature trail. Several other sections are now open to the public, in the 16th, the 15th, and the 12th arrondissements. Although the remaining parts are closed, their accessibility from nine arrondissements makes it popular with urban explorers. The catacombs of Paris even have their easiest entry point from one of the tunnels on the Petite Ceinture. A good way to see some old train stations is to enter via Villa du Bel Air and exit at the old Gare de Charonne before the tunnel. The majority of the tracks are still owned and managed by the SNCF and are still in working order, notably the sections that link the Gare de Bercy with the Gare de Nord and Gare de l’Est in the east of the city. City officials in cooperation with SNCF have begun a program to open up parts of the Petite Ceinture to the communities it runs through. The project is a long term undertaking but has already seen several parts turned into walkways and parks, while still preserving the biodiversity and heritage of the sites. A few dozen kilometers are reserved for pedestrians at the moment. However, keep in mind that some sections are not safe, thus it’s better to walk with a company.  Points of entry on the edges of the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th arrondissements. Easy access at Villa du Bel Air near Porte de Vincennes. If you plan to walk through any of the tunnels be warned they can be very long, quickly become completely dark, and are full of rats. You will need an extremely powerful flashlight to see where you are going and what you're walking on. It can become very rough underfoot and your phone light simply will not do! Opening times at the official entry points vary according to the sections of the railway trail and the season. The trail usually opens between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and closes between 7.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m."
49,59 Rivoli,"Paris, France",Notorious artist squat renovated into legal studios.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/59-rivoli,"The mid-1800s Haussmann era building at 59 Rivoli was an artist squat for years before being renovated by the city and returned to a collective of artists. After Crédit Lyonnais abandoned the space, a group of artists called “KGB” (standing for Kalex, Gaspard, and Bruno) claimed the building in 1999. Despite the dead pigeons and syringes that littered the deteriorating structure, the group was soon hosting exhibitions and performances under the name “Chez Robert, électrons libres.” Although the space was illegally occupied, by 2001 it was getting 40,000 visitors a year, making it the third most visited center for contemporary art in Paris. In 2006, the city of Paris acquired 59 Rivoli as part of its effort to bring legality and building safety to popular illegal artist squats. After renovations, it reopened in 2009 with studios for over 30 artists who pay minimal rent. The six stories of 59 Rivoli and its exhibits are free and open to the public. While the wild art that once covered the facade is now much more tame, there are still whimsical and expressive installations that turn up on the stone exterior.  Located on Rue de Rivoli in one of the largest shopping areas in Paris."
50,Shakespeare and Company,"Paris, France","This iconic Parisian bookstore doubles as the ""Tumbleweed Hotel"" for traveling writers.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shakespeare-and-company,"In 1951, an eccentric American named George Whitman opened a bookstore with the hope of creating a literary hub in the heart of Paris. Whitman, a fervent communist, decided he would welcome all writers needing a place to stay in Paris as his own personal guests at the bookstore. Painted over an inner door is the bookshop’s motto “be kind to strangers lest they be angels in disguise,” an endearing welcome for all those with a heart astray. The requirements are simple. On a first-come, first-serve basis, these guests—whom Whitman dubbed the “Tumbleweeds”—must write a biography and help out for an hour or two a day around the bookstore. With 13 beds concealed as bookshelves during the day, Shakespeare and Company has become a utopia for the wanderlust-stricken traveler, looking for a place to stay in Paris. Whitman calls the bookstore “a socialist utopia masquerading as a bookstore.” Originally the shop was named Le Mistral, but on the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare’s birth in 1964, Whitman renamed it Shakespeare and Company. The name is an homage to the bard, as well as to a legendary bookstore of the same name, which was owned by Sylvia Beach and frequented by Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and other writers. The original Shakespeare and Company on the Rue de l’Odeon closed during World War II, but Whitman’s shop picked up the mantle. Today, over 50 years later, Whitman’s daughter, Sylvia—also named in honor of Sylvia Beach—has taken over the day-to-day management of the store, but the Tumbleweed tradition still lives on with as many as 40,000 people having slept in the shop over the years. Regular activities that occur in the bookshop are Sunday tea, poetry readings, and writers’ meetings. In the 1950s, the shop served as a base for many of the writers of the Beat Generation, such as Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, and William S. Burroughs. Years later the adjacent building was purchased by Shakespeare & Co., and now functions as a café and bistro featuring literature-themed menu items to budding writers. The library has also been featured in Richard Linklater’s film Before Sunset (2004) and in Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris (2011).  Shakespeare and Company is located on the Left Bank of Paris, opposite the Notre Dame cathedral, on 37 rue de la Bûcherie in the Latin Quarter. The bookstore is open daily from 10 am to 10 pm, while the adjacent cafe is open from 9:30 am to 7 pm (8 pm on weekends). Shakespeare and Company can get crowded (especially on weekends) so it is advised to visit the bookstore either earlier in the day or later in the evening to avoid lines. For those keen on staying at Shakespeare and Company as a tumbleweed, you'll have to get in touch with the bookshop directly via e-mail, with the subject line ""Tumbleweed"" to plan your accommodations in advance."
51,Montmartre Cemetery,"Paris, France",A horde of stray cats rule in this secluded Parisian cemetery under a bridge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/montmartre-cemetery,"Lying at the foot of Montmartre in the 18th arrondissement of Paris is a secluded cemetery. Whilst not as sought out as its more illustrious contemporaries, Pere Lachaise to the East or Montparnasse to the South, Montmarte is a leafy and idyllic final resting place for many of the artists who lived in the famous neighbourhood. Built below street level, a large part of the cemetery lies underneath the busy Rue Caulaincourt, giving it a secluded air. Once grand mausoleums covered in cobwebs lie nestled below the wrought iron blue bridge. Montmartre cemetery opened for business in 1825, on the site of an abandoned quarry that had been used as a makeshift mass grave in the Revolution. And for many of the renowned artists who worked and lived on Montmartre, it became their final home. Degas, Heinrich Heine, Berlioz, Alexander Dumas, Francois Truffaut, Emile Zola and Adolphe Sax, inventor of the saxophone are all buried in the cemetery. Montmartre is a peaceful and serene haven from the bustling city that overshadows it, but it is also home to it’s own little community: a large group of cats. No one is quite sure where they came from, but dozens and dozens of cats live amongst the mausoleums, quietly sunning themselves on the marble tombstones and keeping watch over their long forgotten inhabitants."
52,House of Nicolas Flamel,"Paris, France",The oldest stone house in Paris was built by its most famous alchemist.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-nicolas-flamel,"Strange symbols adorn the architecture at 51 rue de Montmorency in Paris. The house was in fact built by the city’s most famous alchemist, who many believe achieved great wealth through his discovery of the Philosopher’s Stone. Nicolas Flamel was born sometime in the 14th century and worked for most of his life as a bookseller. However, many believe that he happened upon an arcane text that revealed the secrets of turning ordinary metals into gold. It is true that Flamel was a great philanthropist, but whether or not this wealth came from alchemy is the stuff of debatable legends. Nevertheless, Flamel’s name has become inextricable from alchemy, and he’s seen as one of its great practitioners by many interested in the transformation of elements into greater forms. The house on Montmorency Street was built by Flamel in 1407 and is now the oldest stone house in Paris. It’s here where Flamel is said to have carried out his experiments in alchemy. Flamel died in the 15th century, but not before designing his own tombstone with its own symbology that is now on display at the Musée de Cluny. The church he was originally buried in, the Church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, has since been torn down, leaving only the looming Tour Saint-Jacques. A street by the tower has been named for Flamel, which intersects with one named for his wife Pernelle. As for the former home of Flamel, it is now an atmospheric restaurant, appropriately taking the name Auberge Nicolas Flamel.  The building is still the same from the outside, but the interior has been converted into a restaurant, Auberge Nicolas Flamel."
53,Rue Crémieux,"Paris, France","This charming cobbled backstreet is the most Instagramable street in Paris, much to the residents' annoyance.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rue-cremieux,"At one time this enchanting little cobbled street, hidden away in the 12th arrondissement, was a “secret place” few people knew about. These days, however, Rue Crémieux is an increasingly sought out haunt for fashion photographers, filmmakers, and people looking for something uniquely suited the color-saturated world of Instagram. In many respects, this quaint throughway between Rue de Lyon and Rue de Bercy doesn’t really feel like Paris at all and is perhaps more reminiscent of Portobello Road in London’s Notting Hill, or Burano in Venice. Amid the colorful façades, trompes l’œil paintings, and shuttered windows, are window boxes and terracotta pots filled with lush plants that add to the feeling you have somehow escaped Paris for a moment. This is a residential street, albeit a very short one, but the homes are not large. In fact, on one side of the street, the building is little more than one room in depth. An interesting fact that few visitors to Rue Crémieux probably realize is that the street is actually named after a lawyer. Jokes aside, it was renamed in 1897 in dedication to Adolphe Crémieux, who defended the human rights of the Jewish people living in France. Instagram has made Rue Crémieux so famous that residents have felt increasingly under siege from visitors who forget that the street is a residential neighborhood. In early 2019, residents tired with the noise, pointing lenses, and inconsiderate tourists asked the city of Paris to erect gates closing the street to visitors on evenings and weekends. One particularly understanding resident of Rue Cremieux told the BBC that she understands people want to visit the street and take pictures, but she asked visitors to “do it with some common courtesy and respect for property owners, fellow visitors, and the environment.”  Remember, this is a residential street, so be respectful of the occupants' privacy."
54,Mont Saint-Michel,"Mont Saint-Michel, France","This 1,300 year old monastery built atop a single rock was once only accessible depending on the whims of the tide.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mont-saint-michel,"Set atop a solid rock in the middle of a bay, the abbey and surrounding town was originally only accessible as the tides allowed. Although subsequent development has allowed 24 hours access to the island, an in-progress dam will restore the rock to its previous state as entirely surrounded by water during high tide. Regardless of whether there exists a 24 hour bridge to the rock or not, Mont Saint-Michel remains a singularly beautiful structure atop a amazing geological formation. During the day take a tour of the abbey and the (tiny) surrounding town. Even better, stay overnight in one of the hotels and you’ll have the run of the grounds as the island empties to only a handful of residents after dark. The abbey was originally built to the schematics of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, after both an abbot and a count had had visions of St. Michael. Historians suggest, though, that this was merely a scheme to increase tourism into the area. This place also is of interest for those of us, who are into the Arthurian mythology, as Thomas Malory claims that this is the place where King Arthur himself battled a virgin devouring giant, before going off on his campaign against the emperor of Rome.  To avoid the crowds, try going during the low season (November through March)."

The museum, which opened in 1996, is sourced from the private collection of Jean-Paul Favand, an actor and dealer of antiquities. It includes such vintage carnival items as wooden carousels, fair stalls, German swings, and a Hooghuys Organ. Best of all, you can play a carnival game and even ride on some of the rides, such as the “Manège vélocipédique” from 1897, a carousel of bicycles powered by the pedaling of its riders. The museum is open only by reservation or by attending one of the scheduled seasonal tours. Reservations for the tour need to be made in advanced (a week ahead of time is optimal). Reservations can be made online or by phone. Twice a year, the museum is open to self-guided tours and shows every half hour for European Heritage Days (the third weekend of September) and Le Festival du Merveilleux (December 26 to the end of the year). Tours are one hour and 30 minutes and come with an optional English pamphlet for non-French speakers."
56,I Love You Wall,"Paris, France","Paris' linguistic guide to the international language of, yes, love.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/le-mur-des-je-t-aime,"Spanning 416 square feet, the I Love You Wall (Le mur des je t’aime) in Paris’s Jehan-Rictus Square was created by two artists as a rendezvous location for lovers and a lasting monument to eternal adoration. Covered in 612 lava tiles, the wall features the words “I love you” in 311 languages, including all 192 languages of the United Nations. The artwork was created by Frédéric Baron and Claire Kito, who originally collected the phrase in notebooks by knocking on the doors of embassies and asking their neighbors until they had collected more than 300 languages, all expressing the powerful sentiment of love.  The wall is open for viewing Monday through Friday starting at 8:00 AM. Closing times vary based on the season. The closest subway station is Abbesses."
57,Museum of the History of Medicine,"Paris, France",One of the oldest medical collections in Europe focusing on rare surgical instruments.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-the-history-of-medicine,"The Museum of the History of Medicine (Musée d’Histoire de la Médecine) in Paris has collections dating back to the 18th century celebrating the evolution of medical instruments. The collections, with around 1,500 objects, are some of the oldest in Europe and are especially strong in medical instruments for surgery and physiology, although there are also anatomical specimens and art related to surgery. The exhibition in the museum is arranged chronologically to take visitors through the history of surgical devices, such as those for trepanning and even those surgical bags used at Waterloo (all of which will make you glad to live in the modern era of anesthesia and less menacing metal instruments). The prized objects include the autopsy tools used on Napoleon, and an intricate wood model dating to 1799 for anatomy study that has hundreds of movable parts. The museum is located in the Université Paris Descartes on the second floor in a beautiful space dating to 1905 and, after having undergone a restoration, is open to the public. Do be aware that the small entry fee of 4€ is payable by cash only."
58,Paris Point Zero,"Paris, France",The very center of Paris is surrounded by a bevy of strange good luck rituals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paris-point-zero,"Just outside of Notre Dame Cathedral embedded in the concrete of the public square is a small geographic marker from which the distance from Paris to all other places are judged. But rather than some dry symbol of measurement the spot known as Paris Point Zero has attracted a surprising number of local rituals. One of a number of so-called “kilometre zeroes” around the world, Paris Point Zero marks the supposedly exact center of the city or country. All other locations are thought to be measured as a distance radiating from this point. Paris’ center is marked by an octagonal brass plate that is set rather unremarkably into the concrete of the square. due to the marker’s low profile, some visitors have a hard time even finding it, but often times when they do, it has become customary to pay respects in any of a number of ways. Many of the customs performed on the site, are of the wish-granting variety, be it spinning in a circle on one foot atop the marker to gain your heart’s desire or kissing a loved one above the plate to ensure a eternal devotion. Sometimes the slightly concave marker can even be found to be filled with coins thanks to the popular tradition of using the point as a sort of wishing well. Others still pay pilgrimage to the site when they feel that they have experienced Paris to its fullest, using it as a proverbial period in the story of their journey. Undoubtedly there are countless other rituals of devotion to the very heart of Paris, but however it is expressed, this geographic marker likely receives more love than most around the world. Update May 2019: Because of the fire of Notre Dome Cathedral in April 2019, this location is now inaccessible and may be for a while. It would appear that the Paris Point Zero is also the same location the Notre Dame Christmas tree (donated by Sweden) is stationed during the Christmas holiday season, rendering the Zero point obscured entirely."
59,The Room of Endangered and Extinct Species,"Paris, France",A haunting collection of the vanished and disappearing natural world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-room-of-endangered-and-extinct-species-paris-france,"Holding 257 rare specimens, La Salle des Espèces Menacées et des Espèces Disparues (The Room of Endangered and Extinct Species) is a glimpse into natural worlds that human progress has pushed to endangerment or extinction. The wood-lined room is one of the original galleries of the Grande Galerie de l’Évolution. It is kept cold and dark, with most light coming from the glass and wood display cases. The specimens, in various states of completion from whole taxidermy examples to single pressed branches, represent animals and plants that have been completely extinguished, and others that are fading from existence. There are disappearing animals like the Aye-aye, a large nocturnal lemur from Madagascar; the critically endangered Sumatran Tiger; and a preserved Coelacanth, the ancient fish long believed to be extinct that resurfaced in South Africa in 1938, later to be found in the Comoros and Indonesia. A Barbary lion and Cape lion, both extinct in the wild, snarl and stare from their shared glass case in the center of the room. Many of the taxidermy animals, skeletons, and other specimens are the only examples of extinct creatures. The gallery contains the sole complete black emu skeleton and only complete mounted Schomburgk’s Deer, chased for its ornate antlers in Thailand. There is the extinct quagga, a zebra with stripes only on its head; a Rodrigues Giant Tortoise; a dried Cry Violet; a pinned Xerces Blue butterfly; a Tasmanian Tiger; one of two known specimens of the Santa Lucian Giant Rice Rat; a mounted Bluebuck skin; one of only seven preserved Hawaii ʻOo, a bird hunted for its striking yellow feathers; one of three Seychelles giant tortoises; and one of ten known specimens of the Martinique Muskrat, a species that met its final end when it chose the Mount Pelée volcano as its last refuge, perishing in the 1902 eruption. Alongside these relics of natural history is a gold clock made for Marie-Antoinette by Robert Robin, Louis XVI’s clockmaker. It was confiscated during the French Revolution and still chimes through the stillness of the gallery. In addition to the Room of Endangered and Extinct Species, the Grande Galerie de l’Evolution extends to 3,000 specimens in its central atrium alone, and 7,000 in the adjoining rooms. It is one of three museums at the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle complex in the Jardin des Plantes. On the third floor.

If so, Un Regard Moderne is the cathedral of international counterculture. Blossoming decades ago in rue Git-le-Coeur (literally “The Street Where your Heart Lay Down”), where Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs used to have their parisian stronghold, this bibliophilia treasure box is filled up to the ceiling with the most subversive, intriguing, and unusual art books, essays and comics that have inspired generations of bookworms and eye hedonists. Named by owner Jacques Noel after the French avant-garde graphics collective Bazooka, this bookstore remains an active crossroad for independent publishers, underground artists and musicians - or anyone that still believes books are magnetic artifacts capable of transforming your mind. The store itself, a two-room shop that can’t hold more than five people at the same time, gives the eerie feeling of being lost in Escher Daedalic structures arranged in a way that are almost anarchic. Oustider art, surrealism, fetishism, Japan import, graphic design, science fiction, fanzines, censored books …. No matter what your main interest is, you’ll always find a billion other things that will blow your mind and maybe change your life.

61,Vardzia Cave Monastery,Georgia,Underground monastery and fortress.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vardzia,"The underground halls of the “mountain queen,” dug out of the solid rock, Vardzia looks like it was taken directly from the pages of Lord of the Rings. In reality it is a cave-palace-monastery built not by dwarfs, but by Georgians in the Caucasus for their fabled queen Tamar. In desperate circumstances people are often driven to perform feats of mythical proportions. In the late 1100s the medieval kingdom of Georgia was resisting the onslaught of the Mongol hordes, the most devastating force Europe had ever seen. Queen Tamar ordered the construction of this underground sanctuary in 1185, and the digging began, carving into the side of the Erusheli mountain, located in the south of the country near the town of Aspindza. When completed this underground fortress extended 13 levels and contained 6000 apartments, a throne room and a large church with an external bell tower. It is assumed that the only access to this stronghold was via a hidden tunnel whose entrance was near the banks of Mtkvari river. The outside slope of the mountain was covered with fertile terraces, suitable for cultivation, for which an intricate system of irrigation was designed. With such defenses, natural and man made, the place must have been all but impregnable to human forces. Alas, the glorious days of Vardzia didn’t last for very long. Though safe from the Mongols, mother nature was a different story altogether. In 1283, only a century after its construction, a devastating earthquake literally ripped the place apart. The quake shattered the mountain slope and destroyed more than two-thirds of the city, exposing the hidden innards of the remainder. However despite this, a monastery community persisted until 1551 when it was raided and destroyed by Persian Sash Tahmasp. Today the place is maintained by a small group of zealous monks. About three hundred apartments and halls remain visitable and in some tunnels the old irrigation pipes still bring drinkable water.  To get to Vardzia from Tbilisi, you must first transfer through Akhaltsikhe. Marshrutka vans for Akhaltsikhe depart from Didube Station every 40-60 minutes or when full starting from 8 a.m. The journey takes around 3 hours and tickets cost 10 GEL. From Akhaltsikhe, there are four daily marshrutka vans to Vardzia leaving the bus station at 9 a.m., 10 a.m., and 3 p.m. Travel time is over an hour, and the fare cost 5 GEL. Tickets must be purchased inside the station before you board. A taxi from Akhaltsikhe to Vardzia costs around 50 GEL You can usually find drivers waiting outside the bus station."
62,Uplistsikhe Cave Town,Georgia,Ancient rock-hewn town that witnessed key events of Georgian history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/uplistsikhe-cave-town,"Located in Eastern Georgia, Uplistsikhe (literally “Lord’s Fortress“) is an abandoned rock-hewn town, which once have played an important role in Georgian history. The place was founded in the late Bronze Age, around 1000 BC, and continued to be inhabited until 13th century AD. Between the 6th century BC and the 11st century AD, Uplistsikhe was one of the most important political and religious centers of pre-Christian Kartli – one of the predecessors of the Georgian state. Archaeologists have unearthed numerous temples and findings relating to a sun goddess, worshipped prior to the arrival of Christianity. When Christianity arrived in Georgia, the city lost importance in favor of the new centers of Christian culture, most notably Mtskheta and Tbilisi. Nevertheless, life continued in Uplistsikhe, Christian structures have been built, and for a short time, Christianity and the old faith coexisted in the city. After the Arab conquest of the royal city of Tbilisi, the town’s second heyday began, when Uplistsikhe became the residence of the kings of Kartli, during which the town grew to a size of around 20,000 people, evolving into an important caravan trading post. When Tbilisi was recaptured in 1122, Uplistsikhe faced an immediate and rapid decline, culminated by the destruction of large parts of the city during the Mongol conquest in the 13th century, and the subsequent abandonment of the rest of the town. The cave town can be divided into a lower, a central and an upper area, covering an area of almost 40,000 square meters. The central area, which contains most of the rock-cut structures, is connected to the lower area by narrow tunnel. Most of the rock-cut structures are without any decorative elements, aside from some of the larger structures, which contain some stone carvings. At the top of the complex is a Christian stone basilica, dating from the 10th century. The rock-cut structures include a large hall, called Tamaris Darbazi, pagan places of sacrifice, dwellings, as well as functional buildings, like a pharmacy, a bakery, a prison, and even an amphitheater. The rock-cut structures are connected by tunnels, while other tunnels had the purpose of an emergency escape route. Uplistsikhe is remarkable for the unique combination of styles from rock-cut cultures of the region, most notably from Cappadocia (in modern Turkey) and Northern Iran. Most of the unearthed artifacts can be seen at the National Museum in Tbilisi. You can take a train or marshrutka from Tbilisi to Gori and then get cab to take you to the cave, wait for you and bring you back to town. But negotiate rate in advance."
63,Leaning Tower of Tbilisi,"Tbilisi, Georgia",The charmingly disheveled clock tower of Tbilisi's puppet theater.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leaning-tower-tbilisi,"The leaning tower of Tbilisi is one of the city’s most unusual buildings. Tucked into a side street of old town, it truly is a bizarre structure, with a tower on the perpetual brink of falling down, and only a steel beam holding the tower in place. A huge clock sits in the middle of the disheveled tower, with a leaning column on its side. While an incredibly odd sight, it’s not an old structure. It is a modern tower, attached to the puppet theatre of renowned puppeteer Rezo Gabriadze. He himself is the brainchild behind the structure, as well as the building to its side, which houses the actual theatre. Gabriadze built the theatre himself over a timespan of thirty years, reusing old pieces from abandoned structures of the old town, and from buildings destroyed following a major earthquake. The weird clock tower was added in 2011, after a four-year construction phase. It’s hard not to fall in love with the playful, naive architecture of the tower. This is especially true when on the hour, a window opens at the small balcony at the top, and a mannequin of an angel strikes the bell. Below the clock, a screen opens and shows the circle of life: boy meets girl, marriage, childbirth and funeral. Aside from being a magnificent and truly unique structure, the tower is also an impressive statement against soulless urban modernization, and the semi-identical glass-and-steel structures that continue to pop up in nearly every city on the planet – including Tbilisi. While modern structures continue to appear in Tbilisi, large parts of the old town are in a shocking state of disrepair, and while a lot of reconstruction work has been carried out, the city’s government seems to be more eager to set modern landmarks than preserve the old ones."
64,Katskhi Pillar,"Katskhi, Georgia",Small church on top of a huge rock column.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/katskhi-pillar,"The Katskhi Pillar abruptly rises 40 meters from the hills of Central Georgia and looks similar to a giant’s club. Its mythical aura made it a place of worship since humans settled this area. Prior to the arrival of Christianity, the pillar served as a pagan holy place for a long time and was most likely used for fertility rites. In the 4th century, Georgia adapted Christianity as its state religion, as the second country in the world after Armenia. Slowly, and following a general world trend, Christianity replaced pagan places of worship with Christian ones to consolidate the new beliefs. Thus, the Katskhi Pillar became the site of a small church first built in the seventh century. The church that sits atop the pillar resembles the practice of the Stylites who were early Christian ascetics who prayed on top of wooden pillars. Following the lead of the much-revered Saint Simeon Stylites, who sat atop a pillar for almost 40 years, these pious Christians tortured their bodies and devoted their spirits to their religion. The Katskhi Pillar also bears a striking resemblance to the famous Greek monasteries of Meteora. The Georgian Orthodox Church is currently building a new small church at the top of the rock column, which can be reached via a combination of scaffolding at the lower half and a vertigo-inducing iron ladder at the upper half of the pillar. The earthly remains of a believer, who died atop the pillar at an unknown date, are kept at the contemporary church building. Women are not allowed to climb to the top.

65,Davit Gareja Cave Monastery,"Udabno, Georgia",Rock-hewn monastery complex with hundreds of cave structures tucked away into the mountainside.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/davit-gareja-cave-monastery,"Davit Gareja is a rock-hewn Orthodox monastery in the Kakheti region of Georgia. It is not far from the  border with Azerbaijan. The climate is often described as a semidesert. Hundreds of cells, churches, refectories, and living quarters have been hewn into the rock face at the steep slopes of Mount Gareja. Saint David, an Assyrian Monk, founded the monastic complex in the 6th century and it was steadily expanded during the following centuries. The monastery complex has been an important center of religious and cultural activity for hundreds of years and this reached its height between the 11th and 13th centuries. The monastery complex was always closely linked with the royalty of Georgia, but the downfall of the Georgian monarchy did not put an end to the monastic activities at Davit Gareja. Neither did the attacks by the Mongols in the 13th century, or the attacks of the Persians in the 17th century. It wasn’t until the Bolshevik takeover in 1921 that the monastery was closed down and became deserted. During the late Soviet years, the monastery became a training ground for the Soviet War in Afghanistan and this caused considerable damage to the murals within the complex and caused a public outcry among Georgians. When Georgia restored its independence, the monastery was revived and it is once again a center of religious activity as well as an important destination for pilgrims and tourists alike. The inside of the cave structures has been covered with numerous murals and fresco paintings, a number of which have survived the test of time. Since the Soviet border-drawing process did not have any regard for cultural borders, especially when religious heritage was involved, today parts of the monastery complex are technically located within Azerbaijan and this has sparked a minor border dispute between the two countries. Given the religious and cultural importance of Davit Gareja, Georgians have stated it to be unacceptable that the site would be split between two countries, and have offered a land swap, but a final agreement has yet to be achieved. As of January 2021: The upper Udabno Monastery remains closed due to the ongoing border dispute. Visitors can still explore Lavra Monastery, the lower part of the complex, but the hiking trail and ridge, frescoes, and upper church are off-limits.  After a hike up the mountain next to the monastery, you can see views of the Azerbaijani border. When climbing down the other side of the mountain, you come across the caves built into the side of the mountain. These caves contain traces of fresco paintings, some of which are fully intact. Some may argue that this is more interesting than the monastery itself. Since the area is not frequented by tourists, you can also see some interesting wildlife. Snakes (some venomous) are present in the summer months so take care. The nearest village is Udabno. You can take a marshutka there and hitchhike to the monastery, or more conveniently, use the Gareji Line transfer service, which leaves from Freedom Square in Tbilisi at 11 AM daily during the high season. For more information, see their Facebook page. The road to Davit Gareja is part asphalt and part rubble. A vehicle with high clearance is recommended but a 4WD is not required. The hike up the mountain is quite steep in parts. Wear proper footwear, and bring water and your own food. There is a new Visitors Center at the site with clean toilets (50 tetri), vending machines, and a shop selling products made by the resident monks."
66,Gergeti Trinity Church,Georgia,Take respite inside this jaw-dropping church while climbing the volcano where Georgia's Prometheus was once chained.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gergeti-trinity-church,"Looming large among Georgia’s folk culture is Mount Kazbek, one of the highest peaks in the Caucuses, thanks to its intertwining threat to human life with the anguish inflicted on a beloved—albeit capricious—version of Prometheus. According to Georgian folklore, a hero by the name of Amirani stole fire from the hands of the gods as a gift to his fellow mortals. In punishment, the Prometheus-esque figure was chained high atop Mount Kazbek’s perilous slopes. Scholars estimate the nearest spot to his imprisonment is likely that of the current Orthodox hermitage, located inside the Bethlehem (locally: “Betlemi”) Cave at more than 13,000 feet up the mountain. Despite a titanic mythos, Kazbek’s draw remains more tantalizing to mountaineers than literary and history buffs. The dormant stratovolcano is a mountaineer’s delight with a prominence of 7,720 feet that is relatively easy to access, making Georgia’s third-highest mountain the perfect pairing of accessible and challenging among the legendarily rugged Caucasus range. Along the way, many trekkers are given respite within the walls of a 14th-century Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic church. Located a less-than-two-hour hike straight up the mountainside from the nearest town, the holy refuge known as Gergeti Trinity consists of little more than a cross-cupola church and a separate bell tower. Though briefly abandoned during the Soviet years, the enclave seems frozen in time. In the face of such astounding beauty, Gergeti Trinity’s modest exterior suddenly becomes all the more breathtaking for its simplicity, made all the more so for the benevolence of its residents taking in those sometimes strident folk who seem hellbent on following in the footsteps of castigated heroes they’ve long since cast aside."
67,Batumi McDonald's,"Batumi, Georgia",Fast food feels like fine dining at this award-winning modern Georgian building.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/batumi-mcdonalds,"The Georgian seaport of Batumi, also called the “Las Vegas of the Black Sea,” is known for its ornate churches and state buildings. But it has fine examples of modern architectural splendor, as well, including a McDonald’s so fanciful that that it might be the only fast food building to have won awards for architectural brilliance. Designed by architect Giorgi Khmaladze, the futuristic glass structure juts out into the sky, like a spaceship ready for take-off. Its bold edges are softened by a reflective pool streaming along its perimeter. The polyhedronal structure, encased in a cantilevered glass shell, was awarded the Best Commercial Building of 2014 by the architecture website ArchDaily. The familiar golden arches of the McDonald’s logo look diminutive against the backdrop of this towering edifice. Apart from the spectacular architecture there’s more to this McDonald’s that first meets the eye. It’s also built right on top of a gas station. But guests dining inside won’t notice anything of the gas pumps right next to them. A sloping garden offers green respite in the dining area, while also serving as the canopy over the gas station. With the space’s pool and lush vegetation, it’s hard to believe you’re in the midst of a busy city, while the experience of chomping down a Big Mac in this McDonald’s makes fast food feel like fine dining.  The Batumi McDonald's is located in downtown Batumi, right near the beach and the Batumi Mall."
68,Ali and Nino,"Batumi, Georgia",A literally moving statue of stacked metal giants just continually trying (and failing) to find love.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ali-and-nino,"Westerners are all familiar with the tragic tale of Romeo and Juliet, but how about Ali and Nino, the doomed lovers that inspired the colossal automated statue named after them, which now stands by the seashore of Batumi, Georgia? The story, first told in the 1937 Austrian novel, Ali and Nino, is a familiar tale of lovers who end up in tragic circumstances that keep them apart. As opposed to warring families, in Ali and Nino’s case, it was the first World War. Ali, an Azerbaijani Muslim, falls in love with Georgian princess, Nino, but sadly, after they are finally able to get together, the war hits home and Ali is killed. The author of the novel is unknown, credited to the alias Kurban Said. But despite the unknown origins, the title has become a literary classic in the area and is considered to be the national novel of Azerbaijan. It was this famous love that inspired Georgian artist Tamara Kvesitadze to create her monumental moving sculpture in 2010. The giant metal artwork, also known as the “Statue of Love,” consists of two somewhat transparent figures made of stacked segments. Each day at 7 PM, the two figures slide towards each other, eventually merging as their segments pass between each other, never truly connecting. Sad stuff. The whole automated performance takes about ten minutes and is often lit with bright, changing colors that give the figures even more life than their stark metal bodies usually project."
69,Batumi Tower Ferris Wheel,"Batumi, Georgia",The first skyscraper to include a Ferris wheel built into the facade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/batumi-tower-ferris-wheel,"When the Technological University Tower in Batumi, Georgia was completed in 2012, it was the first building ever to include a Ferris wheel built into the facade. Hanging 330 feet (100 meters) above the ground are eight airconditioned cabins with room for a total of 40 people. It would offer a great view over Batumi, if only it was operational. The ferris wheel—as well as the 280-foot (85-meter) mast with a sail on top of the tower—proved to be a challenge for the architects and engineers designing the building, and required wind tunnel tests. Further complicating the construction, the tower was built in a moderate seismic zone. During an earthquake the soil underneath the tower liquefies, and so strategies to prevent this were also developed. What’s more, the plans to open a technological university in the city fell short, and the building stood empty for two years before it was sold in 2015. The plan was to transform the tower into a hotel since many had criticized the building for not being suitable as an education facility. Still, rebuilding it would require massive investments. Still today the tower stands empty in downtown Batumi. Whether it ends up a hotel or university or something else, it will certainly have something special to offer its visitors in the future.  The Batumi Technological University Tower is located in downtown Batumi and is clearly visible in the Batumi skyline."
70,The Cable Cars of Chiatura,"Chiatura, Georgia",These Stalin-era industrial 'death traps' hang lifeless above the city,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-cable-cars-of-chiatura-chiatura-georgia,"The city of Chiatura, Georgia was founded among otherwise uninvitingly steep valleys and deep gorges thanks to a healthy vein of manganese that was ripe for the mining. However, the treacherous terrain was too difficult and inefficient for miners to traverse on foot, so the Soviet government installed a precarious network of dangling cable cars. Amazingly, some of the original cable cars – rusted and deteriorating – were still running up until a few years ago. Now they have been retired, their stations shuttered and wagons hanging lifeless on the lines. Founded in the late 1800s as a mining colony, Chiatura quickly became a popular source for manganese and iron that was being taken from the rich mountains in the area. Unfortunately, having workers travel from their communities at the bottom of the hilly gorges and canyons up to the various mining sites each day was incredibly time consuming. So in an effort to get those bodies into those mine tunnels faster, a criss-crossing system of cable cars was installed in 1954 by the Stalinist government. The productivity and output in the mines dramatically increased with the high-flying “metal coffins,” which were also able to carry the ore itself directly to waiting factories. After the collapse of the USSR, many of the mines closed down and yet the ubiquitous cable cars remained in use. Alas, upkeep of the lines and stations wasn’t quite adequate and the old ropeways were finally retired in 2018. Some of the 17-plus old stations will now be restored as cultural heritage monuments. Meanwhile, as of September 2021, a new set of modern ropeways built by French company Poma ferries commuters and visitors around Chiatura. There are four new lines: Mukhadze, Lezhubani, Sanatorium and Naguti.  The old Chiatura cable cars are now retired and will be restored. A few of the stations are closed off with barricades, while the old wagons hang motionless on their lines. Four new cable cars are fully operational and depart from Central Cable Car Station in the centre of the city. The lines are open from 8am-8pm with a break from 2pm-3pm. Tickets cost 50 tetri one-way."

It’s a vibrant spot to hunt around for a unique souvenir from your travels. Dry Bridge gets its name from its location: it’s literally a dry bridge. Years ago, an arm of the Kura River created a small island between the east and west banks. That waterway has since dried up, but the name stuck, and the spot now holds one of the most interesting bazaars in Tbilisi. Flea markets such as this sprung up after the fall of the Soviet Union, when locals needed to find ways to make ends meet. Many of the first vendors here at Dry Bridge sold their own goods. It’s a legacy that remains today, though it has a new target audience in tourists. The Dry Bridge market has a bit of a split personality. There are the vendors selling Soviet memorabilia and household items, and then there are the vendors selling crafts, souvenirs, and artwork. Haggling is expected, but it’s unlikely tourists will get as good a deal as a local—the market is cash only and very little English is spoken, but the vendors are friendly and welcoming.  Weekends are best for visiting, but it will likely be crowded. especially in the spring and summer."
72,Abandoned Soviet Sanatoriums of Tskaltubo,"Tskaltubo, Georgia",The decaying remains of a once-luxurious Soviet spa town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tskaltubo-abandoned-soviet-sanatorium-town,"In its heyday, Tskaltubo was one of the Soviet Union’s flagship spa resorts, famous for its therapeutic mineral springs and radon water therapy. The development of the sanatorium town started in the mid-1920s and by the 1980s was flourishing under the Soviet-mandated “right to rest.” The Tskaltubo health complex consisted of 19 impressive sanatoriums and 9 bathhouses encircling and a large park. At its height, four trains from Moscow arrived in town every day carrying visitors on state-sponsored health retreats. The resort was frequented by many prominent historical figures, and there was even was a bathhouse built especially for Joseph Stalin. Then in 1990, the Soviet Union collapsed, and soon afterward the sanatorium town was abandoned. The once-grand concrete structures were left empty to crumble and decay. However they did not remain empty for long. When war broke out in the nearby Abkhazia region in 1992, an estimated 200,000 ethnic Georgians fled from the conflict, and some 8,000 refugees were given temporary shelter in Tskaltubo’s vacant sanatoriums. Twenty-five years later, hundreds of families are still living in these grand neoclassical relics of the past. Update as of November 2019: Sanatorium Iveria was recently sold. It’s currently undergoing renovations and is surrounded by fencing.  Today, Tskaltubo is still a functioning spa resort town. Several renovated hotels now offer traditional sanatorium services, but the evidence of the town's much grander past is lurking behind overgrown foliage all around."
73,Tbilisi Sulfur Baths,"Tbilisi, Georgia",A cluster of historic bathhouses built on the famed hot springs that gave the Georgian capital its name.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sulfur-baths,"Visiting Tbilisi’s mineral sulfur baths is one of the most pleasant and memorable experiences you can have in Georgia’s capital city. The name “Tbilisi” comes from the word for “warm place,” and the widely taught myth of the city’s founding involves these natural hot springs. The legend states that in medieval times, King Vakhtang went hunting with his falcon (or hawk in some versions of the story) in a heavily wooded region in central Georgia. The falcon caught a pheasant and during the struggle, both birds fell into the hot spring and died from their injuries. The king was so impressed with the hot water that he decided to clear the forest and build a city around this natural wonder. In the Abanotubani neighborhood in Old Tbilisi, a dozen different sulfur bathhouses are clustered together. They are all below ground level and some have semi-circular domed ceilings that allow natural light to stream through. The ceilings also function like little chimneys, for sulfur steam and fresh air circulation in the baths. The sulfuric water is not only gloriously warm (38-40 degrees Celsius on average), it is also supposedly therapeutic. Aside from simply being a relaxing experience, they are also thought to help with various skin ailments like acne and eczema, as well as digestion, insomnia, and arthritis. Visitors can choose between the public baths (communal sex-segregated pools where everyone bathes together) or private rooms. Both are charged by the hour. Prices range from 5 GEL for entry to the public baths right up to 200 GEL for a luxe room with a private sauna. When you check in, the front desk will ask if you want a massage or kisi (kisa) for an additional 10-20 GEL per person. If you say yes, 15 minutes after your bath starts a Mekise will enter your room with a special coarse glove for exfoliating and massaging your body. It’s not a full-on banya experience with the suffocating steam, beating branches and total nudity, but it is not exactly relaxing either. After a rather vigorous full-body scrub, the Mekise will rinse the soap off your body with hot sulfur water. The entire experience lasts about 15 minutes and returning to the sulfur bath afterward feels amazing.  The map coordinates point to Royal Bath House, one of the most popular baths in Abanotubani. Private rooms cost 140 GEL. In the room, you'll find a changing area, private sauna and plunge pool, and private sulfur bath. Bring with you: swimsuit, flip flops, towel, waterproof bag to hold your suit after use, a bottle of fresh water, shampoo/conditioner/soap, hairdryer, and any other toiletries you need to freshen up after your soak. There are plenty of restaurant options within walking distance for lunch or dinner after your trip to the baths."
74,Bank of Georgia Building,"Tbilisi, Georgia",Unusual building appears to be haphazardly built from randomly piled bricks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bank-georgia-building,"The headquarters of the Bank of Georgia is an 18-story building on the outskirts of Georgia’s capital city of Tbilisi. It was opened in 1975 as the Ministry of Highway Construction of the Georgian SSR. After the independence of Georgia, the building was temporarily unused before being acquired by the Bank of Georgia in 2007, which carried out extensive renovation work of the exterior and interior of the building. The building, by architect George Chakhava, is notable for its unusual design, which resembles piled bricks. Parts of the building are lifted off the ground, so that nature can grow beneath – an architectural concept which was known as Space City Method, centered around the idea to allow foliage to grow in all spaces around and below a building. The structure consists of a grid of interlocking parts, with three parts oriented at an east-west axis, and two on a north-south axis. The unusual design of the structure resembles architectural ideas of the Russian constructivists from the 1920s, but also incorporates elements of the Brutalism movement, most notably the use of concrete and the geometrical outline of the building. A building quite similar in appearance is the Habitat 67 housing complex in Montreal, Canada. Among all Soviet-era buildings in Georgia, the Bank of Georgia Building stands out as the most remarkable one, although today opinions are divided regarding the aesthetics of the building. Nevertheless is remains as one of the most unusual pieces of Soviet architecture ever built."
75,Prometheus Cave,"Kumistavi, Georgia",This neon lit Georgian cave claims to hold the boulder Prometheus was chained to.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prometheus-cave,"The city of Kutaisi is the second largest city in Georgia and well worth stopping through on its own, but more so for a trip to Prometheus Cave, located about 12 miles away. Prometheus the Titan, who, along with Epimetheus, was given the task of creating man, managed to annoy the god Zeus by stealing fire from the gods for man and for refusing to tell Zeus which of his children would dethrone him. As a result of this, Zeus ordered his servants to seize Prometheus, take him to the Caucasus Mountains and chain him to a rock with unbreakable bonds, where he would be subjected to a giant bird pecking at his liver. Legend has it that the rock Prometheus was chained to lies in this cave outside Kutaisi (although it is certainly not the only cave which claims the legend for its own). Discovered in 1984, the cave boasts a wonderful array of stalactites, stalagmites, petrified waterfalls, cave pearls, underground rivers, and lakes. There is also the option of a boat tour on one of the underground rivers. The cave offers a rather pleasant walk, and is spectacularly neon-lit, although the Mozart playing in certain parts might seem to be going a bit far in terms of attempting to create ambience. And if you go in winter, beware – bears and foxes have been known to hibernate in the caves during the colder months."
76,Sabir’s Chaikhana,"Tbilisi, Georgia",The last standing example of an ancient district's teatime tradition.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sabirs-chaikhana,"Tbilisi’s last chaikhana, or teahouse, is keeping tradition alive in Abanotubani, the city’s ancient bath district. Its owner, Sabir Abasov, resurrected the neighborhood hangout after the area was devastated by political unrest. In a district that once housed five teahouses and various independently-owned shops, Sabir’s Chaikhana is an example of how resisting gentrification and large-scale renovation can pay off. Today, Abanotubani is filled with souvenir stores, restaurants, and cafes, which are known for attracting the younger Georgian crowd and tourists. But this teahouse holds history and longtime local patrons close. Sabir’s Chaikhana has no sign, and as such has virtually been a “nameless” teahouse for over a decade. A stone’s throw from the much beloved Jumah Mosque, renowned for being a place of joint worship for Shia and Sunni Muslims, this tea version of a neighborhood pub is a popular hangout spot for people, men especially, who have lived in the district for years. It’s a place for those who remember when Tbilisi was filled with these types of community spaces. Historically, Tbilisi’s proximity to the Silk Road meant that teas passed through this district from both the East and the West, making for an eclectic mix of flavors. Today, the teahouse exclusively serves a loose leaf Ceylon tea, along with sugar, lemon, and nothing else.  The teahouse is open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. You can reach the neighborhood via the Abanotubani transit station, which is a two-minute walk away from the teahouse. It's a five-minute walk from other attractions like the Jumah Mosque and a one-minute walk from the sulfur baths."
