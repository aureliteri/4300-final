0,Krupaj Spring,"Milanovac, Serbia",Legends of treasure and spirits flow from this this fairy tale-like oasis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/krupaj-spring,"According to local lore, there’s much more to this dazzlingly colorful spring than meets the eye. Legend says the Homolje Mountains swallowed a large amount of gold and hid it in the Golden Cave deep under the Krupaj Spring, where the treasure is guarded by the aquatic spirit of Tartor. Each year, on the “devils day,” the spirit hits the drums and calls other spirits to a celebration. Only on that day is the entrance to the mystical cave open. Vlach women who want great power enter the river at night to meet the spirit. In return, the spirit demands a prize, usually a beautiful young woman. The spring is not only a source of Vlach myths and legends. It’s also an ecological oasis. The hypnotizing turquoise water is surrounded by plants, their branches descending into the cold water like the arms of great forest guardians. Above the lake rises a picturesque cave, fulfilling the fairy tale-like backdrop. Underneath the lake is a maze of underground canals, which are challenging even for the most experienced divers. The stream of the spring, 1,427 feet (435 meters) long, confluences with the Krupaj River. A dam built near the spring creates an attractive waterfall as well."
1,The Skull Tower of Nis,"Niš, Serbia",Structure built from the skulls of vanquished foes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skull-tower-nis,"Piling up heaps of skulls of your vanquished foes represented the apogee of barbaric warlord behavior. This ancient practice survived in some cultures well into the historic times. Ćele Kula, (lit. Skull Tower) in Niš Serbia, built in 1809 by Turkish general Hurshi Pasha out of skulls of defeated Serb rebels represents one of the most recent and best preserved examples of this tradition. The year 1809 marked the turning point in the course of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire (1804-1813). The outnumbered rebel army faced a 36,000 strong force of Turkish imperial guards near the strategically important southern city of Niš. Rather then surrender or flee they decided to put up a desperate last stand at Čegar Hill. Faced with imminent annihilation, the rebel commander Stevan Sinđelić in an act of desperation fired a shot into a gunpowder keg at the fully stocked gun powder room, blowing up his entire army as well as wiping out enemy soldiers who were already flooding the rebel trenches. Deeply angered by the rebel force’s actions, the Turkish commander Hurshid Pasha decided to teach a grim lesson to the Serbian nation. The bodies of the dead rebels were mutilated. Their skins were pealed off their decapitated heads, stuffed up with straw, and sent to the Imperial court in Istanbul as proof of Turkish victory. The skulls were used as building blocks for a tower built by the main road at the entrance of the city. A warning to the local populace of an impending fate to any potential future rebels. In total, 952 skulls were used. In its original form, the tower stood 15 feet high and 13 feet wide. Skulls were arranged in 56 rows, with 17 skulls in each row, at each side of the tower. The skull of rebel commander Stevan Sinđelić was placed at the top. This gruesome edifice, left a deep scar in the Serbian national psyche. However, it failed at its purpose. The Serbs rebelled again in 1815, this time successfully, driving off the Turks and winning independence in 1830. In the years immediately following the building of the tower, the families of deceased rebels chiseled away some of the skulls in order to give them proper funerals. Today 58 skulls in total remain in the tower. The authorities of Serbia in 1892 built a chapel around the tower to preserve this unique monument representing the nations bravery and sufferings. The skull of Stevan Sinđelić is also on display at the chapel. As an added curiosity, a nearby brick factory bears the name of ?ele Kula."
2,Golubac Fortress,"Golubac, Serbia",This 14th century castle withstood years of battle but is now sliding off the hills into the Danube.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golubac-castle,"Golubac Fortress is one of the best preserved medieval fortresses in Europe. Yet the advent of modern technology has submerged some of the outer walls of this storied Serbian fortification, finally causing the decay of a powerful compound that survived years of war and battle. Comprised of 10 different towers protecting three internal compounds, Golubac Fortress was a powerhouse guarding the Danube. Despite its formidable structure, it changed hands many times throughout its existence, but even war and constant attack could not destroy the thick stone walls. Unfortunately, the only thing strong enough to begin the death of Golubac was modern technology. In 1964, a hydroelectric dam on the Danube caused flooding along its shores. The rising water levels eventually submerged Golubac’s outer walls along the lower bank. Along with the Danube’s invasion of the fortress, a road was created that passed through the walls, once again proving that the only way to breach Golubac was with the technology of modern progress and infrastructure. In 2005, a campaign to restore the overgrown fortress was undertaken and Golubac is now a popular tourist site in Serbia, especially during boat tours of the Danube."
3,Belgrade Tesla Museum,"Belgrade, Serbia","Nikola Tesla's ashes are held in a golden sphere, surrounded by his works.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/belgrade-tesla-museum,"In the center of Belgrade, a villa holds the world’s largest collection dedicated to the life and work of scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla. Famous for his rivalry with Thomas Edison — and for his invention of the alternating current (AC) current electrical system, the induction motor, most likely radio transmission, and, of course, the Tesla coil — Tesla’s heritage is complicated. He was an ethnic Serbian, but an Austrian citizen, born in what was at the time the Austrian Empire, now Croatia. He lived his professional life in Budapest and Paris, then moved to America. He later became an American citizen, and he died in New York City in 1943. Ten years after his death, his records were transferred by his nephew to the new museum in Belgrade. The museum consists of seven display rooms holding thousands of documents, books, photographs, and equipment belonging to Tesla. Several models are on display, including one of the famous Wardenclyffe laboratory in New York. The collection was named part of the UNESCO Memory of the World program, dedicated to the preservation of documents and materials related to world knowledge, in 2003. The museum is currently engaged in a program of digitizing the documents in their collection. Tesla’s ashes are held in a golden sphere in the third room, and his death mask is in the last. There are several other, smaller tributes to Tesla around the world, including a small museum and statue dedicated in 2006 in his hometown of Smiljan, Croatia."
4,Uvac River Meanders,"Družiniće, Serbia",A sinuous path among steep cliffs creates a stunning sight in southwestern Serbia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/uvac-river-meanders,"Over its course of 119 km (74 miles), the Uvac River carves a deep and winding valley through a dramatic karst landscape of mountain peaks, towering escarpments, and expansive caves. Among such engaging terrain, the Meanders stand out as a particularly striking portion of the Uvac River’s ruggedly picturesque channel. The Meanders are formed by a series of tightly packed, looping arches that the river has sculpted out of its limestone bed over the millennia. In this stretch, the canyon walls can soar up to 100 meters (328 feet) above the twisting and turning waters below. The result is a natural setting that is as impressive from any elevation. The Uvac River Meanders are part of the Uvac Special Nature Reserve, a protected area first created in 1971 that now encompasses a total of 7543 ha (29 square miles). The reserve is home to several notable species of birds and fish, including the osprey, eagle owl, goosander, chub, barbel, huchen, and sneep. The area is particularly popular among vulture lovers, as it serves as a sanctuary for the griffon vulture, a bird featured on many Serbian coats of arms whose wingspan can reach 3 meters (10 feet). The griffon vulture faced extinction as recently as 20 years ago, but is now thriving in the Uvac River Valley, thanks in large part to conservation groups that have set up large “outdoor restaurants” for the scavengers, stocked with carrion and slaughterhouse waste. The majestic birds can often be seen perched on the cliffs overlooking the Meanders.  Boat tours are available, but only via authorized guides, as restrictions are in place to limit numbers of visitors. Contact the local tourist bureau for information on booking a tour."
5,Bubanj Memorial Park,"Niš, Serbia",This memorial park stands on the site of one of the largest mass executions of the Second World War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/memorial-park-bubanj,"World War II isn’t known for those who survived it. Holocaust memorials solemnly honor the dead from Berlin to New York. Russia is speckled with hallowed battlegrounds where the bodies claimed by the winter war fell two-deep. The Normandy American Cemetery is the most vast and haunting American service cemetery outside of Arlington National Cemetery. In Serbia, things were just as bad. Bubanj Memorial Park marks and honors the location of one of the most horrific mass executions of the entire war, where more thаn 10,000 Serbs were taken prisoner, gathered and unceremoniously shot by invading German forces. Estimates of the brutal event’s toll range between ten and twelve thousand lives lost to the execution. The majority of the victims were citizens оf the Serbian city of Niš, which is where the memorial park іs located. Bubanj Memorial Park is at once a stark and empty locale meant to inspire reflection and honor, but also a functioning public park, complete with memorial trails and monuments. At the park’s center, a 23 x 2.5 meter marble monument consisting of five separate monoliths abstractly symbolizing the progression of the war and its effect on the local populace, moving from German invasion and execution squads to Serbian resistance and eventual victory. The monuments themselves only compliment the larger memorial, which is the park itself, build on hallowed ground once the site of a human atrocity that should never be forgotten. Situated оn the hill southwest оf the Bubanj оf Niš, whіch cut the main road Niš - Skopje, іs situated 2 km frоm the оther Serbian Cultural Property оf Great Importance, Crveni Krst concentration camp."
6,Ružica Church,"Belgrade, Serbia",A Serbian church lit by chandeliers made of weapons.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruzica-church,"Lighting the frescoed walls of Ružica Church, a small chapel tucked into the side of the Serbian Kalemegdan fortress, are two chandeliers made entirely of spent bullet casing, swords, and cannon parts. It is a more fitting decoration than one might realize. Controlled at various times by the Serbs, Turks, Hungarians, and Austrians, the small dark Ružica church has seen a lot of action. The space the church now occupies was, for over 100 years, used by the Turks as a gunpowder magazine. The church had to be largely rebuilt after World War I. Though damaged by bombings, there was an upshot to the devastation. While fighting alongside England and the US, Serbian soldiers on the front line used their downtime to craft the incredible chandeliers from the materials available to them: the spent shells and weaponry that lay strewn around the battlefield. The soldiers managed to carry their light giving creations to the church, where they still light the room to this day."
7,Kosmaj Monument,"Koracica, Serbia",This spaceship-like Serbian monument reaches for the stars in celebration of the fallen fighters of fascism.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kosmaj-monument,"The Kosmaj Monument (Kosmaj Spomenik in Serbian), is made of several freestanding concrete structures, each roughly 40 meters high, that taken together look a bit like a spaceship sent through time from a future envisioned in the 1970s. Built in 1970 by sculptor Vojin Stojic and architect Gradimir Medakovic, the brutalist monument celebrates a group of partisan fighters in World War II who battled against the German occupation in the south of Belgrade. During the fighting, the battalions lost over 5,000 soldiers but their “guns of freedom kept shooting.” The monument itself sits atop the highest peak in the region like some sort of Christmas star crowning a mountain-sized tree. According to modern visitors, the monument is in some disrepair and unfortunately, the locals do not seem to have any interest in restoring it."
8,Western City Gate of Belgrade,"Belgrade, Serbia",A pair of connected skyscrapers form this symbolic gateway.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/western-city-gate-of-belgrade,"The Western City Gate in Belgrade is not so much an actual throughway into the city as it is a massive portal that has been created by a couple of linked towers, capped with a restaurant as a crown. Alternately known as the Genex Tower, the Western City Gate was built in 1977 as both a commercial and residential space, divided between the two skyscrapers. The towers are exemplars of the angular brutalist style and look not unlike something plucked from a sci-fi dystopia. The shorter of the two towers (at 26 stories tall) is actually home to the Genex company offices among other office space, while just across the gap is a taller tower (standing 30 stories tall) that is reserved for residential space. All said and done, the skyscraper(s) rank as Serbia’s second tallest buildings. The pair of towers are connected at top by a two story foot bridge that not only allows people to travel between the structures, but also provides for some amazing views of Belgrade. On top of one end of the bridge is circular revolving restaurant reminiscent of the pinnacle of the Space Needle in Seattle if that were perched atop a grim spire. Anymore, the sides of the well-known building are plastered with advertisements that often hang down the length of the structure. Even with these bright ads giving some color to the structure, its brutalist look manages to shine through, and this symbolic city gate remains a rather dour introduction (or final image) for the city."
9,Drina River House,"Bajina Bašta, Serbia","For over 40 years, this quaint little house has teetered on a rock in the middle of a river.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/drina-river-house,"Outside the town of Bajina Bašta, at the narrows of the Drina River, a curious little house has rested on its rocky perch since 1969. For more than 40 years, this increasingly famous, nameless cabin has balanced atop a rock in the middle of the river. It has been miraculously spared by the annual rising and falling of waters. According to the story of its construction, a group of youth became enamored with the spot after noting the outcropping in the middle of the Drina River was an ideal place to tan and swim. In the following year, the owner undertook the laborious task of building the house on the rock by hand, which he acknowledges could not have happened without the help of his friends. Since that time, the one-room cabin has served as a holiday respite for its creator. At the time of its construction, all the house’s building materials were rowed out by the boatload. Little has changed today, as a watery traverse through the swiftly flowing currents of the Drina remains the only way of reaching the rock on which the house sits. After National Geographic published an image of the unnamed little house as its “Photo of the Day,” outsiders began making pilgrimages to the banks of the Drina in order to verify its existence with their own eyes. In the process, they’ve been given a glimpse into the greater beauty of the surrounding Tara National Park, which has been shortlisted by UNESCO to receive coveted protection status since 2002. The park is a mountain refuge known for its dense forests, steep limestone cliffs, and deep canyons formed by the Drina’s upper reaches. Sometimes referred to as the “River of Life,” the Drina itself first gained pre-Internet fame more than half a century ago thanks to Nobel Prize-winning author Ivo Andrić, who introduced the world to its waters as an immortal bearer of life’s greatest struggles, through works such as 1945’s The Bridge on the Drina. Though not exactly off-limits to outsiders, the budding landmark is a piece of private property and should be respected as such."
10,Ruins of Yugoslav Army Headquarters,"Belgrade, Serbia",Destroyed Serbian army headquarters sits half crumbled in a largely revitalized Belgrade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruins-yugoslav-army-hq,"The 1990s were a turbulent, war-ravaged decade on the Balkan peninsula. But in last 10 years a lot has changed and Serbia has once again largely re-integrated into European society. Traces of the wars of the 1990s are hard to find in Belgrade, except of course for the gaping ruin of the ex-Yugoslav/Serbian Army headquarters. The building was hit several times during the NATO campaign. The bombing of the building was primarily of symbolic importance, as all essential command functions had already been evacuated to a secure location in the days prior to the outbreak of the war. After the end of hostilities the building was deemed too damaged for immediate repair and it remains in the same bombed-out condition to this day. If its destruction was largely symbolic, so too is its continued state of disrepair. For many Serbs, the destroyed army headquarters has become a monument to the lost war, and a morbid tourist attraction for foreign visitors. It is within walking distance of the main railway station and international bus terminal. Building is situated on the corner of Nemanjina and Knjaza Miloa streets. Nemanjina street starts from the front of the main railway station. Start climbing uphill towards Slavia Square. Building is within 10 minutes walking distance."
11,Tito's Blue Train,"Belgrade, Serbia",Ride in 1960s style on the private luxury train Marshal Josip Tito used to travel around Yugoslavia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/titos-blue-train,"In an unassuming railway depot south of Belgrade lies a relic of a forgotten era. Built in a time when Yugoslavia was recovering from the Second World War, this iconic blue train served to transport the country’s leaders around the different republics of Yugoslavia, and entertain foreign dignitaries so critical to the diplomatic success of the socialist nation. The Blue Train, Marshal Josip Tito’s private train, was built with luxury in mind. Tito preferred to travel by rail, and as Yugoslavia became more prosperous in the years after the war, the train reflected the optimism and wealth of its primary user, if not that of the average citizen. Custom-built coaches were decorated in a simple yet modern socialist realist style, with certain classical holdovers such as intricate mosaics and dark hardwood lining. The overall effect is one of understated power, which comes as no surprise considering some of the train’s clientele. Used often by Tito for domestic purposes, the Blue Train also served an important diplomatic role. Its guest list is a veritable who’s-who of 1960s power players, from Queen Elizabeth to Charles de Gaulle to Yasser Arafat. It’s easy to imagine diplomats and party officials seated around the massive main dining table or crammed into the modernist, Zodiac-themed bar, as Tito sought to provide the world a path between the American-led West and the Soviet sphere of influence. It’s still possible to enjoy the splendor of the Blue Train, which has been remarkably preserved in its original state.  If your pocketbook is big enough, you can do so as Tito did: for a hefty fee, the Serbian Railways will hook up the train for a trip on the spectacular Belgrade-Bar railway. The line is one of Tito’s biggest public works projects and one of the most scenic rail journeys in Europe; the 296-mile route between the Serbian capital and the Montenegro  coast passes over 435 bridges and through 54 tunnels. For those whose wallets aren’t quite as fat, it’s still possible to enjoy the Blue Train, and walk through the very same cars where Haile Selassie sat, Queen Elizabeth dined, and Josip Broz Tito slept.  To visit the train, you'll need to purchase a ticket, which can be a small adventure in itself. The historical railway station where they were once sold has now been closed, but try the Beograd Centar station VIP or Information desks. Try to find a clerk that speaks English, and explain you want to see the ""Blue Train."" Failing this, the words in Serbian are ""Plavi Voz."" It helps to email ahead using the address on the Serbian Railways' website under ""Special Services."" And, if all else fails, the folks at the Serbian Railway Museum in downtown Belgrade, some of whom speak excellent English, are very helpful in arranging a visit. Once you have a ticket, just hop on the #3 tram and ride all the way to the Rasadnik stop—the depot is just across the railway tracks. Be cautious when crossing these and entering the depot--in addition to frequent train traffic the depot is actively used as a railway maintenance facility and there is frequent movement of heavy equipment. Show your ticket to the guard just past the main depot doors, and if they are open and there are some available workers, they'll open the train."
12,St. George's Church,"Topola, Serbia",The interior of this Serbian royal family's mausoleum is covered with exquisite mosaics.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-georges-church-oplenac-mausoleum,"St. George’s Church, also known as the Oplenac Mausoleum, is both a church and mausoleum for members of the Karađorđević dynasty. It was built by King Peter I of Serbia. The temple is a monumental building. Its interior is covered with more than 40 million pieces of colorful glass, creating a dazzling array of more than 15,000 shades of color. The mosaics, which pay tribute to the most prominent Serbian medieval frescoes and monasteries, surround the marble floor and iconostasis. The church wasn’t always meant to have such wonderful mosaics. Originally, King Peter intended to have the names of all the soldiers who died in the Balkan Wars carved into the wall. But the king perished before the church was complete, and the start of World War I meant a new conflict was soon to claim more soldiers’ lives. The upper part of the church contains the tombs of the founders of the Karađorđević dynasty. Six generations of the family, including Prince Alexander and King Alexander I, were buried in the church. Down in the crypt, you’ll find 39 additional tombs.  The church is located on the Oplenac Hill, near the town of Topola.  In addition to the church, the complex includes the royal vineyards and winery, the house of King Peter and the Vineyard Keeper's House."

A local legend holds that the strangely shaped rocks are the remains of a wedding party that was instantaneously petrified by the devil, as punishment. In total there are 202 stone formations in Đavolja Varoš, between two and 15 meters in height, with a mean diameter of about 1 meter. The stone pillars are topped by stone blocks weighing as much as 100 kg. Two extremely acidic (pH 1.5)and mineral-rich (15 g/l) springs are situated nearby."
14,Maglič,"Maglič, Serbia",The ruins of this medieval castle on a foggy hill tell the story of a once-mighty empire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maglic,"Maglič is a 13th century medieval castle near Kraljevo, Serbia. It’s located on a hilltop surrounded by the curvy Ibar river. The name Maglič is said to come from the Serbian word magla meaning fog, as the hill underneath often disappears in the mist. It’s unknown when the castle was constructed, but it’s believed to have been done so on the orders of either Stefan the First-Crowned or his son Uroš the Great. The castle was designed to safeguard the monasteries of Sopoćani and Studenica, and also to prevent further Mongolian raids into Serbian lands. However, a local legend tells a different story of the castle’s history. It’s said that Serbian despotess Jerina, also known as “The Damned Jerina,” founder of many medieval fortresses, constructed the castle and threw many of her lovers into the deep well inside the walls. Among the locals, the castle is still known as Jerina’s Town. Another legend claims that Uroš the Great planted a valley of lilac flowers along the Ibar river gorge below the castle, to make his French wife, Helen of Anjou, feel more at home. The castle consists of seven towers and one dungeon tower connected with ramparts and stone walls. The interior can be accessed through two gates. Inside the fortress are the remains of a palace, barracks, water reservoir, a well, and the Church of Saint George. After World War I, the castle was partly restored. The main restoration took place during the 1980s, and then again in 2010. The castle is recognized as a Cultural Monument of Exceptional Importance by the Republic of Serbia.  The castle offers amazing views and is a short walk up a hill."
15,Gavez Klub,"Belgrade, Serbia","Tucked in an urban forest, this restaurant specializes in homemade, healing rakijas.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gavez-klub,"Named after a local plant, Gavez Klub is a family-operated restaurant secluded in the urban woods along the Sava River in Belgrade, Serbia. According to the manager, Djenka Mihajlovic, the gavez herb is used in folk medicine to “fix bones” and local folklore describes its use for magic by witches. Opening with a series of rock concerts in the summer of 1999, Gavez Klub was an ambassador of the hope that came across the people of Belgrade just three months after the NATO-inflicted bombings of the city. At that time, the venue was just a big yard with a small house and a few benches and tables made from fallen trees. Over the years, Gavez has grown and become a beloved gathering spot for Belgrade locals and a favorite place to take friends visiting from abroad due to its off-the-beaten path location and rich, homestyle cuisine. The limited menu changes daily and consists of just one set of courses to choose from as well as an array of house-made rakijas, a regional spirit infused with various fruits and herbs. In addition to rakijas made with grapes, plums, and pear, Gavez Klub’s herb-infused rakijas have purported healing benefits, including fighting off colds. Each menu item is prepared using ingredients from local markets and, while it may resemble a pre fixe menu with one option for each course, guests are welcome to order just one or two items instead of having the full array of offerings. Not only a restaurant, Gavez Klub also operates as a venue for concerts, art festivals, weddings, theater productions, yoga classes, and support groups. Regarding their clientele, Mihajlovic says, “We could never choose our guests; we did try, but it never worked out. All layers of society, all people of different ages, families, couples, single or lovers they all found Gavez and in some point of their lives made it their own.”  Check their Facebook page before going, as they're sometimes closed for private events."

It is one of the most beautiful and well-preserved medieval castles in Slovakia, dating back to the 13th century. Its long history starts as a military barracks built after a Mongol invasion to defend what was then the Kingdom of Hungary. Seven centuries later it still stands, now an elaborate neo-Gothic castle that holds many unique myths and legends. Notably, the striking exterior was used as the filming location for Count Orlok’s Transylvanian castle in the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, a claim to fame that adds to its haunting appeal.

18,Ruins of Cachtice Castle,"Čachtice, Slovakia",The blood-soaked ruins of the castle where the murderous Blood Countess was walled in alive.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruins-cachtice-castle,"The site of one of the most sensational - and sensationalized - serial murders in history, Hrad Cachtice stands now empty and mostly ruined. In 1611 the household of the Hungarian countess Elizabeth Bathory was accused of torturing and killing as many as 600 young women within the walls of this castle. Over time, the story began to include accusations of sexual attacks and turned Elizabeth into a aging beauty obsessed by the idea of eternal youth found in the blood of virgins. Now perhaps irretrievably mired in myth and speculation, it may be impossible to completely separate fact from fiction. This much we know: Elizabeth was real, and died here. She was part of the powerful Hungarian Bathory family, and something went very wrong here in the early 1600s. She was married in 1575, as part of an arranged marriage at the age of 14 and received the Cachtice castle property, along with the surrounding feifdom of 17 villages as a wedding gift from her husband. The castle itself dates to at least 1276, when it was mentioned as a border protection fortress. In the early years, they seemed to be more or less a normal aristocratic family - he fought in battles far from home, she hung around the various family properties and eventually bore three children. Although there were a few strange accusations in the early 1600s, things did not get really weird until after her husband’s death in 1604, when she permanently moved to the castle property. Allegedly the routine (yet brutal) punishments of servants escalated into torture and death for minor infractions. A taste for violence led Elizabeth to send her loyal staff into the surrounding villages and countryside to lure young women to the castle, where they often met with grisly ends. When the locals started to wise up and refuse to let their daughters and sisters go to work at the castle, Elizabeth hit on a genius idea: in 1609 she opened a school for lady’s etiquette, then known as a Gynaecaeum. Young women from far-flung noble families began to arrive to receive instruction in the womanly arts from the aging widow. But it was this decision to become involved with noble families that was her downfall, as young ladies went missing, their angry fathers and brothers began to notice strange goings-on at the Castle Cachtice. In 1610, her castle was visited by local authorities, who reportedly discovered injured and dead young women on the property. Her three loyal collaborators were immediately seized and imprisoned. After what has been described as a show trial, the two female collaborators were executed in 1611, their fingertips pulled off with pincers before they were thrown alive into a fiery pit, which shows that the standards of the times were not so far off from Elizabeth’s own predilections. The male servant was beheaded and then thrown into a pit. There is speculation that the force of the trial may have been amplified for political reasons, with opportunists taking advantage of the opening to seize property and wealth from the Bathory clan, particularly since Elizabeth stood alone as a widow. The records also seem to indicate that Elizabeth was not specifically named herself as the perpetrator of the crimes, instead her household was implicated, perhaps out of deference to her status, and the possible embarrassment it would cause to other members of the nobility who had consorted with her. Elizabeth was placed under house arrest, walled in a tower of the castle, while the trial of her servants commenced. She remained there in isolation for four years, fed through a slot in the wall, until she was found dead in 1614. She was originally buried in the local cemetery, but due to local distaste, she was moved to her family home in Ecsed, Hungary. In the following centuries her story was alternately forgotten, and then sensationalized. Speculation has turned her into a lesbian vampire tyrant who sought eternal youth through the blood of virgins, but the truth seems to be gory enough without the supernatural trappings. The castle was abandoned in 1708, and is now in ruins. Visitors can hike up to the ruins from the town of Cachtice, where there is also a small museum in the main square, and the church where her body was originally interred.  There is a motorised bus-train that runs a limited round-trip service from the parking lot up the hill to the castle. A small fee is charged. The walk up is a steady climb of about 15-20 minutes. The grade is is on loose gravel and uneven surfaces, as is the grounds of the castle. Those with mobility issues may want to be advised to use caution and care."
19,Painted Village of Čičmany,"Čičmany, Slovakia",A perfectly preserved hill village where the buildings are painted like white lace.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/painted-village-of-cicmany,"The tiny village of Čičmany (population 204) looks just like it did hundreds of years ago, untouched by time. But this is no ordinary preservation area. The village is full of black timber houses, each one decorated with intricate traditional patterns in white lime paint. Literally street after street is lined with folk art. Although the records of the village at Čičmany date back to the 13th century, covering the houses in lacy, geometric and stylized patterns is a much later tradition. It began around 200 years ago, when white lime would be used to help preserve damaged wood. The image of the bright lime pigment on the dark wood was striking, and people began elaborating on themes, eventually covering most of the timber-frame structures with remarkably uniform designs. The buildings that line the little streets today are actually even more modern, although in the traditional folk architecture. In 1921 a fire raced through the village, and many structures had to be restored. With the help of the Slovakian government, funds were made available to keep Čičmany as it had been for centuries. It was established in 1977 as the world’s first folk architecture reserve, ensuring the protection of its buildings, and unique cultural heritage. Čičmany is in northwestern Slovakia, about a two-hour drive from Bratislava. It is possible to reach Čičmany by public transport. The easiest way is to take a bus from Žilina to Rajec, and from there, another bus to Čičmany. However, there are very few buses passing through Čičmany. Visitors stranded in Čičmany can take advantage of the traditional houses turned into penzions (B&B). In addition to the preservation of the structures, the village Považie Museum works to also keep up traditions of festivals, local folk music and art, costume and folk dances. The village is also popular ski destination (Ski center Javorinka). Čičmany is within easy reach by car from Prievidza/Bojnice (known for its spa and picturesque medieval castle) and makes a nice day trip combined with visit of beautifully carved wooden Slovak Betlehem in Rajecká Lesná."
20,UFO of Bratislava,"Bratislava, Slovakia",This spaceship sculpture in the middle of the Slovakian capital looks like it just crash-landed.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ufo-of-bratislava,"There is a large housing settlement on the east side of Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. It’s comprised of three tight circles of low-rise towers from the Soviet era, both in their vintage and their design. In the middle of the center circle is a park—harboring a UFO. The area is called Medzijarky, and was built in the mid-1970s when Slovakia was still half of Czechoslovakia, and all of Czechoslovakia was part of the Soviet bloc. The UFO sculpture at its center was erected at the time of construction, created by local artist Juraj Hovorka. It’s big—15 feet tall and 26 feet across—so big that kids originally were able to crawl inside and play Star Trek (if only Czechoslovakian TV had Star Trek). A well-known and well-schooled sculptor, Hovorka actually lived in one of the Medzijarky towers. His work tended towards what might be called “monumental realism,” which could also describe his UFO—“realism” for an alien spacecraft that is. The name Medzijarky translates roughly as “between the ditches” in Slovakian, and the neighborhood was built during the period of communist rule over the joint state. The years following the country’s split saw the project fall into disrepair and neglect, and that included the quirky UFO. Eventually plans were made to revitalize and update the housing, and the city wanted to take the sculpture down. But the neighbors stood in defense of their spaceship, and lobbied successfully to keep it. The Medzijarky UFO is actually the second most famous UFO in Bratislava. There is one that tops the downtown bridge over the Danube, and it’s become a kind of symbol of for the city. It rises 27 stories over the water, and hosts a sky-scraping destination restaurant. The bridge UFO may be better known, but this one, although it no longer allows the human children inside, looks more like the real thing. Bratislava is the capital of Slovakia and is in the far west along the Danube River, near the borders of both Austria and Hungary. The UFO is in Medzijarky Park, which is encircled by low-rise housing towers and shops. It's about 6km (4 miles) east from from the center of the city."
21,Stone Waterfall,"Salgótarján, Slovakia",Inside the Šomoška National Nature Reserve exists a unique rock formation rarely seen in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stone-waterfall,"Not far from Šomoška Castle, resides a 30 foot (9 meters) high stone “waterfall” composed of hexagonal basalt pillars. This unique rock formation formed around four million years ago when basalt lava hardened into these unique columns. It’s the only example of this beauty in the region, and is only one of seven found in the world. Not far from this geological wonder is the stone “sea,” an area filled with shards that have cascaded from the formation. Similar stones were also used to build the nearby castle.  All of these treasures can be seen in approximately 30 minutes while walking through the reserve."
22,Sokolia Dolina Gorge,"Hrabušice, Slovakia",Climb around the high waterfalls on series of iron ladders and bridges within the wildest gorge in the Slovak Paradise.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sokolia-dolina-gorge,"The Sokolia dolina gorge is the hidden gem of the Slovak Paradise National Park, a beautiful wilderness dotted with wonderful waterfalls, the tallest of which reaches nearly 250 feet (75 meters) high. There are several other trails in the aptly named Slovak Paradise that are considered highlights of the park— such as Suchá Belá, via ferrata Kyse, or Prielom Hornádu—but on this maybe even more beautiful hike you will meet only a few tourists, even in the high summer season. The trail leads through a spectacular, almost untouched forest environment. If you’re lucky you might encounter some wild animals such as deer, chamois, or even lynx. But the top attraction of the trail are surely the waterfalls. There are several, equipped with wooden and iron ladders and bridges you can use to climb around the falls. The highest of them, Závojový waterfall, is a real test of your courage, which is rewarded with a beautiful view from the top. The best time to visit the gorge is in spring and autumn, after rainy days, when the waterfalls have a really large flow. If you need any other information before you start the hike, visit the tourist information centre in Čingov or write an e-mail on info@raj-spis.sk. The easiest access to the trail is from tourist centre Čingov, near the town of Spišská Nová Ves. The whole round hike with start and finish in Čingov may take you about 6 hours, so it is good to start in the morning. The trail through the gorge is passable just one way (from the bottom to the top), so you have to return by another trail. But don't worry, all the trails are well marked so that you will hardly get lost there. You don't need to take any special equipment with yourself, just your hiking boots and a waterproof jacket."
23,Stará Bystrica Astronomical Clock,"Stará Bystrica, Slovakia",The world's newest astronomical clock is also its most accurate.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stara-bystrica-astronomical-clock,"The world’s youngest astronomical clock towers above the central square in a small Slovakian village. Its colorful astrolabe is the star feature of a building that seems to flow as fluidly as time itself. The clock was built in 2009 during renovations on the town square. It’s the only horologe of its kind in Slovakia. Because its satellite-controlled software allows it to display true solar time, it’s also said to be the most accurate astronomical clock in the world. The timepiece is aesthetically astounding. Its face shows the movements of the celestial world. On its astrolabe, the moon chases the sun on an endless journey through the zodiacs. The clock also translates the way humans interpret these constant astronomical shifts, labeling not only the minutes and hours but also the days and months. A golden arrow strikes each day’s date. Its building, too, is also a sight to behold. The structure ripples and folds around the clock tower, forming the shape of a seated woman in billowing clothes that’s meant to resemble the Virgin Mary. Bronze busts of historic Slovakian figures are perched within nearby niches. An hourly parade of small statues representing Slovakian saints occurs during the day, set to a soundtrack of the tower’s tolling bells."
24,Cumil the Sewer Worker,"Bratislava, Slovakia",This Slovakian statue of an emerging sewer worker might just be a bronze peeping tom.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cumil-the-sewer-worker,"Meet Cumil, Bratislava’s somewhat notorious sewer worker statue. Is he resting? Is he heading down to clean up your mess? Is he just lurking? Debate rages on as to what this cheeky chap is actually doing as he pokes out of a sculptural manhole in Bratislava’s old town district. The odd statue was installed in 1997 as part of an effort to spice up the look and feel of the area, which was traditionally marked with drab, Communist-era architecture and decoration. As Cumil is leaning out over a curb it comes as no surprise that his head has been clipped off more than once by careless motorists. The statue isn’t just a danger to drivers, but to pedestrians, too. Woe betide the drunkard stumbling their way home in the dark; he’ll have you on the ground if you’re not paying attention. In order to protect drivers, amblers, and— most importantly—Cumil himself, the city installed a warning sign just above his head. Physical dangers aside, Cumil has come to be a beloved institution in the city, and visitors come from all over to lay in the street and look him in the eyes, or just sit on his head.  Centrally located in Bratislava's old town."

After years of weather, the images were destroyed, but the group replaced the images with new ones in 2015, which you can still see today. In the right square of the church you can find a glass floor that gives a look underneath the church, where some people where placed after they died."
26,Bratislava’s Hidden Bunkers,"Bratislava, Slovakia",A line of disused military bunkers built to defend against Nazi invasion lies hidden on the outskirts of the city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bratislava-s-hidden-bunkers,"In Petržalka, the very edge of the city of Bratislava on the western bank of the Danube, sits a string of concrete bunkers scattered across a variety of fields and woods. These are the best-preserved remnants of an expensive border defense system that was constructed throughout the country over 80 years ago. In the 1930s, what was then Czechoslovakia invested in a line of military fortifications to defend against invasion by Nazi Germany, which by 1938 following the annexation of Austria (Anschluss), also threatened Bratislava, which sits on the Danube mere miles from the Austrian border. At the time of building the bunkers were state of the art, but ultimately proved of little use. Under the Munich Agreement brokered between Britain, France, and Germany, Czechoslovakia was forced to give up most of its borderlands, including the bunkers. This left the country with a new, poorly defended border and soon afterward the entirety of what was Czechoslovakia fell under Nazi control. There are 14 surviving bunkers along the stretch of border. The largest and best preserved is BS-8, which is maintained as a museum by a team of dedicated volunteers. If you are lucky or make advance contact, they will give tours allowing you access inside the restored bunker. BS-8 is located next to a small World War I cemetery and a slightly incongruous picnic area and playground. Other smaller bunkers, BS-9, and BS-7 can also be found nearby. Standing at BS-8 you can see a nearby road across a field; this road is where the border with Austria lies. Standing at the bunker looking across the perfectly flat fields, you get a sense of the vulnerability the young nation that created these bunkers must have felt.  There are tours to the bunkers but they are also accessible by public transport or walking. Finding the bunkers is not always straightforward though, and it helps to have access to a phone or other device with GPS-enabled maps. Most of the bunkers are marked on Google Maps or the map on the Bunker BS-8 website. BS-8 (and nearby BS-9 and BS-7) are probably the easiest to get to and, for energetic visitors are a good starting point to work your way back to the city along the string of fortifications. To get to BS-8 take the number 80 bus from Zochova stop near the old town and travel for 7 stops to Kopčianska street. Once you get off, walk further down Kopčianska street until you see the signs on the right that say ""bunker."" Do not take the advice of Google Maps in taking other buses such as the 91 or 191 and following alternative walking paths routes. They may not look it, but they are significantly more convoluted once you get off the bus. BS-8 can also be accessed by car directly from the Austrian side of the border."
27,Most SNP,"Bratislava, Slovakia",This Slovak bridge is known both for its connection to a national uprising and its UFO-shaped eatery.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/most-snp,"Straddling the Danube in the city of Bratislava, Most SNP (short for Most Slovenského národného povstania, which is in turn translated to “Bridge of the Slovak National Uprising”) is meant to honor a tumultuous time in Slovakian history, but is better known for the saucer-shaped restaurant atop its single, asymmetrical pylon. Completed in 1972, this cable-supported bridge is the longest single-pylon suspension bridge in the world, and has likely undergone more name changes than any other bridge as well. Originally christened, the “Most SNP” in honor of a 1944 resistance movement against Nazi forces, the bridge was soon known almost universally as the “UFO bridge” due to the circular restaurant, which was originally destined to be an observation platform, that was built atop its single set of pylons. Recognizing the overall dismissal of the bridge’s original name, the city changed the name to “Novy Most,” or “New Bridge” in order to incorporate popular sentiment. Unsurprisingly, many citizens were not pleased with this change and voted to change the name of the bridge back to, “Most SNP” in 2012. Despite the near constant name-changing, the Most SNP and its UFO Restaurant (the eatery’s official name now) still draw visitors from all over the world interested in the unique engineering as much as the scenic view."
28,Rusovce Mansion,"Bratislava, Slovakia",A once-fairy tale mansion now stands in a state of disrepair.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rusovce-mansion,"Surrounded by crumbling walls and a sprawling English park, the Rusovce Mansion is a decaying example of neoclassical architecture. There are records of a castle at this location dating back to 1266, but today visitors to the area will only see this once-glorious white mansion constructed between 1840 and 1906. Part of the foundation of the building dates back to the 16th-century. Several royal families once called the mansion home prior to World War II. During the conflict, the mansion was used by Nazi SS officers. The park around the mansion contains meandering paths dotted with sculptures and monuments, with at least one from the communist era. A decaying wall with entry gates borders the property. There is also a courtyard that has became a local haunt for graffiti artists.  The mansion is on the edge of Rusovsky Park (which is the closest address recognized by Google Maps). There is a sign on the gate to enter the park that says “Enter at Your Own Risk.” However, many people enter every day and the park is a popular spot for joggers, walkers, and families. Park across the street or visit the coffee shop located in a former church next to the walls. There is also a restaurant and ice cream shop accessible from inside the outer wall."
29,Church of St. Elizabeth,"Bratislava, Slovakia","Also known as the Blue Church, the building was consecrated to the daughter of Andrew II.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-of-st-elizabeth,"This beautiful, vibrant church is tucked away from the big crowds, it truly resembles a building plucked from the pages of a fairytale. The church doesn’t resemble many of the buildings you will find across Bratislava. It was built during the early 2oth century and crafted in Hungarian jugendstil by famed architect, Ödön Lechner.  Opening hours are really short. You can only visit the inside from 07:00 a.m. till 07:30 a.m. Then again between 5:30 p.m. and 7:00 p.m."
30,Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art,"Medzilaborce, Slovakia",An extraordinary museum devoted to the pop art legend created by Slovak artists.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/andy-warhol-museum-of-modern-art,"Located in the town of Mezilaborce near the border with Ukraine, the Andy Warhol Museum of art was founded in 1991. Inside of the communist-style concrete structure is a sizable collection of Warhol works of art and memorabilia.  While Warhol never set foot in the small town of 6,000 people, the absurdity of a museum dedicated to him in a no-name town might have amused him. The museum dedicated to his works was created by a wave of petitions made by Slovak artists and other public figures after Warhol’s death. In a time where the “Velvet Revolution” was crushing the Communist Revolution, it seemed like a logical choice for Ladislav Snopko, the minister of culture at the time, to support the museum."
31,Kláštorisko,"Letanovce, Slovakia",The ruins of a 13th-century monastery that long served as a place of refuge from wars and raids.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/klastorisko,"For centuries, the ruins of a medieval Carthusian monastery were hidden under the grass and trees at what is now Kláštorisko, an archeological park within the Slovak Paradise mountains. The remaining stone structures and walls were once part of a sanctuary perfectly defined by its Latin name, “Lapis Refugii,” or “Rock of Refuge.” Located on a rocky plateau surrounded by deep gorges and canyons, the site was used as a shelter for local people in many dangerous situations over the centuries, such as wars, raids or epidemics. It lent the national park its name, “raj,” meaning “paradise.” In the 13th century, the sanctuary protected the inhabitants of Spiša during the devastating raids by the Tatars. Hundreds of locals managed to survive by escaping to Kláštorisko. Following this event, Carthusian monks built a monastery there, founded in 1299. But the plateau was likely used as a safe haven long before that. Archeologists found that the site was already settled and fortified in the pre-Christian era, and believe it may have served as a refuge from the very beginning. The remains of the monastery have been renovated in recent years by groups of volunteers. It is now the site of one of the main tourist centers of the national park. Near the ruins, you can also visit a newly built symbolic cemetery dedicated to those who tragically died in the Slovak Paradise, and also to those who contributed to the development of the park. It is decorated with several interesting wooden statues carved by local artists. Kláštorisko is at the crossroads of several tourist trails within the park. You can get there from tourist centers Čingov, Podlesok or either Letanovský mlyn. It is not a very difficult nor long hike from any of them, but be prepared for a rather steep ascent and descent. For more information visit the center at Čingov or Podlesok, or contact info@raj-spis.sk."
32,Predjama Castle,"Predjama, Slovenia","Castle and secret tunnel withstood a siege until its owner was killed by the Holy Roman Empire, while sitting on the toilet.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/predjama-castle,"Built directly into a rocky cliff face, Predjama Castle, or Predjamski grad in Slovenian, was considered virtually impenetrable when it was constructed in the 13th century. However, a few centuries later the structure’s fortifications were put to the test when a robber baron started a war with the Habsburgs and was forced to hole up in the castle for over a year. According to legend, Erazem Lueger and his family had taken over the Gothic Predjama castle in the late 15th century. Acquiring land and power, Erazem had become a well-known robber baron in the region. However, he quickly grew too big for his britches, murdering the kinsman of Frederick III, the Holy Roman Emperor. With the strength of all of his forces, Frederick came after Lueger, and forced him into hiding in his castle. Despite the Emperor’s superior forces, the rebellious Lueger had both brains and a secret tunnel between the castle and the nearby Postojna Cave. For an entire year and one day, Lueger snuck out of the castle and replenished food and drink through the tunnel from a nearby town. Finally, after surviving for so many days, one of his servants sold him out. Waiting for Lueger to use the outhouse on a high floor of the outside face of the castle, the servant raised a flag and one single shot from a cannon blasted the baron off the toilet. The castle has been completely reconstructed many times over the years. With a Renaissance-style remaining, the Gothic facade and the legend of Erazem Lueger are often forgotten. However, the Postojna Cave is still in use, allowing visitors to relive the siege and covert activities of a knight who crossed the wrong royal family of Europe. Another peculiar fact is that the cave under the Castle is the home to a colony of bats.  Approximately 10 km from Postojna Cave. The best option pricewise is to purchase a combo ticket with entry to the cave and the castle."
33,Skocjan Caves,"Matavun, Slovenia","This massive subterranean fissure is known as the ""underground Grand Canyon.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skocjan-caves,"One of the most monumental underground features in the world, Slovenia’s Skocjan Caves seem to have sprung directly from the mind of a fantasy author. Often referred to as the “Underground Grand Canyon,” the Eastern European cave system features one of the largest subterranean chambers in the world. The biggest room in the limestone cave network, known as “Martel’s Chamber,” is a gaping canyon which was formed by the underground flow of the Reka river, which still rushes along the bottom of the chasm. Thanks to the amount of water that flows through the canyon, the caves also hold a number of eye-catching geological features such as limestone pools, travertine terraces, and giant stalagmite formations. The cave’s unique spaciousness also hosts a number of species of bat, countless unique bio-organisms, and even a variety of fish that have never seen the light of day. A bridge has been built spanning the chasm so visitors can experience the colossal geologic divide. Archeological research in the area found that the caves were home to humans as far back as 10,000 years in the past. It’s likely that the caves were used by ancient people for shelter, and, although there is absolutely no science to support it, the Skocjan Caves also seem like they may have been the perfect lair for a dragon. No photos are allowed inside the cave, even without flash or with smart phones."
34,Bled Island and Castle,"Bled, Slovenia",This one-time health resort was used by aristocrats around the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bled-island-and-castle,"Bled is a small municipality in northwestern Slovenia that was once part of Yugoslavia and became independent in 1991. In the late 1800s Bled Island and village, located in the middle of glacial Lake Bled, were seen as a health resort by aristocrats from around the world. Today the island and the Assumption of Mary Pilgrimage Church are known to be major tourist attractions. Bled Castle is an iconic landmark because of its location teetering on a cliff overlooking the lake. The Assumption of Mary Pilgrimage Church was built in the 15th century and is known by visitors because of the 99 steps that lead up to the church. Traditionally, local grooms carry their brides up these steps while the bride remains perfectly silent, in order to bring them happiness in the future. The church also has bells that visitors ring for good luck. Tourists can hire boats to get to the church. Bled is famous for a dessert called the Bled Cream Cake which can be purchased at many of the cafes and restaurants in Bled.  Following the signs for Trail 6, the inclined trek begins. You will pass a small farm and then are quickly enveloped in the forest. After about 10 minutes, the trail splits to the right for the first lookout point, Ojstrica, which makes the initial steep climb pale in comparison. After a set of steep switchbacks, in the last five steps to the top, the view begins to emerge. The lookout point features zero barriers. There are no fences, no railings — just you and the wind and the rocks and the magnificent scene. To reach Bled Island, you will need to take a boat.  You can take a traditional pletna row boat for about 15 euro per adult as of June 2021."
35,Metelkova,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",This abandoned Slovenian military barracks has become a punky-political art squat.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/metelkova,"The Slovenian art commune now known as Metelkova was once a military barracks, but you would never know it by its state today, covered in a psychedelic cacophony of naive art, graffiti, and punk rock visuals. Originally built in 1911 by the Austro-Hungarian Army, the site consists of seven barracks buildings sitting on a little over three acres of land. The military used the little walled neighborhood until 1991 when the army abandoned the site as Slovenia attained independence from Yugoslavia. Once the site was vacated, it wasn’t long before groups of squatters began moving in, and making the old buildings their own. In 1993, the Slovenian government tried to demolish the old barracks, but nearly 200 activists, artists, and protesters took over the site and saved it from destruction, for a time. The government never gave up trying to tear down the site, but the squatters and protesters that continued to hold the never gave up their fight. One of the buildings, known as the “Old School” was successfully taken down in 1997, and another building, known as the “Small School” was also demolished in 2006. However the remainder of the space remains as a rebellious artistic community space that is still in some amount of contention with the government. These days most of the buildings have been covered in graffiti, folk art, found tile mosaics, weird sculptures, and punk rock statements of purpose. It now also houses a bar, a nightclub and a hostel, as well as the free-living squatter population. A museum called Galerija Alkatraz is now located in Metelkova.  Ask any local in Ljubljana and they will point you in the right direction, 5 minutes from the city centre, on Metelkova Ulica."

Formed millions of years ago by the Pivka River, the caves span 20km, a quarter of which is open to public tours on foot and by miniature train. Visitors are offered green felt cloaks to shield them from humidity before the train chugs past underground lakes and enormous caves, including the massive Concert Hall. Many of the stalagmites have assumed strange, humanoid shapes over time, giving the cave network the appearance of a goblin kingdom. A trip to the caves sometimes allows a peek at the olm, or “human fish”. These blind amphibians take their nickname from their human coloring and can grow up to 16 inches long. If you are allowed access to the tanks, be kind and spare these sensitive beasts any flash photography.  In the south of the country, bordering with Croatia there is a glampsite called Big Berry. This all-inclusive glamping experience, depending on the time of year and availability, offers shuttles and tours to Postojnska Caves."
37,Dragon Bridge,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",A whimsical bridge adorned with decorative dragons.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dragon-bridge,"Dragon Bridge is the most fairytale of fairytale bridges in the delightfully fairytale city of Ljubljana, Slovenia. Combining old-world charm with medieval mystique, this bridge isn’t afraid to celebrate its Gothic construction nor the mythical side of the area’s history. Festooned with ornamental dragon statues among the already ornate embellishments, this delightful monument is a favorite with visitors who love to see through it the playful (or frightening?) side of the city. While medieval in style, this attraction came into being in the early 20th century as part of urban renovation. An 1895 earthquake had damaged the previous boring old wooden bridge, and the powers that be decided to try out a new, innovative technology called reinforced concrete, and throw some cool dragons in there for good measure. The bridge stands as a technical monument to the new static calculations of the time, and to the reinforced concrete that forever changed urban expansion. In the early 1980s, the bridge was renovated with a lightweight concrete. The beautiful fantasy-themed bridge holds the titles to a couple of firsts: first Slovenian bridge paved, first reinforced concrete bridge in Ljubljana, and it came in a strong third for largest arch in Europe at the time of its construction. All technical marvels aside, obviously the main attraction is the fine example of Vienna Succession style and the four dragons guarding the bridge, two at each end, with sixteen smaller ones decorating its span."
38,Cyanometer,"Ljubljana, Slovenia","Martin Bricelj Baraga's monolithic sculpture measures the blueness of the sky, and changes color to match it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/martin-bricelj-baraga-cyanometer,"Cyanometers have been color-coding the sky since the late 18th century, but Martin Bricelj Baraga’s Cyanometer sculpture adds a modern twist. Located in the center of Ljubljana, Slovenia, the monolithic structure blends art and science, measuring the blueness of the sky and looking stunning doing so. Not only does Baraga’s cyanometer periodically capture images of the sky and measure them against the 53-shade color wheel toward the top of the structure, it uses the data to imitate it, changing color to blend in with the sky. Day and night, cloudy or bright, its reflective surface shines for passersby in the various shades it adopts. Like a traditional cyanometer, the sculpture, which is more than 10 feet tall, is also a scientific instrument. From the blueness of the sky it determines the air quality in the area, which is affected by the presence of moisture and particles in the atmosphere. A nearby Environmental Agency of Slovenia measuring station assists the sculpture in collecting this data and determining its exact nature. The cyanometer then sends the information to a website and displays it, along with the temperature, on its own surface, with air quality measured on a color scale that goes from red to green. Invented by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure in 1789, the original cyanometer was made with 53 squares of dyed paper, arranged in a circle from white to black by way of shades of blue. By holding the device up to the sky and studying the blueness under different circumstances, de Saussure established the criteria that Baraga’s cyanometer uses to measure the quality of the air today. The cyanometer in Ljubljana was installed in the town’s pedestrian zone in 2016, and Baraga, an intermedia artist, plans to install similar devices in York, England, and Wroclaw, Poland, in 2017. It is part of Baraga’s “Nonuments” series, installations in public places based on futuristic and utopian ideas. The sculpture is made of glass and stainless steel and powered by solar panels, which means not only does it power itself in the center of Ljubljana, but it could do the same anywhere in the world. Slovenia’s capital city has been working toward becoming as green as possible for the past 10 years, and the installation of the cyanometer corresponded to Ljubljana being named the European Green Capital of 2016. This makes it perhaps the best place for such an installation, one that both judges how clean a city’s air is and literally reflects that cleanliness back at it."
39,Velika Planina,"Stahovica, Slovenia",An otherworldly alpine pasture with its own unique microculture that recalls Middle Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/velika-planina,"On May 29, 1944, an American B17 Flying Fortress bomber plane called Liberty Bell crashed atop an otherworldly mountain in Slovenia. The World War II bomber went down on Velika Planina, an idyllic alpine plateau where centuries of herders have grazed their sheep and cattle. Located high in the Kamnik-Savinja Alps, Velika Planina (which means “Big Pasture Plateau”) is no ordinary mountaintop. Tourists compare it to the mythical Narnia (indeed, parts of the Narnia films were made in Slovenia) or J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth, and it truly is a fantasy land—a flat, rolling meadow dotted with low-slung wooden houses and backdropped by the snowcapped Alps. This high mountain landscape also has its own unique microculture, with a traditional costume (wooden shoes and a raincoat made of pine shavings), food (Trnic, a hard, parmesan-like cheese that is intentionally made in the shape of breasts—and made in pairs, naturally), houses (low-slung against the wind, looking like Hobbit holes), and folk traditions (a local ethnographic museum has a knife carved with enchanted runes, to work against curses). And in 1944, this enchanting landscape was the site of an extraordinary event. Ten Allied soldiers were on the plane went it crashed on Velika Planina, two of whom were killed on impact. Nazi soldiers were occupying Slovenia at the time, and the hunt was on for the remaining crew members. Two were eventually captured by the Nazis, but six others were first found by the local Slovene Partisans (an anti-Nazi resistance group). Three of these airmen were well enough to make their own way down the mountain, but three were badly hurt, including the pilot, and were taken to a secret Partisan hospital that was hidden in the thick forests below the mountain. The American soldiers needed an IV drip, so supplies were precariously smuggled from the nearest town, Kamnik, by Partisans. Two of the Allies successfully recovered from their injuries over the course of a 10-day stay in hiding at the foot of Velika Planina. In the end, the captain, Oto H. Hinds of Boulder, Colorado, could not be saved. He was buried near the secret Partisan hospital. The gravesite that can be visited today, along with the ruins of the hospital, along a beautiful walk from Kamniška Bistrica up towards Velika Planina. Scrap metal from the crashed Flying Fortress was gathered by locals and used to construct buildings. Look closely and you’ll notice that one of the cowherd huts on Velika Planina is fitted with a very special door, which was once the hatch to the bomber.  Velika Planina can be accessed by car (a long circuitous drive to the top), or by a 10-minute gondola ride from Kamniska Bistrica, near the town of Kamnik. It is open for skiing in the winter, and you can rent cottages there (most without electricity or running water). There are numerous good mountain huts that serve food and drink, and it is great for hiking. Once you're at the top, Velika Planina is almost completely flat, making it good for walking, even with children. Visitors should be informed, that even if arriving by car, they cannot drive the last leg of the trip. Be prepared for an uphill walk to this magnificent site. Locals can drive there, and hitchiking can be successful!"
40,'Faces' of Locksmith Street,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",A trough of 700 strange bronze faces runs through a narrow alley in Ljubljana's old town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bronze-faces-locksmith-street-kljucavnicarska,"Ključavničarska ulica, or “Locksmith Street,” is a narrow alley in the medieval old town in the Slovenian capital city. The start of the lane is marked with an image of a key, historically used to note the street name for those that couldn’t read. As you continue down the path, a mysterious sight unfolds. Cutting through the middle of the cobblestoned street is a gully that appears to be flowing with hundreds of strange little faces. The limbless bronze casts are highly expressive, almost theatrical. Some are happy, some crying, some almost grotesquely distorted. There are 700 of these bronze faces running through the center of the alley, culminating in a drinking fountain and a couple other odd sculptures, namely a bronze hand and a skeleton trapped in a cage. This surreal scene is the work of the renowned Slovenian sculptor Jakov Brdar, whose bizarre bronze figures can be found throughout Ljubljana. Often, his work is inspired by Greek mythology, as is the case with the sculptures on the Butchers’ Bridge in the center of the city. The faces of Locksmith Street were inspired, however, by a piece of writing by the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. It begins, “To think, for instance, that I have never been aware before how many faces there are. There are quantities of human beings, but there are many more faces, for each person has several.”  The ""Faces"" installation can be seen on the ground of Ključavničarska ulica in Ljubljana's medieval old town. Other bronze pieces sculpted by Jakov Brdar can be spotted throughout the city."
41,Danse Macabre of Hrastovlje,"Hrastovlje, Slovenia","The walls of this medieval church are covered with perfectly preserved frescos, including a pristine example of the Dance of Death.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/danse-macabre-of-hrastovlje,"The 12th-century Holy Trinity Church in Hrastovlje was fortified in the 1500s to defend it against Turkish attacks. The high defensive wall which surrounds the church means that from a distance only the top of the tower can be seen peeking out above the walls. Inside, the church hides a beautiful secret. Hidden beneath thick layers of plaster, nearly perfectly preserved medieval frescoes were discovered in 1949, covering almost every inch of the walls and ceiling of the church. The artworks were completed in 1490 and have remained unchanged ever since. Among the paintings is a rare and pristine example of the Danse Macabre, or Dance of Death, which depicts characters from all walks of medieval life being led by skeletons to the grave. This painting served to remind the people of Hrastovlje of the fragility of life and universality of death. Among the paintings on the church walls you can also see markings in the now-extinct Glagolitic script, a very early Slavic writing system. Entry to the church costs €3. To gain access visitors should call the number written on the church door and a guide will come and let you in. Guidebooks are available in many languages including English. It is possible to buy locally produced wine and olive oil from the church for very reasonable prices."
42,Olm,"Postojna, Slovenia","The ""dragon babies"" of southeastern Europe.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/olm,"The olm (Proteus anguinus) is a species of blind amphibians endemic to the deep underground caves of the Dinaric karst of southeastern Europe. The unusual appearance of the olm is the result of extensive adaptations to its habitat. Olms inhabit deep underground lakes and pools, where they spend their entire lives in almost complete darkness. As a result, the skin of these animals is devoid of pigment, making it resemble white human flesh. The local name of the creature is “oveja ribica,” which means “human fish.” The snake-like olm was mentioned by Charles Darwin in his seminal work On the Origin of Species as an example of the reduction of structure through disuse. The eyes of the olm are severely underdeveloped, an adaptation to its dark surrounding. Larval olms retain normal eyes for the first four months of life before the organs start to regress. By the time the species reaches its adult stage, the visual system has almost completely atrophied. Olms retain many other neotic (juvenile) traits, common in other amphibian species—most notably a pair of well-developed gills—into adulthood. The strange appearance of these creatures has made them an object of human fascination for centuries. Although their deep-water habitat is generally inaccessible, flood waters occasionally carry olms to the surface. Medieval legend considered them baby dragons, as their serpentine bodies and gills corresponded well to the descriptions of these mythological reptiles, and their soft pale purple skin resembled that of a human newborn.  These creatures could be best observed in Postojnska Jama cave complex in Slovenia, a well developed tourist spot with a museum which displays a captive colony of olm (The only place in the world other than the inaccessible underwater caves where visitors may view live olms)."
43,The Old Vine,"Maribor, Slovenia",The world's oldest grape-producing vine has survived four centuries of turmoil and even has its own anthem.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-old-vine-maribor-slovenia,"A grape vine in Maribor, Slovenia, clings to the outside of a building in the city center. Its lush leaves form a verdant stipe along the wall, creeping outward from the gnarled cordons. When in season, Žametovka grapes dangle from the plant like sweet, sugary ornaments. The Old Vine is, according to Guinness World Records, the oldest grape-producing vine in the world. It was planted more than 400 years ago to make wine when the Turks invaded the city. Centuries later, it’s a beloved resident of Maribor and even has its own anthem, which many locals will proudly sing, glass of vino in hand. The plant is a stalwart specimen, a resilient survivor of centuries of turmoil. Though the building it stretches across was once a wall that shielded the city from invaders, the vine escaped from many siege attempts intact. It somehow managed to thrive despite the fires that blazed within the wooden structures that once surrounded the space, then later endured a parasite that plagued nearby vines in the 19th century and outlasted the Allied bombing that destroyed nearby buildings during World War II. Now, the vine wraps around the outside of its very own museum. After admiring the old plant from the outside, you can enter its resident building to learn about the city’s wine heritage and sample some drinks in the wine tasting room. There’s also an annual festival to celebrate the vine’s ceremonial grape harvest, which yields upwards of 120 pounds of fruit. Only 100 bottles of wine are produced from its grapes each year."
44,Fort Hermann,"Bovec, Slovenia",A crumbling World War I fort that is reached through a series of concrete tunnels.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fort-hermann,"By the end of the 19th century, Fort Kluže, a now touristic fort right off the motorway, had fallen into disuse because of the rapid development of artillery. In order to have sufficient fortifications in the area the construction of, the upper fort, Fort Hermann, began in 1897.   Best access is to park your vehicle at Fort Kluže then hike up. Don't forget a headlamp! To reach this fort you will find yourself hiking 30-40 minutes up a 1,300 meter access road and a 114 meter long tunnel. Between the two wars, the Italians added fortifications to the tunnel including concrete entrances and side corridors for heavy machine guns to form part of the defense system called, ""Vallo Alpino"" (The Alpine Entrenchment). Once you reach the top you can explore the ruins of this 1800s fort as well as climb into caverns in the side of the mountain overlooking Bovec."
45,Tuhinj Valley,"Laze v Tuhinju, Slovenia",A beautiful drive through the foot of the Alps traces the path of 15th-century Turkish raids.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tuhinj-valley,"For many centuries, cities and town have lit huge bonfires atop mountains or other high points to warn against impending danger. The first fire lit would alert the next beacon, creating a chain reaction at the first sign of trouble. This ancient relay system was at play in 1471 when a raiding party of the Ottoman Turkish army made a foray into the Tuhinj Valley in what was then part of the Habsburg Empire, and is now in northern Slovenia. As the invaders approached the town of Kamnik from the south, the first beacon would have been ignited at Stari Grad, the castle on a high cliff above the town. Further bonfires would have ricocheted along the Tuhinj Valley, running eastward, flames coursing into the sky from hilltop to hilltop. Bonfire watchtowers were set up at Posavje, Sveta Gora, Limbarska Gora, Sveti Miklavž, and Menina Planina, warning the settlements several miles further on of the coming danger. There was little the locals could do. There were castles but no standing army, and the Turkish raiders moved swiftly. Thankfully for Slovenia, the territory was deemed too poor, too far from Istanbul, and too close to the strongholds of Venice and Vienna for the Turks to focus their attention there for long. So Slovenia avoided the might of the army proper, evading the fate of Serbia and Bosnia, and instead had to deal with periodic, smaller-scale incursions that were, nonetheless, terrifying. When the bonfires were spotted, the locals would rush to their churches, many of which were built with fortifications designed to withstand such raids. The citizens would bundle into the church, lock the gates, defend the walls, and pray fiercely. Sometimes this worked, other times not, but all in all, Slovenia got off lightly in terms of enemy armies over the past thousand or so years. A beautiful short drive now follows the exact path of those marauding Turks back in 1471, as it carves through the lovely Tuhinj Valley (pronounced “too-heen”). The valley, called “Tuhinjska Dolina” in Slovenian, is cut through with a road linking Kamnik and Vransko. Taking a half-hour to drive without stops, the route passes an endless array of heavenly vistas, swaths of farmland, “kozolci” (a unique Slovenian hay rack), fortified churches, clustered villages, some good home-cooking country inns, and even a thermal spa. While the Turks made their way from wealthy Kamnik on east through the valley towards Vransko, and you could certainly drive that direction, many suggest the ideal path is the other way, especially if you’re a motorbike enthusiast. The reason is that the town of Vransko has—wait for it—the Slovenian Motorcycle Museum, home to a large and impressive private collection. As you head on into the valley, you can wind your way to Motnik, a village crowned with an enormous church and ringed with fields of grazing cows. In Laze v Tuhinju you can stop at the Meninc Farm, where farmer Frenk brews his own beer (as microbrew as it can get) using his own hops (he grows the “styriaca” variety, indigenous to Slovenia). In the village of Šmartno, which is actually a conglomeration of 13 different villages, the church of Saint Martin stands as the first church in Slovenia consecrated after the Second World War. In the village of Gora, you can visit one of the fortified anti-Turkish churches, Sveti Miklavž. It includes a pair of defensive towers and a “black kitchen,” a medieval kitchen still in use and blackened with smoke over the centuries (you leave smelling like bacon, in a good way). The main attraction in the valley is the thermal spa, Snovik. The highest-altitude spa in the country, it hosts tens of thousands of guests a year, who come from around the world to relax and bathe in the natural waters that emerge from an aquifer 120 meters beneath the earth and stay a delightful 30 degrees Celsius. There are good eats along the way, too. The down-home Pri Čibru serves enormous portions of cutlets, roasts, schnitzel, potatoes and more. For more refined fare, try Repnik, near Kamnik. There you can sample some of the hyper-local dishes specific to the Tuhinj Valley, especially Tuhinjska fila (Tuhinj Stuffing), which consists of bread, whipped egg whites, egg yolks, and either sweetmeats (if you’re going traditional) or smoked pork neck. It’s like the best stuffing you’ve ever had crossed with an omelet. You want to try this. On your arrival in Kamnik, you can enjoy the liveliness of a larger town, visit its three castles (including Stari Grad, where the beacon bonfire was first lit), sample its many microbrews (it is a candidate for microbrew capital of the world, for the most microbrew beers per capita), and spend the night. For home cooking, there is the Yugoslav retro Gostilna Murka, which is conveniently located a few hundred feet from Samostan Mekinje Monastery, where those pesky Turks, back in 1471, pillaged and ran off with the nuns in residence.  If you want to spend the night in this area, you can sleep at Snovik, a significant thermal spa resort, where the above address and map coordinates point to. You could also enjoy a night in the medieval monastery in Kamnik, at Samostan Mekinje Monastery, where former monastic cells have been spruced up into hostel-style rooms at very cheap rates. To visit any of the beautiful churches along the Tuhinj Valley, you normally need to call ahead, or stop at the Tourist Information Center in Kamnik, or at the front desk at Snovik, and ask them to call for you. There are special tours available, often for free, and various local events and experiences can be arranged--from wine and beer tastings to massages to hikes--with a bit of advanced notice."
46,Lečtarski Museum,"Radovljica, Slovenia",Nibble as you learn about Slovenia's longstanding tradition of making beautiful honey cookies.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lectarski-gingerbread-museum-radovljica,"Slovenian bakers have been transforming honey-infused dough into beautiful cookies known as lect for centuries. Those who descend the steps to a basement bakery in the town of Radovljica can learn all about this tradition⁠—and sample more than a few treats⁠—at the Lečtarski Museum and Workshop. Located in a building that’s been selling lect since 1766, the bakery operates as a living museum where visitors can witness the traditional craft of lectarstvo, or lect-making, up close. Bakers, often clad in folk costumes, use tin and wooden molds to shape the dough into everything from animals and houses to people and bells. The cookies’ most common and beloved form, however, is a heart that’s dyed red and decorated with frosting flowers and a white trim. Though the cookies are most often compared to gingerbread, their primary flavor is local honey. In addition to baking lect, the region also has a long history of beekeeping. Those who want to learn more about this other local craft can take their cookies to-go as they walk a few doors down to the town’s Museum of Apiculture.  The owner of the bakery also runs an adjacent restaurant with regional food and an inn."
47,Kamnik,Slovenia,This small Slovenian town has become a magnet for microbreweries.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kamnik,"In previous decades, Slovenia was full of microbreweries with around 200 in operation. The microbreweries were gradually bought up and closed down by the two national beer giants, Union and Lasko, in an effort to eliminate the competition. Today, the town of Kamnik is a haven for microbreweries. For decades, entering a bar in Slovenia and ordering a beer was only a question of choosing red (the color of the Union can) or green (the Lasko). Then starting in the late 90s, a few pizza pubs started making beer alongside local independent microbrewers. Today, there are between 60 and 80 microbreweries in Slovenia, many of which can be found in the city of Kamnik. The reason there are so many microbreweries concentrated in Kamnik comes down to one thing: its water. Kamnik is celebrated for having pure, good quality water. Water is crucial in beer-making because of its calcium. Calcium determines the “hardness” of water and helps to define the flavor and clarity in a finished beer. In Kamnik—where oddly enough the water quality changes just a short drive out of town—water quality plays a big role in the number of microbreweries popping up.  You can taste the local beers at Gostilna Korobac or Pub Pub Skalo, both in Kamnik. For more information or for beer-related tours, you can contact Tourism Kamnik."
48,Casa Batlló,"Barcelona, Spain","One of Antoni Gaudí's most classic buildings is well-known for its ""dragon-back"" design.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casa-batllo,"One of Gaudí’s most iconic works, Casa Batlló was built to look more like the physical layers of an animal than a private residence. Also known among locals as the “House of Bones,” Casa Batlló seems to have been designed with the shapes of organic viscera in mind. The house was built in 1877 and purchased by the middle-class Batlló family in 1900 due to its central location and (originally) undesirable appearance. In 1904, Gaudí was commissioned to redesign the facade and interior of the structure, making it priceless. The facade is divided into three distinct sections, each reflecting a level of anatomy. The base level looks as though it is gridded by huge abstract bones, while above that the front takes on a more chaotic, abstract pattern echoing blood vessels and muscle, and then the entire structure is capped with a scaly roof section that looks like nothing so much as the back of a giant dragon. The interior of the building is no less organic. While Gaudí only remodeled an existing building, it would be hard to tell from the smooth, undulating insides of the large noble hall. Walking the halls is like strolling through the soft organs of some immense creature. The Batllós have long since vacated the building, but it is still open as a museum dedicated to the architect and visitors can experience the unique building for themselves."
49,Sagrada Família,"Barcelona, Spain",Construction of Barcelona's iconic (but controversial) church is expected to be completed in 2026—a century after the death of its architect.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sagrada-familia,"When the foundation stone of the Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família was laid in 1882, it’s unlikely that anyone involved anticipated that the construction of this church would take well over a century to complete. But when Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, now famous for his unique take on the Modernista movement, took charge of the project a year later, he scrapped the original neo-Gothic design plans and exchanged them for a grander vision, unlike any the world had ever seen. Gaudí worked steadily on his masterpiece until he died after being hit by a tram in 1926, at which point an estimated 15 to 25 percent of the total design, including the crypt, the apse walls, a portal, and a tower, was complete. Since then a series of architects have attempted to continue his legacy. Not surprisingly, progress on Sagrada Família’s construction has faced a few setbacks over the past 130+ years. Vandalism in 1936 following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War resulted in the destruction of many of Gaudí’s models. The sacristy was destroyed in a fire in 2011. When complete, the church will be composed of three major facades, two of which — the Passion facade and the Nativity façade — have already been completed, while construction of the Glory facade remains ongoing. Much of the ornate Nativity facade was completed by Gaudí himself, who feared that beginning with the austere Passion facade would temper the public’s enthusiasm. The Passion facade’s gaunt, tortured figures, sculpted by Josep Maria Subirachs, have met with probably some of the harshest complaints from critics, though the church’s website defends the design, saying its graphic nature remains true to Gaudí’s original vision of a facade meant to inspire fear. The Glory facade, expected to be the largest and most impressive of the three, began construction in 2002. The church’s interior is defined by columns that stretch like tree branches toward the ceiling. Gaudí’s love of nature and its link to religion can be seen throughout with numerous carvings of animals and other wildlife. Gaudí’s plans also called for 18 spires, eight of which are complete, as well as numerous towers, chapels, portals, and other interior features. When built, the tallest spire, which symbolizes Jesus Christ, will secure Sagrada Família’s place as the world’s largest church building. Though Sagrada Família is said to be Gaudí’s magnum opus, the architect appeared unfazed by its glacial progress,  remarking, “There is no reason to regret that I cannot finish the church. I will grow old but others will come after me. What must always be conserved is the spirit of the work, but its life has to depend on the generations it is handed down to and with whom it lives and is incarnated.” Despite this statement’s apparent acceptance of the inevitable variations on his design at the hands of the architects who followed him, some have advocated for leaving the church unfinished out of respect for the original designer. Some projections have Sagrada Família’s completion date as 2026, the centennial anniversary of Gaudí’s death, while others estimate construction could continue into the 2040s. Though still incomplete, the church sees an estimated 2.8 million visitors every year.  It's best to visit in the early morning or late evening as the sun shines through the stained glass windows on the walls filling the church with an abundance of color. You're also likely to have less of a wait and crowd to navigate through around these times. Timed tickets are available in advance and the lines can be long so take advantage of this service."
50,Labyrinth Park of Horta,"Barcelona, Spain",This semi-secret storybook hedge maze is also the oldest garden in the city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/labyrinth-park-of-horta,"The archetypical hedge maze sitting in the center of Barcelona’s Parc del Laberint d’Horta (Labyrinth Park of Horta) is one of the city’s hidden gems, having delighted visitors for centuries making it the oldest garden in the city. Work on the labyrinth and the surrounding gardens began in 1791 as part of a wealthy estate owned by the Desvalls family. The maze and its attendant Italian-inspired terraces were part of the original construction that is today known as the Neoclassical section of the park. The majority of the rest of the park was created in the mid-1800s, and is now known as the Romantic portion, however as the name implies, it is the central labyrinth that really steals the show. The tall manicured hedge walls of the maze create over 2,000 feet of twists and turns for visitors to get lost in. Anyone who makes it to the center will find a statue of Eros, Greek God of Love, implying that the romantic part of the garden existed even before any expansion. There are also pavilions that overlook the maze and feature their own statues of Greek gods, and a picturesque pond at one end. The gardens were given over to the city of Barcelona in the 1960s and are now a public park. Since it is set off from the regular tourist strips, the Horta labyrinth remains a magical little secret for those willing to get a little lost.  The powers that be charge a modest entrance fee – €2.23, or free on Wednesday and Sundays – and only let in 750 visi­tors a day."
51,Park Güell,"Barcelona, Spain",Gaudí's famously flamboyant architectural style is on full display in this sprawling park and garden.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/park-guell,"At Park Güell, stone, tile, plants, and Mediterranean skies magically come to life on a mountainside perch designed by Barcelona’s resident architectural genius, continuing to delight adults and children alike. Built between 1900 and 1914 as part of Gaudí’s naturalist phase, the project was initially designed as part of Count Eusebi Güell’s private city, who envisioned the plot as a self-contained residence with private homes for 60 families. Only later was the failed housing development reimagined as a municipal park, which opened to the public in 1924. Nestled among Carmel Hill’s north face, the main terrace of the park offers sweeping panoramic vistas of the city below – including many of Gaudí’s other famous creations peppering the landscape – featuring a scalloped perimeter and a giant bench built to resemble a sea serpent. At the main gate, a giant salamander known as “el drac” or “the dragon” greets visitors upon their approach to the terrace, as they wend their way through a network of Doric columns, some palm-like, that support a pillowy roof inlaid with mosaics. Colonnaded footpaths lead to manicured gardens and trick arboretums, as gracefully curving viaducts and roadways soar overhead. Gaudí’s former home, too, now converted into a museum, is easily distinguished by its Pepto-Bismol pink exterior rising four stories tall from the garden grounds. Despite embodying a purpose entirely separate from its initial conceptualization, Park Güell remains so transcendent in its current form that it was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984, ensuring that the public will continue to find respite in this fantasy world for centuries to come. Access to the Monumental Zone of Park Güell is limited to 400 tickets every half hour. Most of the park is free to get into, but for the Monumental Zone including Plaça de la Natura and Gaudi's famous Salamander, you need to have a timed ticket."
52,Calder Mercury Fountain,"Barcelona, Spain",A beautiful but toxic fountain of mercury.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/calder-mercury-fountain,"Mercury, also known as quicksilver, is a beautiful, mirror-skinned metal that is liquid at room temperature. It is also extremely toxic. For many years, the world’s greatest source of mercury were the mines at Almadén, Spain, which produced some 250,000 metric tons of mercury over nearly two millennia of operation. So when Spain decided to build a monument to the mine (which was long worked by criminals and slave laborers, most of whom died of mercury poisoning), they commissioned American sculptor Alexander Calder to build a graceful fountain which, instead of water, would pump pure mercury. Calder’s Mercury Fountain was displayed at the Spanish Republican Pavilion for the 1937 World’s Fair in Paris, and was situated in front of Pablo Picasso’s famous painting Guernica. Like Guernica,  Calder’s sculpture should be understood in the context of the Spanish Civil War and was intended to have a political meaning. At the time, Almadén was controlled by Republican forces and under an extended siege by General Franco’s fascist troops. The inherent beauty of the liquid metal was well understood, but its toxicity was not. Today, the fountain resides in the Fundacio Joan Miro in Barcelona, Spain, and continues to pump pure mercury, though now it does so behind a pane of glass to protect viewers from touching or breathing fumes produced by this toxic work of art.  Catch the funicular up Montjic Hill from Paral·lel station, turn left on exiting the station, and the Joan Miro Foundation building is about 100m on the other side of the road. The fountain is located inside of the gallery and you will need to pay 12 euro to gain entry."
53,"Ronda, Spain","Ronda, Spain",Three bridges and one giant canyon make up this fantastic Spanish settlement.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ronda-spain,"Looking like something springing from the imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien, the city of Ronda, Spain is perched high atop the two cliff faces of El Tajo canyon as though a fissure opened and swallowed the center of the city. Romans established a settlement at Ronda nearly two centuries before the reign of Julius Caesar, and it has survived through several invading forces until the present. The Guadalevín River, which courses through the site,  has carved a deep canyon that divides the historic urban center. The walls of the canyon are sheer drops to the river over 100 meters below and the white stone buildings are built to the very edge of the chasm. Connecting the two parts of the city are three bridges, the Roman Bridge (also called Puente Viejo), the Arab Bridge (also called Puente San Miguel), and the New Bridge (Puente Nuevo). The first two are so-called to recognize the regimes that built them. The New Bridge was completed in 1793 by the town’s Spanish inhabitants. The bridges are impressive feats of stonework with massive columns reaching down into the canyon, and with ornate roofs, giving the city the multicultural feel that its several conquerors brought with them. In addition to its impressive geology, Ronda is home to Spain’s oldest bullfighting ring, and is a proud supporter of the sport. In fact the fantastical city is well-known for this spectacle, so that several prominent writers and others, including Ernest Hemingway and Orson Welles, have lived in or visited the city."
54,Bunkers of Carmel,"Barcelona, Spain",These secluded and abandoned anti-aircraft defenses have become one the most scenic viewpoints in Barcelona.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bunkers-del-carmel,"Anyone looking to get an incredible bird’s-eye view of Barcelona, Catalonia, need look no further than the hilltop ruins of the Bunkers del Carmel. Built as anti-aircraft fortifications in 1938, during the Spanish Civil War, the bunkers atop the hill of Turó de la Rovira were situated so that they could survey the entirety of the city. Large 105 mm cannons were mounted on the concrete and masonry defenses and helped protect Barcelona from further bombing. After the war, the guns were removed and the bunkers were simply left to crumble. Yet the view from the site was too lovely to stay neglected for long and eventually the old bunkers became known as a beautiful, if a bit remote, place to take in the historic city. In the 2000s, as the popularity of the site grew, the bunkers received a renovation as officials wanted to make it more appealing to tourists as well as celebrate the ancient Iberian settlement that is also nearby. The formerly secret site now regularly sees visitors, but is secluded enough that it is often still fairly private. Further restoration of the site began again this year, but the site is expected to reopen in April."
55,Montjuïc Cemetery,"Barcelona, Spain",This cemetery features modernist statues as strange as its name.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/montjuic-cemetery,"The Montjuïc Cemetery is a unique place, to be sure, with unusual and modernist graves. Opened in March of 1883, Montjuïc is the biggest cemetery in Barcelona. It’s placed on the top of Montjuïc, which itself is a nice little mountain beneath the Mediterranean sea. You can find there famous graves in the cemetery, like those of Catalan leader Lluis Companys (1882-1940), Spanish anarchist militant Buenaventura Durruti (1896-1936), artist Joan Miró (1893-1983), and many more. If you walk to the top you can see a crematorium from Roman times. The journey to the crematorium is a very long walk. It takes more than 3 hours to tour the entire cemetery. In a silent western wing of the cemetery is el Fossar de la Pedrera (the Grave of the Quarry). An estimated 4,000 people were buried there after their execution by the Franco regime following the fall of Barcelona to fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War. The quarry contains memorials to the victims of fascism and the holocaust, Lluis Companys (the last president of Catalunya before the civil war) and, recently, a monument commemorating the aspirations of the social revolution of 1936. El Fossar de la Pedrera is a moving and melancholy place. Walking through beautiful modernist graves, surrounded by pines and watching the sea. Experiencing this cemetery is widely considered to be one of the most enjoyable experiences in Barcelona. The Cementiri de Montjuïc is a little difficult to reach. The easiest way to get there is to take the 21 bus from the Jardins de Walter Benjamin at the Place de les Drassanes, near (but not at) the southern end of Las Ramblas. But bus will stop at the bottom of the cemetery, after which the 107 bus can take you to the top--this is advantageous as the cemetery is nearly vertical! The more adventurous approach would be to walk about Montjuic until coming across the cemetery from the top. If you do that, do not assume you can walk back toward Las Ramblas/along the sea front. It's all closed off for the Port Authority and there are no safe footpaths along or near the highway after the bus stop."
56,Chocolate Museum,"Barcelona, Spain",Gaze upon chocolate sculptures depicting everything from chariot races to Gaudí's famous church at this shrine to sweets.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chocolate-museum,"Five hundred years ago, chocolate in the form of cocoa beans first came ashore in Europe. Coming into port in Spain, Hernan Cortes and his conquistadors brought the spiced treat with them after pillaging the Mayan and Aztec empires of Central America, where cocoa beans had been used to create chocolate variants for over 3,000 years. In honor of this trans-Atlantic transfer, the Barcelona Confectionery Guild has set up the Chocolate Museum to tell the story of chocolate and its modernization. Although the history section of the museum is in no way perfect, visitors get a general trajectory of chocolate’s evolution, moving from bitter water to the stunningly detailed sculptures that fill the museum. By using the statues to visibly depict modern chocolate innovation, the arc of the history of chocolate feels fairly complete. Upon entrance to the museum, guests are greeted by a massive white chocolate ape named Snowy, along with their own chocolate bar as part of their admission. As they munch on the confectioner’s chocolate, guests walk past glass-encased sculptures made entirely of chocolate. The sculptures include some famous cultural icons such as Minnie Mouse and Louis Armstrong. However, the bulk of work focuses on Spanish architecture, proudly featuring Sagrada Familia, one of Gaudi’s famous houses, and creatures from Parc Guell. Combining history, the world’s favorite treat, and a small dash of Spanish pride, the museum offers something for every chocolate lover.

57,Sobrino de Botin,"Madrid, Spain","The oldest restaurant in the world is this old-world Spanish eatery, still known for its suckling pig.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sobrino-de-botin,"In a world where a restaurant existing for as long as a decade qualifies as a small miracle, Spain’s Sobrino de Botin, which has been serving for over 200 years, is almost unbelievable. Recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s oldest restaurant still in operation, Sobrino de Botin was first opened back in 1725. At the time that the restaurant opened (in the ground floor of an inn), it was actually up to the guests to bring their own meat and ingredients, which were then cooked in the eatery’s facilities. After the original owners died childless, the restaurant passed to their nephew, which is when it got its current name, which translates to “Nephew of Botin,” of course. Over the next two hundred plus years, the trends of the city changed, but Sobrino de Botin never stopped cooking (after it was able to start cooking for people that is). Today the restaurant covers four floors of seating, each with its own Spanish theme, from the brick cellar to the fancier Felipe IV room. Even as the tourists began to flock to the restaurant, as will happen once Guinness gets its paws on you, the cuisine has stayed remarkably true to its Spanish roots, with the whole suckling pig, which is prepared in a brick oven, being the stand-out dish. The Sobrino de Botin likely saw its finest moment when it was mentioned by Ernest Hemingway in The Sun Also Rises, and it is rumored that the famous artist Francisco de Goya worked there as a young man. However, its legacy is clearly thanks to its astounding age rather than to its ties to art and literature."
58,Casa Vicens,"Barcelona, Spain","Step inside the first house designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, considered to be one of the first Art Nouveau buildings.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casa-vicens,"Any visitor to Barcelona is likely familiar with the unique, often whimsical work of architect Antoni Gaudí. His buildings are a beloved, defining aspect of the city. Now, visitors can become even more familiar with the iconic architect by stepping inside the first house he designed. Casa Vicens is one of seven properties built by the Catalan modernist in Barcelona and its surrounding areas recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. UNESCO considers its distinctive style an “outstanding creative contribution to the architectural heritage of modern times.” From the tiles painted with French marigolds on the first two floors to its domed rooftop (which provides a beautiful view of the neighborhood), Gaudí’s first major architectural project laid the groundwork for his remarkable oeuvre and paved the way for Catalan Modernism. It’s now a museum, which opened in November 2017 and boasts 15 rooms restored with extensive research and input from descendants of the original tenants. It features a collection of furniture made by Gaudí and 32 paintings by the Spanish painter Francesc Torrescassana i Sallarés. Stockbroker Manuel Vicens i Montaner commissioned the house, which was constructed between 1883 and 1888 as a summer home and expanded in 1925 by Barcelona architect Joan Baptista Serra de Martínez. The structure contains a myriad of styles which reflect the innovative architect’s inspirations from subjects like nature to oriental and neoclassical architecture."
59,Palacio de Cristal,"Madrid, Spain",Madrid's romantically ornate crystal palace has been offering shelter to plants and art for over a century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palacio-de-cristal,"Built to mirror a similar structure in London, which was installed just over 30 years earlier, Madrid’s Palacio de Cristal (Crystal Palace) is a lovely architectural jewel that recalls an era when spaces were built simply to be beautiful. The ornate glass and steel greenhouse that sits on the edge of a lake in Buen Retiro Park was finished in 1887 as a space to exhibit arts and wonders in a setting that was both lovingly baroque and still naturally stunning. From the high glass dome to the bright red brick foundation, the building is a thing of beauty. Since the walls are glass, the park’s lush green surrounds can also be appreciated in addition to whatever exhibition is on display inside. The palace is also outfitted with a boat landing on the waters of the park’s small lake and an entrance fitted out with classically styled columns. Since the palace is essentially an elaborate greenhouse it is no wonder that the first exhibition in the space was a display of exotic Vietnamese plants that were brought into Spain for the event. The intention was originally to continue displaying wondrous plants in the space, but as time went on the palace began showing more art than flora. Today, the Crystal Palace can still be visited by anyone who wants to take in the art on display inside or the natural vistas outside, or both at the same time.  Although the crystal palace is a beautiful site to visit at any time or season of the year, it is particularly impressive to see during fall, with the autumnal light and backdrop of the trees shedding their leaves."
60,Barcelona Erotic Museum,"Barcelona, Spain",An unusual stroll through gentlemen's erotica demonstrates that pornography is timeless.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-de-la-erotica-de-barcelona,"If the burning sun of the Catalan coast hasn’t already raised your temperature enough and you’d like to get your blood pumping a little faster, a tour of Barcelona’s most aphrodisiacal museum, the Museu de l’Eròtica de Barcelona, will do the trick. A common destination for both kink enthusiasts, museum lovers, and giggling couples, the museum itself appears to be modest, the collection a small but intriguing hotchpotch. The erotic artifacts and contraptions gathered in this tiny building transmit the slightly uncomfortable feeling that they were all owned and cherished by the same collector. You imagine a debaucherous explorer, obsessed with the idea of Orientalism and its voluptuous sensuality, the flexible bodies of Kama Sutra or Japanese Shinga, and pornographic woodcut prints presenting the ordinary sexual practices of the Edo Era. Some may find this museum too small and a bit shabby, but witnessing the sexual habits of our ancestors is always a fascinating experience. An awkward time warp where one’s realized kink can be recorded for the pleasure of others is an ageless concept. In that sense, Barcelona’s Museum of Eroticism can be envisioned more as an archive of mankind’s desires and fantasies than a sultry tourist trap. Metro: Liceu"
61,Sewers of Barcelona,"Barcelona, Spain","Barcelona's historic 19th-century sewers, whose foundations were laid in medieval times, are open to the public for exploring.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sewers-of-barcelona,"Barcelona is known as the birthplace of Catalan “modernisme”, due to the architectural style pioneered there at the turn of the century. However, exploring below the city’s streets betrays the many layers of architecture in its history. An aqueduct-based sewer system was introduced to Barcino, an ancient Roman colony, because when it rained the whole city would flood. Much later, in 1364 when the city had become known as Barcelona, medieval architects expanded on the sewers and ran water beneath La Rambla, the city’s most famous street. It wasn’t until 1886 that Pere García Faria designed the first modern sewers in the city, intended to serve Eixample, the bourgeois proto-suburb being expanded outside the medieval walls. These, too, expanded on and connected with the sewers of previous eras. Today some of these tunnels are still in use. Most are inaccessible to the public, but thanks to a dedicated group of Barcelonian tour guides, the sewers are open for adventuring. The best remnants are located below Passeig San Joan, a strategic avenue which linked Gracia, a formerly independent village, with Parc de la Ciutadella, the site of the 1888 Universal Exhibition. Beneath these streets a whole world opens up: The quiet flow of water in the dank sewers is illuminated by dim fluorescent lights while the city’s hustle and bustle continues on above. The visits are facilitated by La Fabrica del Sol, an institution responsible for educating the public on Barcelona’s environmental activities. Small groups (no more than ten people) are guided by locals who explain the evolution of the aquatic tunnels, their technical processes and engineering, as well as lore and curiosities. Metro: the L4 and L5 Verdaguer. Buses: 6, 15, 19, 33, 34, 43, 44, 50, 51, 55. Visits must be booked through La Fabrica del Sol. Some urban explorers report successfully traversing the tunnels themselves, but at their own risk."
62,Tibidabo,"Barcelona, Spain",Mountain where Jesus was first tempted by the Devil.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tibidabo,"A mountain overlooking Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, Tibidabo stands more than 500 meters tall. The highest peak anywhere in the Serra de Collserola range, Tibidabo is home to an amusement park, a telecommunications tower, and Sagrat Cor, a Catholic church. Sagrat Cor is perhaps the most fitting of Tibidabo’s attractions as this is the site where local legend says the devil tempted Jesus. The name Tibidabo derives from the Latin Vulgate Bible verses, Matthew 4:9 and Luke 4:6. The phrase, tibi dabo, means I will give to you. It was supposedly said to Jesus by the devil as they looked down from a mountain on the kingdoms of the world. The name of Barcelona’s hill, then, refers to how it is the tallest anywhere around. Designed by Enric Sagnier, the church took about 60 years to build. At the top of the church, Sagrat Cor, is a sculpture of the Sacred Heart by Josep Miret Llopart. Tibidabo can be reached by a funicular railway, by bus, and by car. The railway, built in 1901, was the first of its kind in Spain. The amusement park is also the oldest of its kind in the area. Constructed in 1899, the park offers more than thirty different rides, some of them dating back many decades. A few of the original attractions are also still operating, including the Museu d’Autòmates (Mechanical Museum). Tibidabo can be reached by a funicular railway, by bus, and by car."
63,Templo de Debod,"Madrid, Spain","An ancient Egyptian temple in the middle of Madrid, Spain.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/templo-de-debod,"The Templo de Debod, or Temple of Debod, is an ancient Egyptian temple bizarrely out of place in the heart of Madrid, near the Plaza de España. Gifted from Egypt to Spain in 1968 in thanks for Spain’s contributions to saving historic sites that would be flooded when the Aswan High Dam was completed, it originally stood in Egypt’s Nile Valley since the 4th century BCE, dedicated to the Egyptian gods Amun and Isis. The temple is located in the middle of a pleasant park, Parque de la Montaña, and surrounded by a pool that reflects its image. It is striking by day and famously magnificent at sunset. The park is on a hilltop allowing for panoramic views of Madrid. By day, tourists frequent the temple while noisy wild quaker parakeets originally from Argentina shriek in the tops of the surrounding chestnut trees. At night, a different crowd arrives: young people drinking in preparation for a night on the town. Vendors snake through clumps of 20-somethings sitting on the grass to offer cans of beer for a couple of euros—mildly illegal, but apparently without repercussion. The temple is lit golden at night, shining beautifully over this buzzing scene, and the lights of the royal palace are visible in the distance. Any time of night or day is appropriate for a visit to the Templo de Debod. Admission to this outdoor monument is free, and photography is permitted—in fact, some hold that there is no better place to photograph the sunset. The temple is a short walk from the Plaza de España metro stop."
64,Stockholm Metro Art Gallery,"Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm's decidedly unique public transit system has doubled as the world's longest art gallery for decades.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stockholm-metro-art-gallery,"The Stockholm Metro has more than one hundred stations, and at least ninety of them have elaborate art installations as part of their status quo decor. The subway system was created in 1941, and first opened for public use in 1950. The Metro has since grown to incorporate more than one hundred stations, only one of which is not in use. Travelling by subway in Stockholm is like being in a personal, mobile art  gallery that allows everyone in transit to experience the beauty of incredible mosaics, paintings, installations, and sculptures. It evokes feelings of being part of a modern-day archeological expedition, full of undiscovered secrets and surprises. The best part? Admission to this gallery costs nothing except for the train ticket, which has been extremely well-received by citizens of Sweden, as well as foreign visitors. In the early 1980’s, an outbreak of graffiti and vandalism threatened the beauty and the safety of the unique artwork in a number of stations, but eventually the vandals took their art elsewhere, allowing the gallery to exist unfettered. During that time however, the government spent an exorbitant amount of money in order to protect the subway from desecration."
65,Codex Gigas (The Devil's Bible),"Stockholm, Sweden","An illuminated manuscript comprising the life's work of a lone monk, inexplicably decorated with a portrait of Satan himself.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/codex-gigas-the-devil-s-bible,"The largest Medieval manuscript in the world is believed to have been the work of a single monk in Bohemia (in modern Czechia). Nevertheless, it’s not its 620 pages at three-feet in size that makes it remarkable; it’s the Devil contained therein. Literally meaning “giant book,” the Codex Gigas was created in the 13th century and originally stored in the Benedictine monastery at Podlažice. The manuscript contains not only the New and Old Testaments but also an assortment of other shorter texts addressing matters of extreme practicality for the time: exorcism, grammar, a calendar, and medical works, to name a few. Everything within the book was handwritten by a single, anonymous monk. The National Library of Sweden puts this massive undertaking into perspective: “If the scribe worked for six hours a day and wrote six days a week this means that the manuscript could have taken about five years to complete. If the scribe was a monk he may only have been able to work for about three hours a day, and this means that the manuscript could have taken ten years to write. As the scribe may also have ruled the lines to guide the writing before he began to write (it probably took several hours to rule one leaf), this extends the period it took to complete the manuscript. The scribe also decorated the manuscript, so this all means that the manuscript probably took at least 20 years to finish, and could even have taken 30.” These elements alone are enough to qualify the stunning manuscript as a wonder of the world. Yet the most bewitching element of the Codex Gigas is a single page of illumination that defies explanation, tucked away within the tome. Spanning nearly the entire face of a page is a full-color rendering of the Dark Lord himself. Speculation, plausible and otherwise, abounds as to how the unholiest feature possible made its way into this most sacred text, but answers remain elusive. Precisely because of this tension, everyone loves the Codex Gigas – or, the Devil’s Bible, if you prefer. The manuscript originally travelled to Stockholm in the late 16th century, plundered from the Holy Roman Emperor’s castle by the Swedish army during the Thirty Years War. This massive tome currently resides behind glass in a room on the second floor of the King’s Library (also called the National Library of Sweden) in Humlegården (“Humle” meaning “hops,” suggesting royalty grew hops there for their own beer, “gården” meaning “courtyard”), a lovely park in the posh Stockholm neighborhood of Östermalm.  The manuscript is not kept open and it is kept in a fairly dark room because of possible damage from light. There is a movie describing the history of the Codex in Swedish with English subtitles playing on a loop. For even more on the Codex Gigas, continue reading its feature as Atlas Obscura’s Object of Intrigue here. Update as of August 2022: The book is still on display but the inside is not for preservation reasons.  You must leave backpacks and large bags in the lockers next to the cafe on the entry (fifth) floor. Take the elevator down to the second floor and there is a room on the left side where the Codex is kept."
66,R1 Nuclear Reactor,"Stockholm, Sweden","Sweden's first nuclear reactor, R1, can be visited 25 meters underground.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/r1-nuclear-reactor,"During the post World War II race among countries to arm themselves with nuclear weapons, some risky decisions were made. Among them was the building of Sweden’s first nuclear reactor, Reaktor 1, or R1, buried 25 meters directly underneath the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and within a 1 km of about 40,000 people. Nonetheless, in the heady days of the Cold War and nuclear armament it was deemed a tolerable risk for the scientists at KTH to be able to study reactions. Attempting to “make something with neutrons,” scientists brought the reactor online and on July 13, 1954, the reactor produced Sweden’s first nuclear reaction. R1 continued to be used for most of Sweden’s nuclear research until the 1970s, when the concern over the reactor proximity to Stockholm led to its closure. The reactor hall has since been opened to visitors and as of April 2007 the reactor hall can be visited from the KTH Museum of Science and Technology. The reactor is now a popular venue for modern art and dance performances. Update April 2017: The reactor is generally only open to visitors a couple of times per year, in conjunction with events, and is currently not open to the public at all while working with infrastructure. Update October 2018: The reactor is open once more! It can be visited during special events like the Stockholm Open House."

Once inside, you’ll encounter a hall with large, sheepskin-covered wooden benches and walls decorated with weapons, shields, and furs. Welcome to Aifur, a restaurant devoted to Viking food, drink, and decor. Those who booked in advance will get announced by horn and receive a loud welcome from the other diners. When you sit down and look through the menu, you’ll notice that each item is tied to Viking history and legend, with many dishes utilizing ingredients available during the Viking Age (800 to 1050 CE). Diners can feast on beautifully arranged meals featuring root vegetables, reindeer heart, and lamb, quenching their thirsts with mead, ales flavored with bog myrtle and fir, and sweet juices. Aifur is the brain child of E-type, a famous musician in the Eurodance genre, who opened the restaurant in 2011. He can still be seen eating there regularly and generally likes being recognized. So don’t feel bad walking up to talk to him.  Make sure to book in advance if you want to book a seat here. You can generally walk in for the mead bar but depending on the season it might be necessary to book a month in advance for dinner."
68,Storkyrkobadet,"Stockholm, Sweden",A hidden bathhouse in one of Stockholm's oldest and busiest neighborhoods is open to anyone who can find it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/storkyrkobadet,"This tiny public bath is hiding in plain sight in the most touristy part of Stockholm. Storkyrkobadet is located in a vault, in the basement of a building dating back to the 17th century in Stockholm’s Old Town. The building was originally a Dominican convent during which time the vault served alternately as a coal and wine cellar. In the 1890s, the building was converted to a primary school, and the vault became the baths for the students. It would take another half century before a sauna was built and the bath was opened to the public. The bath is still old fashioned in many ways, with its architecture and interior unchanged since it was first built. It consists of just one shallow pool and a number of tiny tubs where visitors can sit and relax. Throughout the years, Storkyrkobadet has become a popular meeting point for the gay community, probably because of the separate opening hours for men and women. Sweden’s most famous gay couple, Jonas Gardell and Mark Levengood, met here in the 1980s. Despite its popularity and history, Storkyrkobadet’s existence is in danger. The city planned to close it in the ’80s but thanks to a volunteer organization called Föreningen De Glada Badarnait (“Society of Merry Bathers”) it was able to live on—at least for another few decades. Facing increasing costs, as of 2016 the future of this hidden oasis is again uncertain, but a small group of enthusiasts are doing everything in their power to keep it open. Update as of February 2020: Storkyrkobadet is closed for renovations until 2021. Update as of August 2022: The pool is still closed with no clear opening scheduled at the moment.  Storkyrkobadet is open between 5 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. for men on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays and women on Mondays and Thursdays."
69,Vasa Museum,"Stockholm, Sweden",It houses the remains of a 17th-century version of the Titanic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vasa-museum,"Seventeenth-century Sweden was an up-and-coming state with great ambitions. Colonial expansion was on the mind of every royal, and for Sweden, the Navy was to be the backbone of any successful grand strategy. A ship called Vasa was built as the flagship of the new Swedish navy. King Gustavus Adolphus himself commissioned the ship. The ship was to be a giant floating fortress. The combined weight of the ammunition fired from one side of the boat was 588 pounds, making it the most well-armed ship to date. The Vasa’s armament included 48 light cannons, two additional large cannons of an older design, eight “three-pounders,” and six large howitzers for use during boarding action. All this heavy firepower was crammed onto both the ship’s lower and upper floors, making for a somewhat top-heavy design. Construction problems were evident from the beginning, and early stability tests showed the ship was in constant danger of capsizing. Nonetheless, under pressure from the royal court, the ship was completed on a very tight schedule. On August 10, 1628, the Vasa was deemed complete and launched on its maiden voyage. It managed to sail for a little less than one nautical mile. A gust of wind made it keel to its port side and water started pouring through the open gun ports onto its lower deck. The ship sank in matter of minutes, in full view of a crowd that had gathered to witness the launching, including foreign ambassadors and royal officials. The loss of the Vasa was a blow to both the prestige of Sweden and its economy—one from which its navy never fully recovered. Though the Swedish court looked long and hard for a guilty party, none were found, and the official investigator, upon being asked the cause of the sinking, replied “only God knows.” As the ship sank in only 32 meters of water, several early salvage attempts were made, all of them unsuccessful. The ship’s location was eventually lost to history, until it was relocated in the 1950s under the efforts of amateur archaeologist Anders Franzén. Vasa was lifted to the surface in April of 1961 after being underwater for some 333 years. Thousands of artifacts and the remains of at least 15 people were found in and around the hull of the the Vasa. (Ironically it was the heavy pollution of the Swedish bay that killed wood-eating microorganisms and helped preserve the ship.) The Vasa Museum was opened in 1990 to permanently house the remains of the ship.  Walking from the central station takes about 30 minutes, and walking from the Karlaplan station takes about 10 minutes. Bus 69 leaves from the Central Station, bus 44 leaves from Karlaplan. You can also take tram line 7. The ferry leaves from Slussen all year round and also from Nybroplan during the summer."

The 360-degree tower of books at the top is a bibliophile’s temple to reading in-the-round. The graceful rotunda is open to the public, who can climb to the top of the stacks and peer down on the collections below. The library is an example of Nordic Classicism, pioneered by Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund in the 1920s. The slightly chilly façade is, at the same time, oddly inviting, as if to say “we are here to work, but all are welcome.” This style was sometimes known as “Swedish Grace,” a simplified and accessible classicism that had great influence on everything from furniture design to sculpture. Beyond its unique architectural design, the Stadsbiblioteket contains over 2 million volumes and more than 2.4 million audio tapes, and was one of the first libraries to allow direct access to the stacks without the help of a retrieving librarian.  It also hosts the International Library, housed in two stories of an annex behind the main building. The collection catalogs books in more than 100 languages, with more than 50,000 titles available to loan. As of September 2022: The library is currently being renovated. Stockholm’s Public Library is along the northeast corner of Observatorielunden park in Stockholm's Vasastaden district. It’s open Monday through Friday from 10am to 9pm (except Tuesday, when it opens at noon), Saturday and Sunday from 11am to 5pm, and is closed on holidays. It’s a library, so of course it’s free."
71,Victoriahuset (Victoria House),"Stockholm, Sweden",A rare surviving Victorian greenhouse designed specifically to house giant water lilies.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/victoriahuset,"Hidden near the royal Brunnsviken Lake is the Bergian Garden, an 18th-century academic botanical garden. The garden’s most intriguing structure is its unique 20th-century aquatic greenhouse, which was built specifically to house tropical lilies. This greenhouse is not only unusual in Sweden, but also in most of Europe, as very few original Victoria greenhouses have survived since the time of their popularity. The greenhouse was a brainchild of Bergianus Veit Wittrock, who had great scientific interest in aquatic plants and algae. After much lobbying, he managed to get approval from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1899, and the greenhouse was quickly erected. The literal and figurative centerpiece of this greenhouse is the Victoria Lily, the largest waterlily species in the world. Wittrock also planted many other species of lilies and aquatic plants inside, which then were bred and studied in this simulated Amazonian environment. This was not an easy task in the early 1900s, especially in the Swedish winter, when the greenhouse had to be kept warm with coal fires. The structure itself is built from cast-iron and dome-shaped glass, an incredibly heavy construction that is disproportionately vulnerable to the humid climate inside the greenhouse. It was restored in the 1980s and the early 2000s. It’s currently being recognized as a national monument of high protection value.  The greenhouse is open from May 1 to September 30 on weekdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and weekends 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. It's closed on weekends for Midsummer Eve, Midsummer Day, and Sunday after Midsummer Eve."

Installed in 2006, the rainbow-colored installation uses the windows in the upper portion of the 20-story spire to project whatever hue is ordered up by people via a smartphone app. Either standing on site or even through a streaming webcam, amateur painters of light who want to make their temporary mark on the Stockholm skyline can choose which floor they would like to color and then create a custom color using a mixable RGB interface. Even without a smartphone, people can call a free number and paint the tower using just their keypad. The tower’s lights can be seen from all around southern Stockholm and the creators hope that the work can stand as a statement on the power of democracy and the power of the public. On some level this installation is successful in this endeavor, but it is also simply a cool bit of city-hacking that can make citizens and visitors alike connect with an often alienating urban environment. Colour by Numbers is right next to the metro station Telefonplan on one of the red lines south of Stockholm central station."

There is a bird’s nest, an elevated cabin, a red shack called the Blue Cone, a flying saucer, and the Mirrorcube. Mirrorcube has come to be the most well known room, covered on all six sides with mirrors that reflect the forest. As a symbol of the guiding environmental principles, visitors staying in Mirrorcube melt into the landscape while enjoying the ultra-modern and minimalist interior. Besides the five rooms, the Treehotel also features a sauna, and has plans to expand to a total of 24 rooms."
74,Kungsträdgården Metro Station,"Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm's deepest subway station is also a stunning ecological wonder.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kungstradgarden-metro-station,"Beneath Stockholm runs one of the world’s most beautiful subway systems. Since the 1950s, the majority of the stations have been decorated with paintings, art installations, sculptures and mosaics created by more than 150 artists. The Kungsträdgården station is not only one of the most impressive artistically, it is also the deepest and, as researchers have recently discovered, home to its own self-sufficient ecosystem. The Kungsträdgården metro station was opened in 1977 after considerable controversy. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, large swaths of central Stockholm were being demolished and replaced with modern buildings. Stockholmers were seriously fed up with all this construction, and when plans to build the new Kungsträdgården subway station were announced, things got heated. The planned entrance to the new station was to be located in a park and would require cutting down a number of old elm trees. Protests ensued, people chained themselves to the trees, and the demonstrators clashed with police. The residents won, however, and the planned entrance was moved to a less objectionable location. Since then, all kinds of good things have been happening 112 feet below ground in Kungsträdgården station. Visually, it is one of the most striking stations below Stockholm. Sections of exposed rock reach up to arched ceilings decorated with colorful mosaics. Original artworks hang from or are painted directly onto the walls. Relics from some of the old houses torn down during the redevelopment of central Stockholm also appear in the station: old statues, intricately carved columns, old water fountains, and more. Further reflecting the above-ground history of the area are replicas of the statues that once existed on the grounds of Makalös Palace, a magnificent mansion and gardens that once occupied the area now above the station, but was destroyed by a fire in 1825. Kungsträdgården has also become famous for an altogether less obvious feature. Since its construction, the station has developed its own self-sufficient ecosystem, with organisms more commonly found in caves and grottos than in subway systems. In 2012, while the station was closed for rail work, a team of researchers went to take samples from the naked granite walls. They soon found a whole array of life, from crane flies to rare moss and tiny insects and worm-like animals. Most surprisingly, they also discovered a rare cave dwarf spider, Lessertia dentichelis, which shouldn’t even exist in northern Europe. It’s believed the 3-millimeter arachnid hitched a ride on construction equipment brought from central Europe during the construction of the subway. Later, in 2016, scientists also discovered a previously unknown fungus on the station walls. The ecosystem is fed by the station’s artificial lighting, as well as the chalk that drips down from the humanmade ceiling. Even the passengers who walk through the station each day provide a constant source of energy-rich molecules, such as hair and other human detritus.  Kungsträdgården station is located in the Norrmalm district. It is the end station of lines 10 and 11 of the Stockholm metro."

76,Birthplace of the Stockholm Syndrome,"Stockholm, Sweden","Now a hotel, this former bank was the site of a robbery that spawned a psychological phenomenon.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/birthplace-of-the-stockholm-syndrome,"The robbery at Norrmalmstorg in 1973 took an unexpected turn when the hostages started sympathizing with their captors. In an instant the Stockholm Syndrome was born. The corner at the intersection between Norrmalmstorgsgatan and Hamngatan in Stockholm was once the location for one of Kreditbanken’s (The Credit Bank) offices. On an August day in 1973, Jan-Erik “Janne” Olsson, on leave from prison, went into the bank armed with a submachine gun and tried to rob it. The police were on the scene right away and two officers went inside. Olsson opened fire, injuring one of them in the hand and the jaw. He then ordered the other policeman to sit in a chair and “sing something.” He chose Lonesome Cowboy by Elvis Presley. Olsson took four persons in the staff hostage and barricaded himself in the vault. He demanded that his friend Clark Olofsson, at the time imprisoned, be brought there and his demand was met. A few days into the  robbery attempt, the police drilled holes through the wall to the vault to take pictures. Olofsson fired his gun at the forensic officers photographing the scene and wounded one of them in the face and the hand. He threatened to kill the hostages if any attempts to release gas into the vault were made, and he now and then forced the hostages to stand up with slip knots around their necks so that they would be strangled, as insurance against these attempts. In the end, Olsson and Olofsson surrendered after half an hour and none of the hostages sustained any permanent injuries. During and after the attempted robbery, the hostages showed sympathy for the robbers and criticized the police for their actions. The Swedish Prime Minister talked with the offenders and the hostages during the drama and one of the latter defended their captors, saying that the police had opened fire first. Some of them also insisted that the robbers should get safe passage to the car that they had demanded. This behavior, unheard of at the time, stirred interest in the academic world. It was the criminologist and psychiatrist Nils Bejerot who was working for the police at the time that coined the expression “Norrmalmstorgssyndromet” (The Norrmalmstorg Syndrome). This later became known as Stockholm Syndrome."

78,Uppland Runic Inscription 53,"Stockholm, Sweden",An ancient Viking runestone hidden in plain view in Stockholm's old town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/uppland-runic-inscription-53,"The Viking runestone embedded on a street corner in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm, is believed to be older than the city itself. Though its origin is unknown, it’s estimated to date back nearly a millennia, to the 11th century. Officially called “Uppland Runic Inscription 53,” the Gamla stan stone is prominently located at the intersection of Prästgatan and Kåkbrinken streets, but can be hard to spot without a guide as there are no signs or plaques pointing out its significance. It’s about waist height behind the street corner post. The stone depicts a serpent body in decorative winding loops, and an inscription that has been partially translated as “Torsten and Frögunn had the stone erected after their son.” The name of the son is sadly lost. The female name, Frögunn, is a known pagan name, which lent a clue as to the origin of the text. It’s believed the stone was brought into Gamla stan from a neighboring area to be used as construction material. Inscription 53 is one of three runestones found in Stockholm’s old town. Another, known as “U 274” was originally found in a wall and is now displayed in the Museum of Medieval Stockholm. The third was found in a church stairway but has been lost to history."
79,Icehotel,"Kiruna, Sweden",The world's first ice hotel is still one of the most elaborate and beautiful.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/icehotel-2,"200 kilometers above the Arctic Circle in Sweden, about 17 kilometres from Kiruna, is a little village of Jukkasjarvi where dogs nearly outnumber the humans, but for a few months each year it becomes host to the world’s original “ice hotel,” which has been melting and being rebuilt since 1990. The 5,500 square meter Icehotel is rebuilt each year with snow, ice, and “snice,” a mixture of snow and ice that helps hold the whole place together like mortar. All of the frozen materials for the structures are taken from the waters of the nearby Torne River around December, and then the buildings return to the waterway when the site melts around April. The exact number of rooms varies from year to year but generally hovers around 65, with each chamber being a unique space designed by a visiting artist. Artists from all over the word vie annually for the opportunity to be among the year’s list of artisans invited to put their unique vision and skills to work in designing and decorating one of the rooms. It is art at once beautiful, practical, and as fleeting as a flake of snow. The destination is also popular among newlyweds who can tie the knot in the adjacent Ice Chapel, and then stay afterward to take advantage of the beauty of the hotel’s bridal suite. In addition to the artist designed rooms, the common spaces feature ice chandeliers, and crystal clear furnishings, with running fountains, tinkling ornamentation, statuary both peaceful and fierce, all crafted entirely of ice and snow. The original Icehotel is, well, pretty cool.  The hotel exists between December and Mid April, and is accessible by car, taxi, or shuttle service from Kiruna airport. The Icehotel site can be visited all year round, including a guided tour of the freezer warehouses used to store ice sculptures."
80,H.R. Giger Museum,"Gruyères, Switzerland","The bizarre visions of H.R. Giger, tucked away in a Swiss medieval city.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hr-giger-museum,"In the quaint medieval city of Gruyères, Switzerland, you may meander the cobblestone streets, visit a 13th Century Chateau and take in the stunning valley panoramas from the historic rampart walls. But a far more fascinating site here contrasts with the Swiss scenery and piques the modern curiosity. Along the way to the fromagerie is the H.R. Giger Museum. Even if the name H. R. Giger doesn’t mean anything to you, chances are you are familiar with his best known creation. H. R. Giger is the mind behind the titular monsters from the Alien movie franchise, among many other works frightening works of art. Swiss-born, Giger fell in love with the village at an exhibition there in the 1990s, and now the town’s medieval walls house his museum dedicated to his art, it contains the world’s largest collection of his works. The Museum’s interior was designed entirely by Giger himself. The Museum is intentionally dark, grim, and slightly disturbing: stepping inside feels like entering an alien’s lair. His oeuvre is available for view, including paintings, drawings, even furniture. The disparity between bucolic Switzerland and the obsessive, bizarre works of Giger will lend a Surreal tint to a day spent in Gruyères. While you’re in the area, be sure to visit the Museum’s HR Giger Bar open 10:00-8:30 daily, opposite the museum. The ceiling is like the inside of a ribcage, with vertebrae twisting along its vaulted ceiling. A beautiful panoramic photograph of the museum can be seen at the museum’s website. From Zurich HB (main train station) it’s an easy two and a half-hour trip to Gruyères, first to Fribourg, then a second change of trains in Bulle. There you can catch the RegioExpress towards Montbovon for the last 20-minutes to Gruyeres. From Geneva, it's about the same distance as from Zurich, it’s a lovely run along Lake Geneva to Montreux. There, you can catch a classic Swiss hill-climbing train to Montbovon. There, a ride on the RegioExpress train to Gruyeres (direction Broc Fabrique) is a total of two and a half hours of breathtaking scenery, particularly the hill climb out of Montreux."
81,Berggasthaus Aescher Wildkirchli,"Wasserauen, Switzerland",This 170-year-old Swiss guesthouse built into the side of a mountain is best accessed by a cable car.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/berggasthaus-aescher-wildkirchli,"This gorgeous guesthouse and restaurant is quite literally built into a cliff, and its back wall is made up of the rock itself. Its precarious perch makes it difficult to get to, and it’s only accessible after a steep hike along a mountain path or via cable car (the piano in the living room was brought in by helicopter). It’s been around for 170 years, and was originally a home for farmers; the guestbook goes back to 1940. Open from May through November, the guesthouse uses only rainwater, and there are no showers. Weekends often bring in rowdy groups of Swiss hikers and live music that plays late into the night. It’s run by Claudia and Beny Knechtle-Wyss and their five children, plus it’s home to 35 sheep, 20 rabbits, 5 chickens, 3 pigs, a donkey, and a dog. The guesthouse (which no longer accepts guests and is now only a restaurant) is also just a short distance down the path from the Wildkirchli caves, which were inhabited by Neanderthals as far back as 40,000 years ago.  The caves later became the site of a hermitage. Take the Wasserauen-Ebenalp cable car. It costs 27 CHF per person for a roundtrip."
82,Hammetschwand Elevator,"Ennetbürgen, Switzerland",The tallest outdoor elevator in Europe rockets passengers on a dizzyingly precarious ride to the top of a mountain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hammetschwand-elevator,"Straddling the exposed rock face of Switzerland’s Mt. Bürgenstock is the towering Hammetschwand Elevator, the tallest outdoor lift in Europe, which shoots passengers from an underground boarding station into an open-air shaft leading to the top of the mountain in less than a minute. The Hammetschwand Lift was put into place to carry visitors over 3,700 foot above sea level to the beautiful vistas of Lake Lucerne. Created in 1905 by a popular hotel destination nearby, the elevator has survived both world wars, the elements, and a wood-to-steel conversion to remain a world-record holding attraction. Originally the precarious elevator compartment was made of nothing more than wood and sheet metal which would be drawn up the 500 foot shaft, which was constructed of equally questionable materials. At the time, the ride took up to three minutes to complete. Today, after multiple overhauls, the elevator is made of expertly engineered metal and glass, yet somehow looks nonetheless rickety. In addition to the hair-raising heights that the glass-walled elevator reaches, the speed of the lift has also been increased and riders are now shot to the top of the shaft in less than a minute. The station at the top exits unto a bridge that leads to the mountaintop. Despite the sense of danger, the quick ride along the mountainside provides one of the most scenic views in all of the Swiss Alps, assuring that people will continue taking this ride for one hundred more years to come."
83,Saut de Brot,"Boudry, Switzerland",This lovely little bridge hidden in a Switzerland gorge is essentially a fairytale.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saut-de-brot,"Tucked away near the bottom of Switzerland’s Areuse Gorge is a nearly fantastical little bridge that looks straight out of a storybook. Of course the Saut de Brot, as it is known, is very real, and absolutely gorgeous. The lush Areuse Gorge in the region of Brot-Dessous in Switzerland was carved over millennia by what is now the Areuse river. The waters still rush along the bottom of the beautiful natural fissure, between tall walls of stone. The gorge is a popular nature spot for hikers who can traverse the trail that hugs the rocky cliffs. However, maybe the most stunning feature is the small bridge that was built to span the Areuse between the canyon walls. Known as the Saut de Brot, the bridge is a simple stone arch that is not overly dramatic in its construction, but is nonetheless singular enough to create an almost fantastical scene like something out of a Tolkien novel or a fairytale. Greenery grows above and around the bridge giving it an even more hidden and secluded feel, even with other hikers and visitors milling around. The actual origins of the bridge are unclear, although it seems like a recent addition despite the stone construction. It was obviously not built by elves, but it almost seems like it could have been. The hike to the bridge is easy and stunning. You can choose your entry point and decide whether you want to go on a simple, hour-long walk or whether you want to make a three-hour hike (there are also options in between). If you start at the train station in Noiraigue you have all options open."
84,St. Beatus Cave,"Beatenberg, Switzerland",Caves famous for the dragon-slaying saint who lived there.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-beatus-cave,"The legend of the cave revolves around its namesake, St. Beatus, a monk living around 100 AD, who chose the cave in which to spend his pious hermitage. To his annoyance, however, he discovered someone was already living there; a horrible dragon, who shot lasers of fire from his blazing eyes. St. Beatus, however, would not be run out of his cave so easily, and held his cross up to the beast, invoking the Holy Trinity. Thrown into a hysteric fit, the dragon ran down the cliff and threw himself into Lake Thun below, causing the placid clear water to rise and boil. So the legend goes. Like the Alps once were, the St. Beatus Cave is largely unexplored, but a small portion is open to the public. The setting of the cave is reason to visit alone - the beautiful old fashioned Swiss-style building that serves as the cave entrance clings to a vertical rock face. A waterfall seems to leak from beneath the structure, and into Lake Thun below. Bridges and walkways cross the waterfall, and as one climbs to the top, each vista is more inspiring than the last. The cave tour includes many charmingly named stalactites and stalagmites, and a number of underground waterfalls and lakes. Back in the light of day, a visit to the small museum is rewarded with cave bear artifacts discovered within Beatus, and a history of the dangers and delights of caving. For children and any with a fascination of the mystique of dragons, the Fable House is full of displays on dragons throughout history and Bernese Oberland legends.  By car: From Bern - Head for Thun; take the Thun North [Thun Nord] exit -Head for Gunten/lnterlaken From the Brünig - Take the A8 in the direction of Interlaken - Take the Gunten/Unterseen lane in the Rugen tunnel - Head for Gunten/Thun By bus: For information see www.stibus.ch By boat: For information see www.bls.ch/schiff Make sure to bring warm clothing as it can be surprisingly cold inside the caves, even in summer"
85,The Child Eater of Bern,"Bern, Switzerland","A nearly 500-year-old sculpture depicts a man eating a sack of babies, and no one is sure why.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/child-eater-bern,"Standing in the middle of Bern, Switzerland, is the Kindlifresser, or “Child Eater.” The fountain sculpture towers above the ground, a baby half stuffed into the giant’s mouth, and a sack full of three alarmed tots slung over his shoulder presumably for later snacking. The unsettling sculpture is no modern work of art; built in 1546, it is one of the oldest fountains in the city of Bern. Strangely, no one is exactly sure why it’s there. There are three main theories. The first and most unfortunate possibility is that the Kindlifresser was built as a sort of warning to the Jewish community of Bern. The Kindlifresser wears a hat that is strikingly similar to the yellow pointed Judenhut that Jews were forced to wear at that time. The second theory is that the terrifying Ogre is a depiction of Kronos, the Greek Titan. Kronos has arguably one of the most disturbing tales in Greek Mythology. Long story short, Kronos eats all his god children to keep them from taking over his throne. The final theory is that the Kindlifresser is supposed to be the older brother of Duke Berchtold, the founder of Bern. Apparently the jealousy of being overshadowed by his younger brother for so many years caused him to go mad, eventually sending him into a rage where he collected and ate the town’s children. (It would seem likely that this event would have been recorded in the town’s history books, which it is not.) It may of course be none of the above, and is simply a sort of boogie man from Switzerland’s Fastnacht, or ”Night of Fasting” festival, a way to remind the children of Bern to behave. Whatever the Kindlifresser represents, it has terrified Swiss children for nearly 500 years, and hopefully, will be there to terrify them for 500 years more."
86,Trift Bridge,"Gadmen, Switzerland",This amazing pedestrian suspension bridge in the Swiss Alps would give Indiana Jones nightmares.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trift-bridge,"Stretching over an arm of Lake Triftsee (itself a product of the Trift glacier), hidden among the high Swiss Alps, the Trift Bridge is a thin modern suspension bridge that looks like it could blow over with one stray wind, but is in fact quite safe. Originally built in 2004, the bridge was replaced in 2009. The first bridge was constructed to allow workers from the Trift hydroelectric plant to access a power plant that was built below the glacier to collect and use the run off. A few short years after the original bridge was built, the second, sturdier model was hung across the wide ravine and the site was opened to the public. Currently the bridge spans a vertigo-inducing almost 560 foot gap in the mountains, suspended over 300 feet from the valley floor. Unlike some of its more primitive inspirations, the Trift bridge is made of thick steel cables over which wooden planks have been bolted. Despite the modern construction it still looks like a death trap. While the bridge itself is an impressive site to visit, the journey to span is harrowing in and of itself requiring a cable car trip, which also carries visitors high above the ground.  It's best to buy tickets up the cable car as early as possible during the day, as they can sell out both ways, or just for the ride back down. While it is possible to hike back down without taking the cable car, the journey is an extra two hour hike."

The Swiss location has become such a legendary draw, the caves are lit with eery lights and adorned with safe footpaths to make it safe and appealing for visitors. As a result, these strange and fascinating caverns have become something of a tourist attraction, with tours and guides readily available.  Opened from late March to late October each year.

88,Abbey Library of Saint Gall,"St. Gallen, Switzerland","This is not only one of the oldest collections in Europe, but also possibly the most beautiful.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abbey-library-of-saint-gall-2,"There are beautiful old libraries, and then there is the Abbey Library of Saint Gall, which may not only be one of the oldest surviving libraries in Europe, but certainly one of the most beautiful. According to the Abbey of Saint Gall’s website (Abtei St. Gallen in German), the earliest evidence of a library collection on the site dates back to around 820 CE, in plans that show a library attached to the main church. The Abbey is said to have followed the Rule of St. Benedict, a portion of which prescribes the study of literature, should a library be available, so it is no wonder that the abbey itself would have been built with one. As the abbey grew over the years, so did its library, and soon the site became known for its collection of illuminated manuscripts and writings, as well as a leading center for science and Western culture around the 10th century. In the mid-18th century, the world-renowned collection was moved to a new library space which was lavishly decorated in a Baroque rococo style. Elaborate artworks were installed in the ceiling which was framed by flowing, curved moldings, giving the space a timeless and fantastical aspect. The wooden balconies are shaped into flowering shapes and designs. Oh, and the books from the historic collection are also on display if you can look past their surroundings to pay attention to them. Today the library at St. Gall is still considered nearly unrivaled in its beauty. It also now holds one of the more important collections in the world, covering 12 centuries of non-stop collecting. The collection even includes the first example of an architectural plan on parchment. But take your nose out of that book and revel in one of the most stunning libraries ever.  Before you go, be aware that cameras are not allowed into the library, and photographs of any kind are not allowed (including photos taken on cell phones. You will be asked to put on slippers over your shoes to protect the wooden floor."
89,Lion of Lucerne,"Lucerne, Switzerland",This memorial commemorating fallen Swiss Guards of the French Revolution has been called the saddest stone in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lion-of-lucerne,"Created to remember the hundreds of Swiss Guards who were massacred during the French Revolution, the Lion of Lucerne was emotionally evocative enough to garner the attention of none other than Mark Twain. Carved directly into the wall of a former sandstone quarry in Lucerne, the titular lion statue sees the regal beast dying from a spear wound which is marked by a shield bearing the mark of the French monarchy. The remarkably large monument was etched from the stone in 1820 and measures a remarkable ten meters in length and six meters in height. Above the mournful lion is the inscription, “HELVETIORUM FIDEI AC VIRTUTI,” which is Latin for “To the loyalty and bravery of the Swiss,” and below the lion’s niche is a list of some of the deceased officers’ names. In his 1880 travelogue, A Tramp Abroad, American author and noted satirist Mark Twain described the monument as “the most mournful and moving piece of stone in the world.” The lifeless eyes of the Lion of Lucerne may not be able to cry, but the endless tragedy in its gaze still inspires more than its share of tears."
90,Sphinx Observatory,"Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland","A historic observatory precariously perched at the ""Top of Europe.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sphinx-observatory,"Scientists have long traveled to Earth’s ends to conduct their studies. Mountaintops are a classic example of a harsh environment that serves as an ideal setting for experiments ranging from the physiological to the astronomical. When the Jungfraujoch station in Switzerland’s Bernese Alps opened in 1912, it became the highest railway stop in all of Europe. It also opened the door for eager scientists awaiting easy access to a high altitude site to do their work. The Sphinx Observatory, completed in 1937, is a result of this influx of research. Perched on a shockingly steep precipice at the so-called “Top of Europe,” the observatory is the highest-altitude construction in the entire continent. With multiple laboratories, a weather observation station, astronomical and meteorological domes, and a 76-cm telescope, the Sphinx has served as a headquarters for researchers in fields such as glaciology, medicine, cosmic ray physics, and astronomy. And over the years, the building has adapted to meet scientists’ needs. Today, the observatory is fully outfitted with electricity, water, telephone, internet, and even a machine to produce liquid air. In addition to the science, the observatory also provides visitors with vertigo-inducing, panoramic views of the snowy Alps, green valleys, and the Great Aletsch Glacier. From the metal grating terrace that surrounds the building, one can see over 11,000 feet below, with views stretching as far as Germany and Italy. Even getting to the observatory is a wondrous journey itself. Riding along the historic Jungfrau railway, passengers have a chance to peer through windows built into the mountainside and browse the peculiar Eispalast (Ice Palace), where ice sculptures depicting everything from people to automobiles are carved within a chilly glacier.

Founded in 1954 to coordinate the research efforts of 12 European countries, CERN – short for the European Organization for Nuclear Research – is the world’s largest (and arguably) most expensive physics lab, home to an array of impressive machinery including several particle accelerators. The biggest of these is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a hollow donut 17 miles (27 km) in circumference buried hundreds of feet underground. Using electromagnets, scientists suspend subatomic particles inside the colliders, then spin them around at ever-increasing speeds, sometimes up to 80 percent of the speed of light. They then smash the particles together. Via Einstein’s theory of mass-energy equivalence, the force of the collisions creates new particles, which fling in every direction and are recorded by sensors. By examining the sensor data, CERN scientists can deduce insights into the Big Bang and the makeup of stars, and even discover new particles, such as the Higgs boson in 2013, the existence of which had previously been strictly theoretical. Yet the singular CERN invention that has transformed the planet didn’t involve atom smashing. By the late 1980s, universities and science centers like CERN digitally communicated with each other over vast distances via telecom lines, but using this early Internet was often tedious and crude. In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist at CERN, proposed the HTTP protocol, which when combined with the existing telecom network and hypertext protocol, gave birth to the visual point-and-click system we call the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee is also credited with designing the first web browser. Today, the WWW is regarded as an afterthought at CERN, with only small references to it in their public exhibits. CERN has two exhibitions open to the public, the Globe of Science and Innovation and the Microcosm exhibit. Individual and group tours are also offered Monday through Saturday in English and French, although slots for the individual tours open 15 days beforehand and fill up very, very fast. The individual tours involve a visit to ATLAS, one of the experiments located along the LHC where you can see the scientists at work, and a stop at the decommissioned Synchrocyclotron, CERN’s first accelerator built in 1957.

92,Stoosbahn Funicular,"Schwyz, Switzerland",The steepest classic funicular in the world glides along a dizzying incline.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stoosbahn-funicular,"The world’s steepest classic funicular whisks passengers up and down a mountainside along a jaw-dropping 110 percent incline. From its base, it zooms skyward along the dizzyingly steep gradient, gliding through a blend of open air and tunnels before emerging at a quaint car-free village. The Stoosbahn is a wondrous feat of engineering. Riders can climb inside one of its four barrels, where they’re treated to panoramic views of the surroundings. The futuristic cylinders rotate throughout the ride, slowly turning in a way that resembles the movement of beer barrels lined up one after another. This allows passenger cars to remain horizontal throughout their four-minute journey, even as the funicular tilts on its tracks along the slope. The funicular opened in December, 2017, after 14 years of planning and building to replace its 84-year-old predecessor. It begins in Schwyz and ends in Stoos, a small alpine village perched atop a peak that boasts stunning views of region’s mountains and lakes. As the village is car-free, the funicular is the best way to reach it. Because of the difficult terrain, construction workers faced multiple setbacks before finally bringing the innovative railway to life. Despite the difficult geography, officials still pushed for the funicular; an aerial gondola would be a poor substitute because the route passes through an active shooting range. Thankfully, they realized the prospect of possibly peppering passengers with stray bullets was a terrible idea."
93,The Reichenbach Falls,"Schattenhalb, Switzerland",The alpine falls where Sherlock Holmes apparently met his demise can actually be visited.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-reichenbach-falls-schattenhalb-switzerland,"Whilst there are some waterfalls in the world, such as the Niagara and the Victoria, that draw thousands of tourists each year to marvel at their natural wonder, there is one hidden away in the alps of Switzerland that looms large in the discerning reader’s psyche: the notorious Reichenbach Falls. For it was here that marked the final and deadly confrontation between Sherlock Holmes and his arch nemesis, the Napoleon of Crime, Professor Moriarty. First published in the Strand magazine in 1893, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle decided to kill off his infamous alter ego in a short story called The Final Problem. His opponent was the nefarious Moriarty, a shadowy figure responsible for organizing all the evil, undetected crimes in London. A fight to the death between the two intellectual equals saw them plunge to their doom in the Reichenbach Falls. The story might have been fiction, but the location was very much real. Doyle was visiting Switzerland as a guest of Sir Henry Lunn, who would go on to found one of England’s first major travel agency companies, Lunn Poly. Visiting the haunting beauty of the Reichenbach Falls, Doyle was given the inspiration for the venue in which to kill off his famous detective. In The Final Problem Doyle describes the falls as a “fearful place…a tremendous abyss, from which the spray rolls up like the smoke from a burning house.” By 1893, Doyle had tired of Holmes’ celebrity; he’s quoted as saying, “I have had such an overdose of Holmes that I feel towards him as I do toward pâté de foie gras, of which I once ate too much, so that the name of it gives me a sickly feeling to this day.” Wanting to pursue what he saw as more serious writing, he told his mother, “I must save my mind for better things, even if it means I must bury my pocketbook with him.” But Holmes was to die in glory; vanquishing the wicked Moriarty by sacrificing himself, and sending them both plunging into the chasms of the Falls. But following Holmes’ apparent death, there was large scale public outcry in England. Eventually Doyle relented and restored Sherlock to his adoring fans in the 1902 novel, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Today, intrepid explorers can retrace Sherlock Holmes’ footsteps by taking a funicular railway to the falls high in the Swiss Alps. There, a pathway and bridge lead to a trail where the infamous narrow ledge is still there today. A small plaque marks the spot where,”at this fearful place, Sherlock Holmes vanquished Professor Moriarty on 4th May 1891.”"
94,Hotel Belvédère,"Obergoms VS, Switzerland",A once-thriving hotel in the Swiss Alps couldn't compete with climate change.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hotel-belvedere-2,"Hotel Belvédère, a hotel in the Furka Pass of the Swiss Alps, was once the perfect spot for travelers looking to explore the Rhône Glacier. But as the glacier receded, so did its number of visitors. Since the end of the 19th century, when the Furka Pass road was built, tourists have flocked to the hotel for its panoramic views over the icy landscape. The glacier was once only a 600-foot walk from the hotel and a 300-foot long grotto carved into the glacier allowed guests to journey inside. Sadly, the Rhône Glacier has lost almost a full mile of coverage in the last 100 years or so. The 11,000-year-old glacier has been known to recede as much as 10 centimeters in a day, and consistently loses about 130 feet a year. The grotto, which dates back to as early as 1894, can no longer be securely carved into the dwindling ice. Hotel Belvédère, which once hosted party-goers and adventurers, and even the likes of Pope John XXIII and Sean Connery, has seen better days. As the glacier moves farther away from the pass, fewer people visit. Though the hotel makes a brief appearance in Goldfinger, it is closed indefinitely. Drivers still stop to take pictures of the building and its mountainous backdrop. The building now sits with its doors and windows boarded up, a testament to the passage of time and climate change."
95,Teufelsbrucke,"Andermatt, Switzerland","A breathtaking bridge that crosses a vast gorge over a river's torrents, and has a tale of a devil architect attached.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/teufelsbrucke,"Crossing the Ruess River that cascades through the Schöllenen Gorge was once no easy task, and was often even fatal to those who tried to forge across the torrents. So in 1230 a wooden bridge was constructed, and while that is now long gone and two bridges have been built to take its place, these have all guarded the title of Teufelsbrücke, or Devil’s Bridge. Occult legends aside, crossing that 13th century bridge was likely terrifying on its own as it shook several hundred feet over the water, or got terrifying close to the water when the river was full. The wooden bridge was heavily damaged in the Napoleonic Wars and later replaced in the 1820s, a structure that still stands alongside another more sturdy bridge built in the 1950s. All are rather frightening to drive over for their height in the Swiss mountains. So where does the devil come in? Well, it’s said that in the 13th century the villagers from nearby Andermatt found it to be an impossible task and enlisted the help of the devil. As it goes with getting a devil architect, he demanded the soul of the first to cross. The townspeople sent a scared goat over to outwit him. Enraged, the devil grabbed a massive stone and was about to destroy the bridge when an old woman with a cross stopped him and he dropped it. The stone is actually still around near Göschenen, although it had to be relocated for a rather huge sum of money in 1977 for a new highway. More likely is that a bridge at such height over the raging river is just unsettling in itself, but for good measure someone once added a couple of painted frolicking devils to the tunnel at its opposite side."
96,Abandoned City of Pripyat,"Pripyat, Ukraine",The ghost town left by the worst nuclear disaster of all time is being taken over by nature and urban explorers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-city-of-pripyat,"When one thinks of Chernobyl, a vacation spot is certainly not the first thing to come to mind. However, more than three decades after the terrible reactor meltdown, tours of the contaminated towns surrounding the infamous reactor are gaining in popularity. On April 26, 1986, during a test to see how much power was needed to keep the No. 4 reactor operating in the event of a blackout, the No. 4 reactor of Chernobyl Nuclear Station exploded causing fire, which lead in the following days to huge damage of the building, releasing extremely dangerous amounts of radioactive chemicals into the air, which over time contaminated millions of square miles in dozens of European nations. The IAEA estimates that approximately 30 people were killed by the explosion and related radiation exposure, with several thousand additional deaths due to higher cancer incidence possible over the long term. The town closest to the No. 4 reactor was Pripyat, a city of 49,000 founded in 1970 to house workers from Chernobyl. It had 15 primary schools, a large hospital complex, 25 stores, 10 gyms, along with parks, cinemas, factories, a pool, an amusement park, and other marks of a thriving community. Because of the people who lived there, it was one of the most beautiful and luxurious cities in the Soviet Union. Only about three kilometers from the explosion, the entire city was forced to completely evacuate on April 27 in just three hours. It was possible only because this scenario was part of the building plans of the plant. Over three decades later, this ghost town is a freeze-frame of the Soviet Union in 1986. Communist propaganda still hangs on walls, personal belongings litter the streets and abandoned buildings. The hammer and sickle decorate lampposts, awaiting May Day celebrations that never took place. Toys are strewn about a schoolhouse where they were last dropped by children who are now fully grown. All clocks are frozen at 11:55, the moment the electricity was cut. Despite the common info, the city was never completely abandoned. Military, police, scientists, and other public authorities use the city as a base to clean radiation in the newly created zone of alienation. The famous pool was in service until 1996. There is still electricity in some part of Pripyat, and to this day there is a functional vehicle base in the city, water supply for the plant, and in the former laundry… there are still laundry after 30 years, where the uniforms of plants workers are washed. in the same building triangle radiation danger signs are made. Ironically, the absence of humans has been excellent for wildlife. In 1986 wildlife was not doing well in Chernobyl, outcompeted for resources by pine and dairy farms. After people left the deer and boar populations returned almost immediately, and despite having radiation levels thousands of times higher than normal, they were not showing obvious signs of mutations (though the plants got pretty weird including some actual glowing) and the animal populations grew enormously. After the elk, moose, deer, and boar returned so did their predators the wolves and lynx. Today the animal populations more closely resemble that of a national park than a radioactive containment zone. As it turns out, from the animal’s point of view, a nuclear disaster is preferable to normal human habitation. To tour Pripyat, Chernobyl, and other surrounding villages, one must first obtain a day pass from the government. These passes can be obtained through the touring companies located in Kyiv, about 110 kilometers from the blast site. There are five well-known tour agencies that take visitors to Pripyat. However, due to the lack of repair, the buildings and other structures in the town are becoming increasingly dilapidated. Because of this, many tour companies will not allow visitors into the buildings. Other than the crumbling buildings, safety is not a major concern. It takes between 300 and 500 roentgen per hour of radiation to deliver a lethal dose. Levels on the tour range from 15 to several hundred micro-roentgens per hour. All tours end with screening for radiation levels. Already, after only three decades of abandonment, Pripyat is beginning to be swallowed up by the surrounding forest. Someday soon, it will no doubt be completely overgrown.  1. Hostel Ukraine Kiev Backpackers (http://www.hostelukraine.com/en//kiev/disaster.html) This is the only hostel in Kiev to offer a tour. 2. Hamalia (http://www.hamalia.ua/Incomming/Tour_to_Chernobyl/) This travel agency has been voted Ukraine's best travel agency over the past 5 years, but requires additional time to book a tour because official registration and permission is needed. 3. SoloEast Travel (http://www.tourkiev.com/chernobyl.php) 4. SAM Travel Company (http://www.ukrcam.com/tour/tour_3.html) 5. Lupine Travel (http://www.lupinetravel.co.uk/) This agency allows for an overnight stay in a Chernobyl hotel if requested. Though each tour differs slightly in the itinerary, most run a few hundred dollars per person, with the price going down the more people added in the group. This price also includes a lunch for every tour, and some even cover lodging. As stated before, each agency has a slightly different itinerary, but all the tours will visit roughly the same sites. 1. Chernobyl: The site of the explosion (all tourist must stay at least 200m from the Number 4 nuclear reactor sarcophagus, which was built to contain any further spills of the radioactive debris). There is a visitor center with a model of the reactor however, and questions about the explosion will be answered there. 2. Pripyat is also on the list. Sites to see include the public schools, a hospital, a never opened fairground complete with ferris wheel, and many homes and apartments, all abandoned. However, most tours do not allow people inside buildings due to their unsound structural instability. 3. Up until April 2008, visitors were also taken to the vehicle scrap yard where military machines used during the radioactive clean up were dumped. The Ukraine government has deemed this vehicle cemetery unfit for visitors due to it still lethal dose of radiation. Vehicles included helicopters, trucks, and ambulances. However, some tours take visitors to a safer abandoned shipyard instead. Some tours include trips to other abandoned villages around the area and optional survivor guides upon request. Lunch for all tours is provided by food from outside the contamination zone."
97,Tunnel of Love,"Klevan, Ukraine",This beautiful natural train tunnel is said to grant the wishes of visiting lovebirds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tunnel-of-love,"Just outside the city of Klevan in Ukraine, a nearly two-mile stretch of private railway has turned the surrounding trees into an enchanting natural tunnel. A train transporting wood to the nearby fiberboard factory runs three times daily. Otherwise, the railway tracks through the tree tunnel make for a lovely stroll for couples and singles alike. The romantic setting earned this stretch of track its nickname, the “Tunnel of Love.” It’s also called the Green Mile Tunnel, for the bright leafy branches that arch over the railway. The tunnel is at its lushest during the spring and summer when the trees are at the peak of their leafiness, but the colorful foliage of fall and snow-covered branches of winter make for captivating sights as well. Local legend has it that couples who visit the tunnel will be granted a wish, provided their intentions are sincere."
98,Pripyat Amusement Park,"Pripyat, Ukraine",This attraction was abandoned after the Chernobyl disaster.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pripyat-amusement-park,"The eerily abandoned Pripyat Amusement Park was only open one day: April 27, 1986, as entertainment for those preparing to evacuate the Ukrainian city following the April 26 Chernobyl disaster. Festive decorations still linger near the haunting rides for the planned May 1, 1986 opening that never came. Its looming ferris wheel has become an unsettling icon of the nuclear disaster, and visitors sometimes leave stuffed animals in its cars as a memorial. The park still contains varying levels of radiation, although the concrete areas are mostly safe. The area under the ferris wheel has some of the highest levels of radiation in the amusement park. There is also an abandoned bumper-car ride, with most rides still fully intact."
99,Odessa Catacombs,"Odessa, Ukraine",The largest catacomb system in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/odessa-catacombs,"In Odessa, when someone’s water line suddenly breaks, or a house settles oddly, or a family pet goes missing, it is not uncommon for Ukrainians to curse about “those damn catacombs.” They are not being delusional, for underneath their houses run some 2,500 kilometers of catacombs, carved into the limestone that the city is built upon. (To get a sense of how much tunnel system that really is, it is only 2138 kilometers from Odessa to Paris.) The date of the earliest catacombs in Odessa is difficult to determine (as they were all widened at a later date), but they likely date back to the 1600s, if not farther. However, the catacombs began to truly grow into their astonishing, labyrinthine form in the early 1800s, when the limestone quarried from them was used to build much of the city. Odessa’s catacombs quickly became the preferred hideout of rebels, criminals, and eccentrics. During WWII, although the Soviets had been forced out of the city, they left behind dozens of soviet-organized Ukrainian rebel groups hidden below the city in the expansive catacombs. Hiding in the catacombs for as much as 13 months, literally below the noses and feet of the Nazis above, the rebels waited for a chance to strike or relay information. These men and women would play chess, checkers, cook, and listen to Soviet Radio, generally trying to make a normal life below the surface of the city. They tried to ignore the malnutrition and malaria which afflicted many of them. Many of the partisan groups lived in the catacombs for the entirety of the rest of the war, and on occasion the partisan groups even managed to blow up German facilities. The Fascist Germans and Romanians meanwhile chose random catacomb exits and sealed them, hoping to trap the men below the city forever, and occasionally tossed poison gas canisters into the catacombs hoping to smoke the soviet rebels out. Once the war was over, the catacombs became home to numerous smuggling and criminal groups, who widened and created new tunnel systems of their own. In 1961, the “Search” (Poisk) club was created, headed by Constantine Pronin of the Paleontological Museum of OSU, and became the first official catacomb exploration unit, meant to explore the catacombs and help document the history of the partisan movement. Today there is an entire Ukrainian subculture of catacomb explorers with dozens of semiprofessional groups, often quite competitive, exploring the catacombs. They go on multi-day underground treks, known as expeditions, to document and map the system. Should someone get lost in the catacombs (as happens every couple of years), these groups put aside their differences and mount large search expeditions. They have rescued a number of children who have wandered into the catacombs. In September 1995, in honor of the 200th anniversary of Odessa, the record for the longest underground journey in the catacombs was broken by a 27-hour continuos journey of over 40 kilometers. (Had they walked in a straight line the journey would only have been 9.5 kilometers.) Shortly after this the mapping of a huge unexplored area of the catacombs known as “K-29” was begun. Partisan weapon caches such as rifles and grenades are occasionally still found within the tunnels, and about once every five years a body is found. On rare occasions these bodies are almost perfectly mummified, freeze dried by the cold, dry air of the tunnels. While most of the time the bodies found are from long ago, stumbling across old bones of soldiers and smugglers from more recent accidents has been known to happen. On January 1st, 2005, some Odessa teens decided to spend New Year’s night partying in the catacombs. However, in the drunken revelry a member of the group, a girl named Masha, became separated and lost in the catacombs. She spent three days wandering in the freezing cold and pitch black before she died of dehydration. It took two years before the police were able to locate her body and retrieve it from the catacombs. While going into the catacombs is not illegal, there is only one small portion of the catacombs that is officially open to the public, which can be seen at the “Museum of Partisan Glory” in Nerubayskoye, north of Odessa. It would be extremely dangerous to try and explore the catacombs on one’s own. However, professionals can be hired at the cost of 250 hryvnia per person, depending on the time spent underground, the complexity and length of the route, the number of tourists, and options for delivery to the site entrance to the underground area."

The museum’s slogan is “est dolendi modus, non est timendi,” Latin for “there is a limit of sadness, anxiety has no limits.” Outside the museum stands a tank, an ambulance, a fire jeep, and a military jeep. The entrance is a staircase lined with street signs which name every village affected by the disaster. Chernobyl had a population of 49,346 people living in 11,000 apartments, and as such evacuation was not immediate. The radiation on April 27, 1986, the day of the evacuation, was 400 - 1500 mR/h. This exceeds the acceptable norm 75,000 times. The small museum includes three exhibit halls that seek to inform, remind and issue a stark warning of the reconciliation that is necessary between man, science, and the technology that threatens and endangers the Earth.  An informative centre. A must if visiting Chernobyl."
101,Darth Vader Statue,"Odessa, Ukraine","A monument to Lenin has been transformed into a statue of everyone's favorite black-helmeted, fool-choking Sith Lord.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/darth-vader-statue,"He was supposed to bring balance to the socioeconomic forces of industrialized society, not leave them in darkness! But — just like the prequels, before we even saw them — we all know how that turned out. The USSR eventually collapsed from outside intervention as well as internal opportunists and revisionists wanting to destroy the socialist model through “free Markets” and “Liberalization” and in the two-and-a-half decades since countless Soviet-era monuments have been scrubbed from cities and towns across the former Eastern Bloc. In April 2015, Ukraine formally passed a controversial package of “decommunization” laws requiring, among other things, the removal of communist monuments. However, for one particular Lenin statue in Odessa, a Ukrainian artist had other ideas. Located in an old factory courtyard on the outskirts of the port city, the statue was scheduled for demolition until Alexander Milov — a local artist whose work was featured at Burning Man in 2015 — proposed a different solution: encasing the existing Lenin statue within a new titanium facade, creating the world’s first monument to Darth Vader. The pose of the old statue has proven to be strikingly appropriate for the new subject; Lenin’s long coat has become Darth Vader’s flowing cape, and the former Soviet leader’s clenched fist now holds a lightsaber. This is not Lord Vader’s first foray into Ukrainian politics, as the Sith master put forward by the Internet Party of Ukraine as a candidate for prime minister in 2014 (the statue is not a project of the Internet Party, despite Milov’s past involvement with them). If you are in the vicinity of the statue and sense a powerful presence in the Force on your phone or other wireless device, that’s because a WiFi access point in concealed in the statue’s helmet, providing free internet to followers of the dark side (or whoever).  Odessa’s Darth Vader statue stands in a private courtyard surrounded by office buildings and factories at 28 Stovpova Street, on the outskirts of town. The entrance to the courtyard may be locked, so it’s best to check in with the security guard to the right of the main gate when entering. The guard on duty will likely speak little or no English, but he will definitely understand the name “Darth Vader.”You can also enter the courtyard through the office building to left of the supermarket. Again, mention ""Darth Vader"" to the guard on the reception desk and he will buzz you through. Trolleybus number 3 runs from downtown Odessa, and stops in front of the factory gates."
102,The Most Expensive Galician Restaurant,"Lviv, Ukraine",Get past the gatekeeper's apartment and enter an elaborate hoax of a restaurant with a Masonic feel.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-most-expensive-galician-restaurant,"A magical place if you can find it, and if you can afford it. The Most Expensive Galician Restaurant has astronomical prices, incredible character performances, and white glove service. And if you can’t afford it? Don’t fear; simply ask for a “90 percent discount” when you get the bill and see the price dwindle to something far more affordable. The restaurant, named for the historic Eastern European region of Galicia (not to be confused with the autonomous community in Spain), takes a little more work than most. For starters, you’ll need to bang on an apartment door and convince the fellow blocking the entrance that you’re worthy of entering the restaurant through his kitchen. He’ll try to turn you away, so you’ll need to be persistent. But when you’re able to get in, it’s well worth it for the gigantic, humorous, and elaborate restaurant. Be sure to visit both bathrooms, each featuring a toilet more stunning than the next. There’s plenty of Masonic imagery throughout the restaurant and, despite being in Ukraine, you’ll also notice some American Founding Fathers decorating the walls of the eatery. Depending on the time of day, musicians will be serenading you along with your meal. And what expensive restaurant is complete without a full-sized car inside? Unlike many other themed restaurants, the food (which includes traditional and modern dishes ranging from Lviv cheesecake to dumplings to steak) and the actors make it well worth it. Just be sure that when the bill comes you ask for the discount, otherwise the restaurant’s name will live up to its promise!  The restaurant is on the second floor. The apartment dweller at the entrance may appear confused first and turn you away. It's typically after the second or third attempt that you're allowed in through the apartment and to the restaurant. With the discount, a bill of $143 will come to $14."
103,Golden Gate of Kyiv,"Kyiv, Ukraine",A reconstructed medieval gateway that was the magnificent entrance to the capital city dating back to 1037.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golden-gate-of-kyiv,"In 1982, the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv marked the 1,500-year anniversary of its creation, and as part of the widespread celebrations that took place one of the city’s oldest monuments, the medieval Golden Gate, was restored and rebuilt. This proved a controversial decision as there was no accurate idea of what the original gate looked like, and there were calls to demolish the new structure and display the ruins of the original, which dates all the way back to 1037, during the reign of Yaroslav the Wise. In the 11th century, Kyiv faced the threat of invasion by a nomadic tribe that had stationed itself outside the city limits. Yaroslav managed to defend his city in the fierce battle that followed, but proceeded to increase its protection by building new fortifications around the area. As part of this plan, the Golden Gate or “Zoloti Vorota” was erected, and served as the main ceremonial gateway to the city. The entrance to the huge stone and brick structure was through heavy oak doors, leading to a secure passageway, and was crowned by a viewing platform and a small Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which in turn, was topped by a gilded dome, a possible reason for the gate’s name. It was damaged during the Mongol onslaught of the 13th century, but continued to be used. After it took a few more hits, efforts were made to repair the gateway, but when these failed, it was covered with earth in the 18th century, and this landmark disappeared from the cityscape for nearly half a century. In 1832, excavations were carried out and the crumbling ruins of the once-magnificent entrance were discovered. The walls and sections of the arch that remained were reinforced and protected. The structure that stands today is an amalgam of the original stone and brick remnants and the modern pavilions that were put up around them in the 20th century. A statue of Yaroslav the Wise was later added to the park surrounding the gate."
104,Abandoned Avanhard Stadium of Pripyat,"Pripyat, Ukraine","One of the most poignant ruins of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the local football team's stadium has been quickly reclaimed by nature.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fc-stroitel-pripyat-avanhard-stadium-abandoned,"Walking through the vast Exclusion Zone surrounding the stricken Reactor Number 4 in Chernobyl is a somber experience. Entire villages and towns have gradually begun to disappear and be reclaimed by nature. There are some 90 towns inside the Zone, but the most iconic and well-known is the worker’s city of Pripyat. Opened in 1970, it existed for just 16 years before being abandoned to a nuclear fallout a hundred times more lethal than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Pripyat was a youthful city; nuclear power was at the forefront of modern technology, and the average age of the 50,000 or so who lived in Pripyat was around just 26 years old. The city was built to be one of the most modern in the former Soviet Union, and geared to youth. It had nightclubs, sports centers, swimming pools, bars, and romantic cafes overlooking a lake. It also had a football team, the FC Stroitel Pripyat. Like many soccer teams throughout the USSR, the team was formed out of a group of workers, stroitel meaning “builder” in Russian. They were founded soon after Pripyat was completed, playing in the fifth tier of the Soviet football league pyramid, as well as competing in regional competitions. FC Stroitel, playing in the shadow of the newborn nuclear reactors, in white shirts with blue shorts and red stockings, had their best season in 1985, finishing second and looking good for promotion to the higher reaches of the Soviet league system. Their home ground was called the Avanhard Stadium, capacity 5,000, located a few hundred yards from the now-iconic empty amusement park on Sportyna Street. Walking through this silent city of ruins, past the crumbling apartment blocks, shopping precincts, and abandoned hospitals and schools is a haunting experience. But there is something especially poignant about seeing the places built for leisure and entertainment falling apart. Approaching the old stadium, you pass rusted floodlight towers, some toppled over, and into a perfect rectangle of tall trees, surrounded by a concrete moat. It takes a while to recognize that you are looking at the football pitch, surrounded by a running track. Not many places in Chernobyl show the startling reclamation of nature as much the height of the trees on the football field, which have sprung to over 30 feet in just as many years. On the far side of the old pitch are the remains of the main stand. You can still see the tunnel where the teams would have left the home and away dressing rooms to enter the pitch. Rows of rotting wooden benches line the concrete stand, leading up to the ruins of the covered press box. Midfield Magazine reported how on April 26, 1986, FC Stroitel Pripyat’s opponents for the upcoming weekend’s fixture, the magnificently Soviet named, FC Mashinostroitel, were preparing to leave for Pripyat. The sharp end of the season was approaching, and the two sides were scheduled to play in the semi-final of the Kyiv Regional Cup. A helicopter landed on FC Mashinostroitel’s training field, and a fraught-looking official informed them, “lads, go home, you’re not going to Pripyat tomorrow.” The cataclysmic events unfolding at Chernobyl meant no football team would ever play there again."
105,Priest's Grotto,"Borshchivs'kyi district, Ukraine",A subterranean Holocaust refuge within one of the world's longest cave systems.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/priests-grotto,"Beneath an expanse of wheat fields within the remote farmland of Western Ukraine lies over 127,779 meters of explorable passageways, caves, an underground lake, and the secret to survival for 38 Jews who lived underground through one of history’s darkest eras. Several brave families of Ukrainian Jews lived for nearly a year within the surreal underground world of the Gypsum Giant cave system, the longest uninterrupted cave habitation known. Needing to conserve fuel and candlelight, they lit the cave only long enough to cook, spending almost all of their time in complete darkness. They struggled with sensory deprivation, isolation, the threat of starvation, and constant fear of being discovered for a year before finding a message in a bottle tossed into the cave which read “The Germans have already gone.” When the families emerged one little girl had grown so accustomed to the dark, that she had forgotten what the sun looked like and asked her mother to  “put out the bright candle, because it hurt her eyes too much.” With the end of World War II, their underground ordeal went untold for decades, with the survivors wary of exposing their hiding place for fear that a future need to retreat back into the earth would arise. Much of the massive cave system remained unexplored until the early 1990s, when Christos Nicola and an expedition of professional cavers discovered several artifacts suggesting relatively recent human habitation.  Since then, Nicola spent ten years researching the story and managed to track down remaining survivors, slowly unearthing the incredible stories of their life underground.  It is about 450 kilometers (280 mi) driving distance southwest of Kyiv, and about 5.5 kilometers (3.4 mi) south of the district seat of Borshchiv."
106,Rodina-Mat : Mother Motherland,"Kyiv, Ukraine",340-foot statue built to honour the Heroes of the Soviet Union.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mother-motherland,"Standing proudly over the Kyiv skyline is the 340-foot tall, stainless steel Soviet Mother Motherland statue. Originally intended to be even taller, the sword of the statue was cut because it was higher than the cross of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, a renowned Orthodox Christian Monastery. She ranks 18th on the list of the world’s tallest statues. For a bit of comparison, The Statue of Liberty ranks about 42nd. Held in the statue’s left hand is a shield with the State Emblem of the Soviet Union. For a small fee, you can go up to the height of the shield for a breathtaking view of the Kyiv skyline. Below the towering statue in its base is a Memorial hall that displays the names of 11,600 soldiers and over 200 workers on the home-front, honored during the war with the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. The statue is part of the Museum of the History of Ukraine in World War II (until the law changed in 2015 it was known as the Museum of the Great Patriotic War) and standing on top of the hill she is the piece de la resistance. However, with the entire complex covering 10 hectacres and with over 300,000 exhibits it is the largest museum in Ukraine. Setting aside adequate time is very much advised. The entrance to the complex is typically Soviet; bold, large and imposing with sculptures depicting courageous struggles against German invasion, Nazi occupation and, of course, the devotion of the partisans to the party’s cause. The outdoor complex is complete with a plentiful array of carefully arranged tanks, trucks, aeroplanes, helicopters and other assorted vehicles and weapons, all of which can be enjoyed whilst listening to a gloomy soundtrack of Soviet music. The museum is large, dimly lit and does not shy away from the atrocities that took place in Ukraine. Rodina Mat’s construction (1979-1981) was controversial due to the massive costs that many believed should have been put towards more worthy or better causes. Controversy has not left the steel Mother with many people feeling that she should be torn down and her materials better utalised as she is a symbol of the Soviet State and communism. As recently as 2015 the Ukraine parliament, in an attempt to move away from the days of communist oppression, have outlawed Soviet and communist symbols. World War II monuments are exempt from the legislation and as such, because Rodina Mat and her surroundings are Soviet war memorials, her future looks safe. The museum's content and overall atmosphere is heavy. Save the trip up Rodina Mat until the end so that the views and the fresh air can blow some of the depression away."
107,All Saints Church,"Hodovytsya, Ukraine",The ruins of an abandoned church loom within a picturesque Ukranian village.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/all-saints-church-and-cemetery,"In the Ukranian hamlet of Hodovytsya, cute brick houses line the main road, which links small family farms and miles upon miles of lush green fields. A short walk here will reveal more picturesque gems that hint at the area’s turbulent past. Before World War II, this part of Ukraine was within Poland’s eastern borders, and the community here used to be a mix of Polish and Ukrainian. The Poles were generally Roman Catholic and the Ukrainians mostly Greek Catholic (Eastern-Rite Catholics who practice Orthodox ritual but recognize the authority of the Pope). Given the similarities between the two denominations though, some churches in the region were reportedly attended by both Polish Catholics and Greek Catholic Ukrainians, who would often go to mass together. All of this has changed during the war and then shortly afterward, when national borders were redrawn and people were forcibly displaced from many regions across central Europe. All these messy and tragic relocations left behind traces of the disbanded communities in their former homes, mostly in the form of cemeteries, old houses, monuments, and places of worship. Hodovytsya is no exception. The ruins of the All Saints Catholic stand quietly by the side of a placid lake, making for an impressive sight. The old church is an example of late Baroque architecture and features some heavily damaged frescoes dating back to the 18th century. Sadly, the church was all but destroyed by a fire in the 1970s. The entire roof is gone, but both its interior and exterior are still ornate. There are virtually no Catholics left in the area, so the church has never been restored, but it is open to the public for half an hour each week. While in the village, be sure to check out the graveyard as well. The cemetery here is half-Ukrainian and half-Polish. The Polish part features some beautiful gravestones and sculptures, but it remains largely abandoned since the Polish community left in the 1940s. The cemetery is kept periodically maintained, but as the Polish part is not frequented, most of the graves are overgrown. Someone has recently tied white-and-red ribbons to the Polish graves (the colors of Poland’s national flag), so that they can be more easily identified. There are some beautiful sculptures here, mostly of angels, although many of them have suffered weather damage.  Hodovytsya and the surrounding villages can be reached easily by regular buses from Lviv. Take a bus to Hodovytsya, then walk along the main road towards Basivka. For the All Saints Church, you will need to take a small road on the left (going slightly downhill). As of June 2018, the church was open for visitors on Sundays at 3.00 p.m., for 30 minutes only. For the cemetery, go back to the main road and again follow it in the direction of Basivka. The cemetery will also be on the left. You can then continue to Basivka and take a bus back to Lviv from there."
108,Under the Black Eagle Pharmacy Museum,"Lviv, Ukraine",Ukraine's oldest operating pharmacy now offers guests a fascinating walk through apothecary history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/under-the-black-eagle-pharmacy-museum,"The ceiling of Під Чорним Орлом, or Under the Black Eagle pharmacy, is painted with symbols of air, water, fire, and earth, representing the humors of the body, the preeminent theory of early medicine. Since 1735, Under the Black Eagle has tended to the apothecary needs of Lviv’s citizens, making it the oldest operating pharmacy in Ukraine. But since 1966 it has offered more than just medicine. The front room of the Under the Black Eagle is still a functioning dispensary, and it’s here that the pharmacy museum tour begins. Museum visitors can walk through 16 rooms to different historic eras of medicinal care, going back in time as they retreat further into the building. After paying a small entrance fee to the pharmacist, the pharmacy opens up to a wood-shelved room chock full of antique pharmacy equipment. There are mortars and pestles, various beakers, ornate scales, jars containing tinctures, elixirs, and other medicines, all from the 19th and 20th centuries. The material room contains the equipment for manufacturing medicine in earlier times (pill machines, drying cupboards, extraction presses, recipe manuals, etc.). In a replica brewery the pharmacy still offers its “iron wine,” an ancient iron-boosted beverage said to raise hemoglobin in the blood. An outdoor courtyard with an attached 17th century apartment shows what the yards of Lviv’s upper middle class looked in that time period. The pharmacy also boasts one of the most comprehensive medical libraries in Eastern Europe, with over a thousand ancient medical texts and even more books from the 18th to 20th centuries. In the basement, visitors can see one of the earliest forms of pharmaceutical studies: an alchemist’s laboratory. Oak stairs from the courtyard lead to this secret dungeon, where rare plants that would have been used in this seemingly magical room hang around the walls. This exhibit details the beginnings of medicine throughout Ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. The Rynok (Market Square) is in the heart of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage site. There are several other more traditional museums among the historic buildings on the square."
109,Duga 'Russian Woodpecker' Radar,"Ivankivs'kyi district, Ukraine",This derelict superstructure was a very important warning system for the Soviet military.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/duga-russian-woodpecker-radar,"Duga is an enormous, now-abandoned antenna system built in the 1970s as part of a Soviet anti-ballistic missile early warning network. It is a huge lattice mega-structure with two antennas: the first first 150 meters high and 550 meters long, and the second 80 meters high and 220 meters long. To operate the radar system, a small secret city was built, in which 1,000 people lived. The structure broadcast a sharp tapping sound which earned it the nickname “Russian Woodpecker.” It was such a powerful system that the sounds disrupted legitimate radio broadcasts and communications all over the world. While many people worldwide had theories as to what was causing the noises, the source wasn’t confirmed until after the fall of the Soviet Union. The site at Chernobyl remained in operation after the disaster, but in 1987, most of the technical equipment was moved to a site at Komsomolsk na Amure. Today, the mega-structure is still there, just a few miles south of the infamous Chernobyl reactor. There are plans to install wind turbines on it.  After the death of visitor who fell from the radar, all ladders were cut off, so climbing on the higher antenna is almost impossible."
110,House with Chimaeras,"Kyiv, Ukraine",An Art Nouveau building covered in animal gargoyles and grotesques.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-with-chimaeras,"Created in 1902 by Vladislav Gorodetsky, an avid hunter, the animal-covered building was meant to be his living quarters, but Gorodetsky soon had to vacate the building due to money troubles. It changed many hands over the years, but currently is an official building of the Ukrainian President. When built in the early 20th century, it cost 133,000 rubles, which would be around a million rubles today. While some of the animals ornamenting the structure may be gargoyles, which are animal-like (or in this case, actually animal) waterspouts, meant to get water off already-heavy church roofs, most are grotesques, which are often just as gnarly as gargoyles, but are purely cosmetic."
111,Museum of the Great Patriotic War,"Kyiv, Ukraine","One of the largest museums in Ukraine remembers the story of the German-Soviet War in iconic, brutalist style.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-the-great-patriotic-war,"While the conflict between German and Soviet forces on the Eastern Front during World War II were part of the larger narrative of the war, they also took on a singular identity as a private war unto themselves. The tellingly-named Museum of the Great Patriotic War in Ukraine tells the story of this portion of the war via hundreds of thousands of exhibits and an undeniably Soviet sense of design. One of the Ukraine’s largest museums, commemorating a patriotic perspective of World War II between the Soviet Union and Germany. The museum - containing more than 300,000 exhibits - and related memorials cover approximately 25 acres on a hill overlooking the Dnieper River near the heart of Kyiv. The cool, quiet halls are a somber testament to the gravity of the conflict, with a plethora of armaments (both Russian and German), equipment, artwork, models, and propaganda. A bewildering promenade of sculptures surrounding the museum depict the defense of the Soviet border from the 1941 German invasion, resulting occupation, resistance, and the epic 1943 Battle of the Dnieper and Battle of Kyiv, one of the war’s largest operations involving more than four million combatants. Nearby is the iconic, 62-meter tall Motherland statue, one of the best recognized landmarks of Kyiv. The world is has no shortage of museums devoted to the military actions of the second World War, but rarely has such a collection so singularly told the story of their fighting men."
112,Highgate Cemetery,"London, England",London's creepiest cemetery was once the site of dueling magicians and mobs of stake-carrying vampire hunters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/highgate-cemetery,"Opened in 1839, Highgate is one of London’s most infamous cemeteries, originally opened as one of the city’s “Magnificent Seven” park cemeteries. The initial design was carried by architect Stephen Geary. Among the impressive Victorian and Egyptian influenced tombs are the gravestones of Karl Marx (recognizable by the glowering bearded bust); sci-fi author Douglas Adams; James Holman, a sightless 19th-century adventurer known as “the Blind Traveler” (a pioneer of “human echolocation,” he was able to sense his surroundings by the reverberations of a tapped cane or horse’s hoof-beats); and Adam Worth, a famous criminal and the possible inspiration for Sherlock Holmes’s nemesis, Professor Moriarty. Comprised of Kensal Green, Highgate, West Norwood, Abney Park, Nunhead, Brompton and Tower Hamlets cemeteries, the Magnificent Seven were created in 1832 as part of an effort to move burials out of the City of London in response to the twin pressures of the health concerns about overcrowded churchyard cemeteries, and desires for build-able land in the rapidly expanding city. The cemetery’s tombs and buildings are constructed in an imposing Victorian Gothic style and during the mid- to late 1800s it was a highly sought-after burial ground. However, by the end of WWII the cemetery was overgrown, unattended, and in serious disrepair, all of which added to its creepy feel. In the 1970s the infamous cemetery became the location for another English Gothic tradition, the horror films of movie studio Hammer.  These films regenerated public interest in the cemetery, and stories of grave robbing, desecration, and vampires in Highgate began appearing in the news. As described in the book Beyond the Grave, “Many claimed to see a particular creature hovering over the graves. Scores of ‘vampire hunters’ regularly converged on the graveyard in the dead of night. Tombs were broken open and bodies were mutilated with wooden stakes driven into their chests. These stolen corpses, turning up in strange places, continuously startled local residents. One horrified neighbor to the cemetery discovered a headless body propped behind the steering wheel of his car one morning!” Known as the Highgate Vampire Sensation it culminated in 1970 with two magicians, Farrant and Manchester, claiming that each would be the first to find and kill the supposed vampire. Manchester announced an official vampire hunt, and on Friday the 13th, “a mob of ‘hunters’ from all over London swarmed over gates and walls into the locked cemetery, despite police efforts to control them.” The two magicians were supposed to settle the debate with a “magicians’ duel” but it never happened. Farrant was arrested in the churchyard next to Highgate Cemetery with a crucifix and a wooden stake and in 1974 was jailed “for damaging memorials and interfering with dead remains in Highgate Cemetery.” Though neither magician found the supposed vampire, in the various “hunts” graves were ransacked and real corpses were indeed staked and beheaded. The debate between Farrant and Manchester continues to this day, while the cemetery remains a popular location for occult, paranormal and vampiric enthusiasts.  Both the West Highgate section, which is the most overgrown, and the East Highgate section, including the grave of Karl Marx, can be explored on your own, but you need to pay an entrance fee. There are guided tours available for both sections. You need to book entry tickets ahead of time for the West Highgate section. The cemetery gates are open to visitors daily from 10 a.m. to 4 or 5 p.m. (depending on the season). From Underground stop Archway (not Highgate). On leaving the station, turn left and walk up Highgate Hill (past the Whittington Hospital) until you get to St Joseph's Church (obvious by its large green copper dome). Enter Waterlow Park on your left and go downhill across the park (past the duck ponds) to the Swain's Lane exit (below the tennis courts). The walk takes about 20 minutes. Note: photography is strictly limited in the cemetery. From their website: ""Ticket price includes permission to take photos for personal use only. Video cameras and the use of tripods are not permitted. Photographers are asked to ensure that their photographic activities do not impede the progress of tours."""
113,Leadenhall Market,"London, England",This ornate Victorian marketplace was the setting for Diagon Alley and the Leaky Cauldron in the Harry Potter films.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leadenhall-market,"The ornate 19th-century painted roof and cobbled floors of Leadenhall Market, located in the historic center of London’s financial district, make it a rather magical place to do a bit of shopping—even before it played a starring role in the Harry Potter films. This covered Victorian market is one of the oldest markets in London, selling meat and fish as far back as the 14th century. The current green and red roof, however, was constructed in 1881 and made Leadenhall Market a popular attraction in London. The marketplace was featured a few times in the Harry Potter series—it was the film location for some of the original exterior shots of Diagon Alley, the cobblestoned shopping hub of the wizarding world where Hogwarts students can stock up on school supplies like spellbooks and wands. Today if you wander down the market’s Bull’s Head Passage you may recognize the blue door of an optics shop (an empty storefront at the time of shooting) as the entrance to the Leaky Cauldron in Goblet of Fire. In the films, the magical Diagon Alley is accessible to wizards and witches from London through the Leaky Cauldron, an unassuming pub wedged next to a record store. If only that were true for us Muggles.  The market itself is generally accessible 24/7, however, the shop hours vary and sometimes operates on limited hours."
114,The Ruins of St. Dunstan-in-the-East,"London, England","One of the few remaining casualties of the London Blitz, this destroyed church has become an enchanting public garden.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-ruins-of-st-dunstan-in-the-east-london-england,"The church of St.Dunstan-in-the-East has survived a lot during its 900-year history, including the Great Fire of London in 1666. An English parish church located halfway between the Tower of London and London Bridge, it was originally built during Norman times. Although the Great Fire caused terrible damage to the church it was faithfully rebuilt and topped with a steeple designed by Sir Christopher Wren. But in 1941, the church was devastated by the Blitz. A direct hit destroyed everything apart from the north and south walls, and Wren’s steeple. The threat of German invasion of the United Kingdom had ended with the Battle of Britain a year earlier, but the sustained strategic bombing of the UK continued. By 1941, the Blitz was reaching its terrible crescendo. Starting on September 7, 1940, London was bombed for nearly 60 consecutive nights. The night of December 29 saw the most ferocity, as the Luftwaffe blanketed London with bombs in what was called the Second Great Fire of London. By the end of the Blitz, over 1 million London homes had been destroyed, including much of the old Saxon church. After the war, with much of London in rubble, the slow rebuilding process began. But St. Dunstan-in-the-East remained in ruins. In 1967, the City of London Corporation decided to turn the bombed-out shell of the church into a public garden, which remains to this day. Hidden away on a secluded side street, and long since dwarfed by the modern steel and chrome structures of the city, it remains one of London’s secret gardens. One of the last Blitz-damaged buildings left in the United Kingdom, overgrown with trees, ivy, and wall-climbing flowers growing amongst the ruined arches, it’s a poignant living memorial to the horrors of the Blitz and a testament to the resilience of the City of London which survived it.  Be forewarned, this spot is popular for Instagramers. Get there early and avoid the weekends, if you don't want to compete for photographs."

More recently, the city’s gentrification has brought an influx of young creatives and curious hipsters into the neighborhood. These two faces of Walthamstow come together in the purple haze of God’s Own Junkyard. God’s Own Junkyard is a kaleidoscopic warehouse-maze of handmade neon signs that blazes forth in an old industrial estate like a Vegas mirage. Curated by third-generation neon artisan Marcus Bracey, GOJY serves many functions: free art gallery and Instagram bonanza for the public; dealer and recycler of signage for businesses; prop shop for film and photo shoots; and lucrative customer for the local electric utility. The collection includes thousands of signs, props, and figures, all displayed within a single warehouse space. Cheerful emblems for diners and hotels wink from wall to wall. Every form of disreputable fun is represented in bright light, stacked from the floor and hung from the ceiling: cocktails, karaoke, rock ‘n’ roll, pinball, disco, casinos. Neon-trimmed religious images share space with lurid displays designed for, or inspired by, the retro carnal vice dens of old Soho. As Bracey told The Independent newspaper while describing his creative process, “you stand back and look at it, and that’s what really gives you the kick.”  Only open to the public on weekends (check website for exact hours), but you can make an afternoon or an evening of it: There is a cafe serving snacks, coffee, and adult beverages. Purchases can be made by cash or card, although there is a minimum charge of £5 if paying by card. The industrial estate is also home to a couple of other establishments serving cocktails, craft beers, and food. The location is about a 12-minute walk from Walthamstow Central station on the London Victoria and Overground lines.

116,Fingal's Cave,"Isle of Staffa, Scotland",This astonishingly geometric cave has inspired everyone from Jules Verne to Pink Floyd.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fingal-s-cave,"Queen Victoria, Matthew Barney, Jules Verne, and Pink Floyd are not names you usually hear in the same sentence, but then the place that they all share is itself quite uncommon. Known as Fingal’s Cave, it bears a history and geology unlike any other cave in the world. At 72 feet tall and 270 feet deep, what makes this sea cave so visually astoundingly is the hexagonal columns of basalt, shaped in neat six-sided pillars that make up its interior walls. These fractured columns form a crude walkway just above the water level so that visitors can go far inside and explore the cave. The cave was a well-known wonder of the ancient Irish and Scottish Celtic people and was an important site in the legends. Known to the Celts as Uamh-Binn or “The Cave of Melody,” one Irish legend, in particular, explained the existence of the cave as well as that of the similar Giant’s Causeway in Ireland. As both are made of the same neat basalt columns, the legend holds that they were the end pieces of a bridge built by the Irish giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (a.k.a. Finn McCool), so he could make it to Scotland where he was to fight Benandonner, his gigantic rival. The legend, which connects the two structures, is in effect geologically correct. Both the Giant’s Causeway and Fingal’s Cave were indeed created by the same ancient lava flow, which may have at one time formed a “bridge” between the two sites. Of course, this happened some 60 million years ago, long before people would have been around to see it. Nonetheless, the deductive reasoning of the ancient peoples formed the connection and base of the legend that the two places must be related. The cave was rediscovered when naturalist Sir Joseph Banks visited it in 1772. At the time of Banks’ discovery, Fingal, an Ancient Epic Poem in Six Books was a very popular poetic series, supposedly translated from an ancient Gaelic epic by Irish poet James Macpherson. The book was an influence on Goethe, Napoleon, and Banks, who promptly named the Scottish cave, which already had the name Uamh-Binn, after the Irish legend, calling it “Fingal’s Cave.” And though Banks is responsible for both rediscovering and renaming the cave, it would be a romantic German composer who truly vaulted the cave to world fame. So moved was famed composer Felix Mendelssohn by the splendor of the cave that he sent the opening phrase of an overture on a postcard to his sister with the note: “In order to make you understand how extraordinarily the Hebrides affected me, I send you the following, which came into my head there.” The Hebrides Overture, also known as Fingal’s Cave, premiered on May 14, 1832, in London. (The original name may have been based on the amazing noises the cave sometimes produces.) In a one-two Romantic punch, artist J. M. W. Turner painted “Staffa, Fingal’s Cave” in the same year and together these launched the cave from a little-known wonder into a must-see Romantic-Victorian tourist site. William Wordsworth, John Keats, Lord Tennyson, and Queen Victoria all visited the cave as did consummate traveler and lover of wonders, Jules Verne. After this, the cave never left the public imagination. Pink Floyd named one of their early, unreleased songs after the cave, and Matthew Barney used the cave in his Cremaster cycle. One can visit the cave via cruise (though boats cannot enter the cave, they make regular passes by it) or can travel to the small island of Staffa and hike into the cave by stepping from column to column. By the way, northern shores of Staffa host a puffin colony during the summer months.  To get to nearby Iona the ferry from Fionnphort connects with bus number 496 to Craignure, which connects with a Caledonian Macbrayne ferry service to Oban. Oban has a train and bus service to Glasgow. The journey from Iona to Glasgow takes approximately five hours. The bus and ferries will wait for incoming services to try to keep the connections. Boat trips from Oban, Dervaig, Tobermory, Fionnphort (all on the isle of Mull) and Iona allow visitors to view caves and the puffins that nest on the island between May and September. There are relatively few puffins that nest on Staffa, and they tend to nest on the other side of the island from Fingal's cave. The entire island is walkable via trails. There are tours available that take in Staffa as well as more puffin-heavy islands; they run mostly in June-July, which is high puffin season. There is a landing place used by tourist boats just north of Am Buachaille, but disembarkation is only possible in calm conditions. The island lacks a genuine anchorage. Look for seals on the nearby small islands."
117,Twinings Tea Shop,"London, England","A 300-year-old tea shop that brought tea to the English people, not to mention the Queen herself.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/twinings-tea-shop,"You’ll have to excuse the exoticized Chinamen figures atop the Twinings tea shop doorway at 216 Strand. They’ve been sitting up there for about three centuries, in which time the cultural acceptability of such caricatures has lessened, and tea is more often associated with British gentry than with Chinese merchants. As a young man Thomas Twining apprenticed under an East India Company merchant, importing goods from exotic locales, coffee and tea in particular. Twining’s mercantile career began in 1706 when he opened a small storefront on a busy London thoroughfare called the Strand. He called it Tom’s Coffee House, and it soon became a popular gathering spot for fashionable aristocrats. Despite his shop being dedicated to coffee, Twining soon garnered a reputation for having some of the finest tea blends in London. Within a decade he ceased selling coffee entirely and almost exclusively sold dry packaged teas. This allowed women to partake in tea-drinking at home as well, as coffee houses were male-only establishments. Twining expanded his business, opening up more shops, and eventually growing it into the tea empire it is today. Though we think of Britain’s relationship to tea being as old as the nation itself, the drink had only been introduced in the 1660s by a Portuguese queen. With the expansion of East Indian trade and merchants like Twining though, tea quickly became the national beverage. Today Twinings is synonymous with the history of British tea. Over 300 years later, the original Twinings shop on the Strand is still in business. The Twinings logo, a simple, gold sign bearing the company name, has remained unchanged since 1787, making it the second oldest corporate logo still in use, behind that of Stella Artois, which was first introduced in 1366. In 1837, Queen Victoria granted the company a Royal Warrant, a merit which has given Twinings the honour of providing tea to the Royal family ever since."

It takes its official name from the “pataphysical” Last Tuesday Society Chancellor, Viktor Wynd. The Society “is devoted to exploring and furthering the esoteric, literary and artistic aspects of life in London and beyond”. The gallery shop, situated within a small group of commercial premises along an arterial road, is full of taxidermied specimens of all sizes, skeletons under glass domes, erotica, modern art, books and myriad other curios. Step inside and glimpse everything from polar bears to peacocks, quartz dildos to vintage speculums, winged animals to insect sculptures, skulls of all sizes and origins, anatomical anomalies, and even a couple of mermaids. The shop’s website describes it as “an attempt to recreate or reinterpret, within 21st century sensibilities, a 17th century Wunderkabinett”. Although in need of a good dusting, the Last Tuesday Society’s Shop of Horrors is curious, horrific and fascinating in equal measure. “It is a collection of objects assembled at a whim on the basis of their aesthetic or historical appeal,” the website explains. “There is no attempt at creating or explaining, meta-narratives or educating anyone. It is merely a display of naturalia and artificialia designed to give pleasure to the creators of the Museum, who hope that you too will enjoy it.” The shop’s manager, Vadim Kosmos, says: “Curiosity shops provide a sense of wonder. You can look anything up on the internet these days, but you can’t touch it.” The groundwork is now a dedicated bar selling the usual drinks and cocktails but specializing in absinth served in the traditional manner with fountain, spoon, and sugar   The closest tube station is Cambridge Heath, bus from Old Street. The closest mainline station is London Fields."

Accessible only by a foot hike through the Glen Brittle forest, the series of small waterfalls that make up the so-called Fairy Pools are some of the most pristine swimming holes in the world. On a sunny day, the turquoise waters of the natural pools are so clear, one can readily see each moss-covered stone at the bottom. Located at the foot of the Cuillin Mountains, the crystal-clear water flows between pools with waterfalls of various shapes and sizes. On wet, cloudy days after a good rain, torrents of water rush and whirl in thunderous cascades. There does not seem to be a legend attributed to the fairy pools, but rather the pools look as though they were pulled from the imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien. The waters of the Fairy Pools might be bone-chillingly cold, but their near supernatural atmosphere has made them one of Scotland’s most enduring natural wonders.  From Portree on the Isle of Skye, head North and then West towards the town of Carbost. Just before reaching the town, head South towards Glenbrittle. A small fairy pools sign can be seen at the crossroad. While driving towards Glenbrittle, the Fairy pools car park will be found on your right. Parking costs £5 per car and must be paid for by coins or card (no notes). From the parking lot, called (and signed) Glumagan Na Sithichean, cross the public road to find the path labeled ""Sligaghan,"" take the path in front of you. The return walk takes 2 hours without any places to protect from the sun, wind or rain. Several small river crossings are required (with large rocks to help) and ground can be slippery when wet. Proceed with caution."
120,Puzzlewood,"Coleford, England","The mysterious, fantastical woodland inspiration for ""The Lord of the Rings.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/puzzlewood,"Located inside the Forest of Dean near Coleford, Puzzlewood is a popular outdoor tourist destination in Gloucestershire, England. It’s filled with beautiful moss-covered rocks, bridges, and fantastic rock and tree formations that can be accessed by miles of winding pathways. Puzzlewood, used as a filming location for Merlin and Dr. Who, covers more than 14 acres and is considered one of the best examples of pre-Roman Celtic open iron mines. The paths were laid in the early 19th century by the owner at the time. It didn’t open to the public until 100 years later. An enchanting place, Puzzlewood is said to have served as the inspiration for J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. A frequent visitor to the area, Tolkien may have considered Puzzlewood and the Forest of Dean when he created the Old Forest, Mirkwood, Lothlorien, and other places in his Middle Earth. In addition to the forest, there are farm animals, outdoor picnic tables, a cafe, a gift shop, and a children’s playground in the area. Some of the animals kept in Puzzlewood include cattle, wild fowl, rabbits, donkeys, Soay sheep, goats, and Shetland ponies. The area around Puzzlewood is a working farm. Over the years, evidence of Roman occupation of the area has been found in the form of over 3,000 coins from the third century. Over the hundreds of years since the Romans left the site, the trees and moss have grown unchecked to cover any man-made structures that may have been left behind for mining.  Puzzlewood is less than a mile south of Coleford in the Forest of Dean. The simplest way to get there is to head to Coleford and follow the brown tourist signs for Puzzlewood."
121,Fairy Glen,"Isle of Skye, Scotland",This dramatic landscape hidden on the Isle of Skye looks as though you've stepped into the magical realm.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fairy-glen,"The Fairy Glen is one of the Isle of Skye’s most enchanting attractions. The bumpy, off-the-beaten-path spot stands out from the surrounding farmland. The natural rock formations, cone-shaped hills dotted with ponds and scattered waterfalls, are all within one small area, making it seem as though it’s the shrunken version of a large-scale geological wonder. Though there’s no definitive folklore linking the land to the magical realm, some say faeries created the dramatic landscape and still dwell within its many crevices. It’s no wonder; the whimsical otherworldly landscape looks just like the kind of place you’d expect to find mythical creatures. The Isle of Skye is, after all, rich with faerie lore. However, the unique geological formations are actually the result of a landslip, similar to the one that created the nearby Quiraing. It’s easy to spend a morning or afternoon wandering among the cluster of hills. The grassy glen’s natural colors are especially vivid on a sunny day. Visitors can take their time climbing the mounds or snapping photos of the stone designs tourists tend to create (though they’re not nearly as impressive as the more permanent rock spiral). The best vantage point is from the top of Castle Ewan, the natural rock formation that resembles an ancient ruin. A steep, narrow trail leads directly to the top, but it does involve a bit of scrambling. The locals consider the stone designs created by tourists to be vandalism and spend the winter undoing them each year. Since the glens are on private property, it’s appropriate to respect the wishes of the locals on this matter and refrain from building with the rocks.  Note that there are no signs for the Fairy Glen. If you're heading North on the A87 (coming from Portree), turn right on the road right just before the Uig Hotel. It's about a five minute drive along a narrow, winding path to the glen, which is visible from the road. Park on the grass, but be careful not to block any traffic."
122,Platform 9 3/4,"London, England",Kings Cross Station pays tribute to its role in Britain's best-selling book series.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/platform-9-3-4,"Harry Potter fans know: the best way to get to Hogwarts is aboard the Hogwarts Express, which dutifully awaits students of the prestigious wizarding school at Platform 9 3/4 at the start of each term. Reaching the platform, of course, is an adventure in itself; magical blood and nerves of steel are required in order to pass through what appears to be a solid brick barrier to where the platform is located on the other side. Details of Platform 9 3/4 were made public by the 1997 publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, the debut novel of J. K. Rowling’s phenomenally popular Harry Potter series. Kings Cross station reappeared several times throughout the series, serving as the setting for some of the most pivotal moments, and the station was later used as a shooting location in the Harry Potter films. For several years now, Kings Cross has celebrated its role in the beloved books with a marker indicating the location of Platform 9 3/4, below which a baggage trolly can be seen disappearing into the bewitched barrier. Construction on Kings Cross Station between 2005 and 2012, however, made the magical platform even more elusive than usual, shuffling the marker and accompanying trolly to various locations around the station several times, at one point relegating it to an alcove outside. In 2012 it was announced that the attraction had finally found a permanent home in the New Western Departures Concourse, nestled between Platforms 9 and 10, right where you would expect it. Important to note: for muggles, the barrier remains quite solid, and Potter fans are advised against attempting to cross it. Easily found within King's Cross Station, but allow plenty of time if you wish to wait in line to pose with the magical trolley, or visit the adjacent Harry Potter Shop, especially during the high tourist season."
123,Cecil Court,"London, England",A charming 17th-century alley is lined with secondhand bookstores and antiquarian shops.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cecil-court,"This dreamy little 17th-century lane is a book lover’s paradise. It’s lined with about 20 secondhand bookshops and antiquarian shops, all selling a trove of unique treasures. It’s no wonder the street’s nickname is “Booksellers’ Row.” Cecil Court feels like a hidden gem. Though the narrow street splinters from a highly trafficked thoroughfare, it maintains a calm, cozy atmosphere. The buildings that stand today date from the late 19th century, making a wander down the street feel like a stroll through London’s past. Pop into the Victorian shop fronts, and you’ll be greeted by shelves of (at times pricey) goods. You can find anything from first-edition books to rare children’s literature, from unique maps to esoteric goods and one-of-a-kind jewellery and art. You can also sift through boxes of prints and books outside some of the shops. Cecil Court is one of the Covent Garden neighborhood’s older passageways. As such, it’s as historical as it is aesthetically alluring. An eight-year-old Mozart stayed here for a year while he was touring Europe. A century later, the street became a hotspot for early British filmmakers; and it was the inspiration for “Diagon Alley” in the Harry Potter films.  You can stroll down the street at any time, though most of the shops don't open until around 10. Once you've explored all Cecil Court has to offer, pop over to nearby Goodwin's Court to glimpse another charming alley."
124,Goodwin's Court,"London, England",An easily overlooked stretch of ornate window fronts and gaslight lamps that could be right from the pages of Dickens.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/goodwins-court,"London is famous as a city of side streets and alleyways and conjures up pictures of deerstalker-clad detectives appearing from the fog, pacing behind top-hat adorned gents or serial killers. Goodwin’s Court is an excellent example of just that sort of evocative image, tucked neatly away between London’s modern, bustling boulevards. An easily missed set of steps from St. Martin’s Lane leads through a low-roofed arch and around a corner to reveal what seems to be a perfectly preserved piece of London nostalgia: a spindly stretch of ornate window fronts and gaslight lamps, akin to anything found in the pages of Charles Dickens or Conan Doyle. According to the nearby plaque, the well-preserved row of shops was built in 1690, predated by a passage known as Fishers Alley. Actress and mistress to Charles II, Nell Gwynn, is thought to have been one of the earliest residents of the Court. It’s easy to imagine elaborate window displays, which were at the time gaining in popularity, decorating the elegant windows and catching the eyes of shoppers strolling by. When the shops slowly became increasingly unprofitable, the quaint alley was occupied by offices, and many theater and entertainment agents have taken spaces there at different points in time. Today, the doors are decorated with gleaming door knobs, knockers, and nameplates for the businesses contained within. The charming passageway now maintains a relatively secluded feel from the surrounding busy streets, serving as a scenic shortcut. Goodwin’s Court draws its fair share of local photographers and domestic TV stations in search of a unique city location. Whether viewed through the spectacles of Dickens or just straight out of the history books, it’s an excellent example of the architecture and historic charm that helps London continue to capture the imagination.  Goodwin's Court is easy walking distance from Trafalgar Square and the Charing Cross Tube Station."
125,Magic Circle Museum,"London, England",This collection of illusory paraphernalia has been culled from the history of London's premier magician's club.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/magic-circle-museum,"Established back in 1905, Britain’s Magic Circle is a secretive group of illusionists who have set out to keep the magic in magic. While the illusionists are not inclined to reveal their secrets, curious conjurors can take a peek at the mysterious collection kept in their headquarters’ museum. Opened in 1998, the clubhouse of the Magic Circle was built from the ground up as a base of operations for the century-old illusionists club. In addition to a mid-sized theater where regular shows can be put on or simply prepared for, and a library of books pertaining to the art of illusion, there is a remarkable museum of posters, artifacts, and ephemera from throughout the history of magic. Among the items on display are a number of props from guns used in bullet illusions, to pieces of Houdini’s famous act, to the cup-and-ball trick that Prince Charles used when he applied to join The Circle (he was accepted in 1975). Entrance to the Magic Circle headquarters is restricted to members of the close-knit magician’s cabal, although they do host a number of public events where mere muggles can enter the building for presentations, shows, or simply to see the museum. Anyone that does not want to wait for them to pull back the veil can apply to join the Magic Circle, although it requires two years as an apprentice, and being sponsored by at least two preexisting members just to be able to test in. Making it through that process itself is no small trick."
126,Mary King's Close,"Edinburgh, Scotland",17th century streets hidden under Edinburgh were once a breeding ground for the black death.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mary-kings-close,"Life in 17th-century Mary King’s Close in Edinburgh was less than sanitary. Inhabitants lived in narrow winding streets, crammed into packed tenements up to seven stories high. Without a proper sewer system, tenants simply dumped waste into the streets below. Rats ran wild in the close carrying fleas with them everywhere they went. When the fleas became infected with the bacterium Yersinia pestis, better known as the bubonic plague or “The Black Death,” it spelled disaster for the residents of Mary King’s Close. When the Black Death first appeared on the British Isles, it appeared to be a problem only in the English territories. The Scots delighted in calling it “the foul death of the English.” Soon, however, the rats, fleas, and bacteria had made their way to Scotland. The country lost a quarter of its population to the scourge. In the tight quarters of Mary King’s Close, the disease was particularly devastating. There is a persistent myth that in an effort to quarantine the victims, Edinburgh city officials sealed off Mary King’s Close in 1644, leaving some 600 inhabitants to perish inside without hope. In reality, the plague victims were well cared for, and the town council managed the outbreak efficiently and compassionately. Families healthy enough to be moved were taken to Burgh Muir. Those who weren’t able to be moved let the workers know by putting up white flags in their windows so that food and coal could be delivered to their doorsteps. The plague doctor, George Rae, then came into the town wearing leather from head to toe and a bizarre bird-shaped mask to help protect him from the disease. (It worked; the leather kept the fleas from biting Rae and he survived the outbreak.) To save a plague victim, Rae would slice off the top of the victim’s sore and jam a red-hot poker into the wound to cauterize it. While no doubt horrible, the technique did indeed save lives. After the plague had passed, tenants continued to live in Mary King’s Close up until the beginning of 20th century, when it was emptied and sealed up. The last person to leave, did so in 1902. The Royal Exchange was built on top of it and the close was forgotten. It wasn’t rediscovered until workmen digging on the street above accidentally punched down into the winding streets. The closes were used as bomb shelters during WW II. Beginning in the 1990’s, Mary King’s Close has become a popular tourist site, with guided tours by historical reenactors, and attracts those interested in its macabre history and many ghost stories. One of the most famous ghosts supposed to live here is a 10-year-old girl named Annie who died of the plague. Believers report temperature changes and feeling a strange presence in her room. Many have left toys, dolls, and sweets for her in the close. Tours are given seven days a week, all year long (excluding Christmas Day) with special events throughout the year, including a look into what Christmas would be like in the close’s prime.  Directions for how to get to the close for different types of transportation can be found on the official website. The walking tour is just over an hour, it will cover very uneven surfaces in near darkness, including several sets of stairs, steep grades, low ceilings and doorways. Wear suitable footwear. The tour is not wheelchair accessible and may not be suitable for those with limited mobility or problems with confined spaces. Children under 5 are not permitted."
127,The Churchill War Rooms,"London, England",The perfectly preserved underground rooms where Churchill plotted the war against Germany.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-churchill-war-rooms-london-england,"Hidden deep underneath the streets of Westminster lies what was once one of the most secretive and protected parts of London. As the German Luftwaffe pulverized Britain during the Blitz, a system of bunkers and tunnels protected the British government, as Sir Winston Churchill and his chiefs of staff, desperately plotted to secure Britain’s defense against the impending Nazi invasion. The Churchill War Rooms remain remarkably preserved. After the last V2 rocket hit London, and victory in Europe was secured, the government returned to its daily duties above ground in the Houses of Parliament and the War Rooms were simply sealed up and forgotten. They remained so until 1984 when custody was handed over to the Imperial War Museum and the bunkers were opened to the public. Today, the hidden complex looks just as it did in 1945, as though Winston Churchill had just left the room, and was about to return. Plans for some form of protective bunker where the government could operate in safety were drawn up, as far back as 1938. The Spanish Civil War had shown what horrors modern aerial bombardment could inflict. As Germany ramped up its military industrial might, the Committee of Imperial Defense began digging underneath the basement of the New Public Offices, located on the corner of Horse Guards Road and Great George Street. A complex system of bunkers, sleeping rooms, communication equipment and ventilation was burrowed underneath Westminster, and the War Rooms were completed on August 27th, 1939. Just five days later, Germany invaded Poland. The main brief of the war rooms was to provide the Cabinet with safety whilst they worked. It was also to become the nerve centre of the British war effort, as a meeting place for the Chiefs of Staff for the Army, Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force. Today, entrance is gained by a small doorway by the Treasury building, under steps marked with a statue of Clive of India. The corridors are narrow, and dimly lit just as they were during the dark days of the Blitz. As wave after wave of German bombers firebombed London with high explosives and incendiaries, the War Rooms aimed to maintain order and calm. One of main corridors still has its weather board in place, where a card strip would indicate whether the day would be sunny, rainy, or cloudy. During air raids, the indicator was always changed to “windy” as a joke. Original plans during the 1930s had mooted the idea of having the Prime Minister and his Cabinet evacuate the City and operate from the country, but it was felt that Londoners would feel abandoned. So the Cabinet would meet daily here underground. The Cabinet Room is left as it was, with Churchill’s chair at the head of the table. The War Cabinet would meet here during air raids, a total of 115 times. But the danger was still deadly. Despite the re-enforced concrete, it is estimated that a direct hit by a bomb of anything over 500 pounds would have completely destroyed the deep lying bunker. Of equal importance as the Map Room. Here a daily intelligence report of the enemies strength’s and movements were plotted on giant maps. Manned 24 hours a day, the maps also showed the depositions of the British armed forces. Heads of all the armed divisions relied on the up-to-the minute military intelligence depicted on the maps, providing crucial information for King George VI and Winston Churchill. Depicted on the maps by strings of blue wool and pins, the German advance was steadily plotted. By 1940, the foreboding line of blue wool had reached the English Channel itself. As the Battle of Britain raged overhead, the tension within these hidden rooms must have been on a knife edge. Joan Bright, of the War Office and stationed in the War Rooms described how they had “been shut up inside the fortress of Britain. Blacked out, bombed out, conditioned to austerity.” An idea of the firestorm that fell upon London is given by daily reports of the V1 rocket attacks pinned to the wall of the map room. From June 15th, 1944, to July 20th, the intelligence staff plotted 3,955 of the feared “doodlebugs” launched. Of these, 2,955 crossed the coastline into England. One of the most important rooms in the bunkers was also its smallest. A former broom cupboard housed a telephone that was in turn connected to a vast scrambling device housed in the basement of nearby Selfridges department shop on Oxford Street. Developed in America by Bell, it was the cutting edge of communications technology. For it was in this tiny broom cupboard that Winston Churchill was able to talk directly, and safely, to Roosevelt. The scrambler, codenamed “Sigsaly” opened a vitally important direct hotline between the two leaders without the fear of being tapped by the Abwehr, the German intelligence service. A visit to the Churchill War Rooms is to step back to a time to when the future of Britain, and indeed the free world, hung desperately in the balance. Immaculately preserved by the Imperial War Museum, the underground headquarters look just as they did when the lights were finally turned off in 1945."
128,Vatican Necropolis,Vatican City,Hidden beneath the famous St. Peter's Basilica is a veritable city of the dead that may hold the remains of St. Peter himself.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vatican-necropolis,"St. Peter’s Basilica is an astounding and massive wonder, filled with sculpture, art, frescoes, woodworking, reliquaries, and more.  But not many people know that five stories beneath this architectural marvel lie ruins that date back to the founding of the Roman Empire. If you stand near the altar at St. Peter’s (it’s the one with the enormous and incredible Bernini baldacchino under the central dome), you’ll be looking at a point that is stacked upon 2,000 years of history, represented by the preserved artifacts of six different historical periods. Upon entrance to the Scavi, or Vatican Necropolis, you are led down three levels to a 1st century AD Pagan burial ground with some small clay and stone repositories, above which is a 5th century Pagan and Christian combined burial ground with several medium-sized stone mausolea and some other ruins, which include a fractured piece of a large triumphal arch.  Roughly speaking, these two levels and the periods during which they would have been used account for nearly 90% of the span of the Roman Empire (27 BC – 476 AD). Between these levels and the next is a small earthen mound with a hole dug out of it, which is lit and lightly cordoned off, and contains what are said to be the bones of St. Peter himself, as well as the rock on which the original church was first built, in accordance with the edict found in Matthew 16:18-19 , “Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam…“  Two levels above this spot, this text is inscribed in a ring around the dome above in gold and blue frescoes, in letters roughly 20 feet tall, and the dome’s central point is directly above. The next level is a 12th century early Christian church, in the ceiling of which are actually grates up into the floor of the basilica, and the Papal grotto is within this labyrinth as well.  Visiting the necropolis can only be done through an advanced reservation. Requests must be made in writing and groups are limited to 12 people, all of which must be 15 years of age or over. The excavation site can be quite hot even in winter as it is humidity-controlled to preserve the structures. Keep this in mind when choosing what to wear for the day, as you’ll likely want to dress in layers but will still need to comply with the dress code for visiting a holy site (shoulders covered, women in pants or skirts below the knee.) The entrance is very difficult to find, walk around the outside of St  Peter’s square. You’re looking for the Swiss Guard up the border path on the outside of The Vatican on the left side if you’re facing the Basilica steps, not the Swiss Guard posted at the Arco del Campane. You’ll need to have your papers printed and in hand to get through the security checkpoint."
129,Gallery of Maps - Galleria delle Carte Geografiche,Vatican City,Breathtaking and huge 430 year old maps of Italy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gallery-of-maps-galleria-delle-carte-geografiche,"Predating a unified Italy by nearly 300 years, the gallery of maps at the Vatican shows the length and breadth of the peninsula circa 1580. Pope Gregory XIII commissioned the maps from his cosmographer, the multi-talented Italian priest Ignazio Danti. Danti had come to Rome from his post as mathematics professor in Bologna to help the pope with his efforts to correct the inaccurate Julian Calendar using modern Renaissance mathematics and astronomy. At the time, cartography was undergoing its own renaissance. The age of exploration had brought new knowledge of distant lands, and technical innovations like the magnetic compass, sextant, and telescope improved accuracy. By the late 1500s the famous mapmakers Mercator and Ortelius were creating their landmark world maps. More significantly, before Danti took up his post in Bologna, he had spent a decade creating the magnificent hall of maps known as the Sala delle Carte Geografiche at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence at the behest of Cosimo I de Medici, duke of Florence. Maps were not new at the Vatican. Huge maps of the known world capped by a ceiling of stars were painted in the early 1500s in the Loggia della Cosmografia under the guidance of Pope Julius II (primarily remembered for commissioning Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel). To top that, Gregory set his sights on the 120 meter long corridor on the third floor of the Belvedere Courtyard. The ambitious project to install 40 enormous and highly accurate maps began in 1580 and took just 18 months to complete. Details of the large frescoes show the Siege of Malta, the Battle of Lepanto and large-scale maps of the maritime republics of Venice and Genoa. One map shows the Battle of Fornovo, the first battle in the Italian Wars against France. Each regional map is accompanied by a detailed view of its major city. The ceiling frescoes illustrate stories from the lands depicted below. Danti is also credited with the brass orrery that sits in the hall. The gallery was restored and enhanced under Pope Urban VIII a century after it was created. Most visitors today pass through the gallery on their way to the Sistine Chapel as part of the Vatican Museums."
130,La Resurrezione,Vatican City,If you want to talk to the Pope you will have to stare down this surreal vision of Jesus rising from a nuclear hell.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-resurrezione,"Looming over the main stage of the Paul VI Audience Hall in Vatican City, La Resurrezione by sculptor Pericle Fazzini depicts a thoroughly modern resurrection scene that dwarfs the sitting Pope as he receives his general audience. Installed in 1977, the massive sculptural piece shows a rapturous Jesus figure held aloft on plumes of twisted metal brambles. Made of a bronze-copper alloy, the gigantic piece of religious misery stands over 20 feet tall and over 60 feet long, weighing in at a whopping eight tons. While the imposing display is fairly abstract, it is said to specifically depict Christ rising from a nuclear crater, invoking the 20th century fear of the bomb. The thick fumes of toxic smoke portrayed in the piece almost seem to writhe beneath the over-sized Son of God. This evocative piece is located in the audience hall used by the Pope to deliver his less popular general audiences and oratories. These smaller (by comparison) events offer a chance to get a bit more up close and personal with the Pope, but one must still confront the beauty and (the horror) of La Resurrezione."
131,Stufetta del Bibbiena,Vatican City,The Vatican's secret porn-festooned bathroom was painted in erotic murals by one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stufetta-del-bibbiena,"A tiny bathing chamber in the Vatican’s Papal Apartments was painted in 1516 by Raphael for one Cardinal Bibbiena, a good friend of the pope and apparently, a fan of the erotic decorative arts. Bibbiena, known in his pre-Cardinal life as Bernardo Dovizi, was a writer, lover of the arts, and something of a libertine. When he moved into the Vatican, he sought out Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino, better known as the artist Raphael. Generally known for more sanctified images, Raphael produced some of the most magnificent religious paintings and portraits of the Renaissance. But apparently, he was willing to do a little side work. Located within the private papal apartments, the murals imitate many of the frescos uncovered in classical era Roman building throughout the empire, featuring frolicsome nymphs and satyrs. The pope at the time of the painting was Pope Leo X, formerly known as Giovanni di Lorenzo de’ Medici, and a close friend of the Cardinal. The Medici pope was known for his support of the arts, and indeed sponsored other Vatican works by Raphael and other notable Renaissance artists. Purportedly, upon his being named as Pope, he commented to his brother, “Since God has given us the Papacy, let us enjoy it.” Stufetta della Bibbiena means, roughly, Bibbiena’s warm room, and once served as a bathroom. Over the years the erotic wall coverings have been ignored, covered, and the room converted for different uses. The images are more playful nudes and suggestive mythological beasts than raunch, but there are some titillating exceptions. There is an image that depicts Pan, the goat god of nature, moving away from some bushes somewhat aroused. This was decided to be a little too offensive for the church and efforts were made to censor it, however this only made it appear larger and more noticeable. In 2011, writer Tony Perrottet wrote about his coup: he successfully finagled himself into the normally off limits room, and personally explored the tiny room. He described the details of the panels: “Raphael had designed his frescoed panels like a graphic novel, recounting the adventures of Venus, the goddess of love, and Cupid, the god of erotic desire, for Cardinal Bibbiena to admire as he lounged in his hot tub. At knee level, the original silver faucet was crafted into the face of a leering satyr. One panel showed the naked goddess stepping daintily into her foam-fringed shell. In others, she admires herself in a mirror, lounges between Adonis’ legs and swims in sensual abandon. A couple of the frames, even more risqué, have been destroyed. One, recorded by an early visitor, showed Vulcan attempting to rape Minerva.” Raphael painted a portrait of the cardinal the same year. It now hangs at Palazzo Pitti in Florence."
132,Vatican Mosaic Studio,Vatican City,A hidden workshop for creating and restoring Papal mosaic masterpieces.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vatican-mosaic-studio,"Back in the late 16th century, Pope Gregory XIII became pretty much obsessed with mosaics. He brought Venetian mosaic artists to Vatican City specifically to teach their trade to Roman craftsmen, who soon set about decorating parts of St. Peter’s Basilica, including the Gregorian Chapel and the Dome of Michelangelo. Such was the success of this new artistic initiative that mosaics spread to other cupolas in the Basilica, becoming an integral part of this masterpiece of Renaissance architecture. It wasn’t until 1727, however, that the Studio del Mosaico Vaticano (Vatican Mosaic Studio) was formally established. The studio is tucked away in a comparatively unassuming building in Vatican City. Here, a handful of highly talented artists and craftsmen have worked tirelessly over the years to restore the 10,ooo square meters of mosaics in Saint Peter’s Basilica, while at the same time creating original mosaic masterpieces. These artists were also pioneers of the filate enamels technique, which allowed them to create minuscule mosaic tiles that comprise the incredibly detailed works in the Basilica, which to the untrained eye often look more like paintings than mosaics. But the work of the studio certainly doesn’t begin and end with the Basilica. It also produces mosaic pieces by commission, of varying sizes and normally inspired by religious works, which are sold throughout the world. The Pope, and many Pontiffs before him, also requests original works from the studio. These are traditionally given as gifts to visiting heads of state. Over the last two centuries, recipients have ranged from the King of France Charles X to U.S. President Bill Clinton, the latter receiving a mosaic landscape.  The area in which the Vatican Mosaic Studio is located is off-limits to the general public, so you’ll need to visit with an official tour guide. There’s a shop on site, but don’t expect to pick up any bargain mosaics to send home; these things don’t come cheap."
133,'The Vision of Constantine',Vatican City,This equestrian statue of Constantine the Great has been the subject of criticism for centuries.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-vision-of-constantine,"In 312, shortly before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, Constantine I—known as the first Roman ruler to convert to Christian faith—prayed along with his army. While doing so, it’s said a cross miraculously appeared in the sky with the inscription In Hoc Signo Vinces, or “By this sign you shall conquer.” With this divine encouragement, the emperor went into battle and successfully defeated Maxentius. Over a millennium later, in 1654, Italian artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini was commissioned by the Vatican City to create an equestrian sculpture. Initially, it was designed to be placed in the interior of St Peter’s Basilica, but much to Bernini’s chagrin, Pope Alexander VII decided that it should be constructed at the foot of the Scala Regia, the stairway that connects the basilica to the Vatican Palace. This caused a big problem for the sculptor, as the marble block he had chosen was too small to fit the niche, making the statue seem dwarfed and out of proportion. In the end, Bernini sculpted an extensive marble drape behind Constantine the Great to make up for the space. It was finally completed in 1670 after the Scala Regia was restored by Bernini himself from 1663 to 1666. The statue is purposely placed so that the sunlight that pours into the basilica gives the sense of a God-sent vision. Despite Bernini’s effort and work, the sculpture was met with a volley of criticisms immediately after its unveiling. Contemporary writers pointed out various “problems”, while others complained that the cross was not viewable to most people and that the statue lacked realism. Even today, “The Vision of Constantine” continues to be a subject of criticism, albeit for different reasons. To most visitors to the Vatican, it’s only visible from a single viewpoint under the basilica’s portico. This inaccessibility has caused the statue to receive little attention in art history, and still remains relatively obscure an attraction."
134,Vatican City Walls,Vatican City,"Historic fortifications form the boundary of Vatican City, but it’s not entirely surrounded by walls.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vatican-city-walls,"Medieval and Renaissance walls form the boundary of Vatican City, but do not enclose it entirely. For the millions of tourists who visit the independent city-state each year, an occasional metal detector is the only thing that might slow them down. Historically speaking, surrounding a town or city with walls was rarely a bad idea. Pirates, raiders, and rival states were just a few threats to a settlement, making fortifications a wise investment of time and money. Vatican City was no exception. The first major fortification of Vatican City was completed in 852. Following an attack by Saracen raiders in 846, Pope Leo IV ordered the construction of a wall around the Leonine City, an area that covered the current Vatican territory and the Borgo district of Rome. The 39-foot-tall Leonine Wall, as it became known, stretched for a little under two miles as it encircled Vatican Hill. It was the first time the area had been completely enclosed. Once the Muslim threat had passed, many of the city gates were opened. Paul III and Pius IV later expanded and modified the fortifications in the 16th century, partly as a statement of political power but also to protect against political violence in Rome. Further modifications were made up until the end of the reign of Pope Urban VIII in the 1640s. These historic walls still exist along most of the boundary of Vatican City today. But the 110-acre city-state is far from being an impenetrable fortress. Anyone can stroll into St. Peter’s Square, where a white line painted on the ground is the only boundary. And of the six entrances into Vatican City, three are open to the public. Some parts of Vatican City are off-limits. But everywhere else is easily accessible, the only barriers to a quick entrance being the queues and an occasional metal detector. Even the Vatican Library, famous for its secret archives and Dan Brown-escapades, is easy enough to enter if you have a Vatican library card. As Ken Pennington, a professor of medieval history at the Catholic University of America, told The New York Times: “When I am there I show the guards my library card and they let me right in. It’s the only place in the world where a library card gets you into a country.”  Vatican City is an independent city-state enclaved within Rome. Visitors do not need a visa or even a passport to enter, but some visitors might be asked for identification, so it’s a good idea to take your passport, national ID card, or driver’s license."
135,Domus Sanctae Marthae,Vatican City,These spartan apartments are provided to clergymen visiting Vatican City.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/domus-sanctae-marthae,"While many visitors to Vatican City simply look for affordable lodging while in Rome, the Domus Sanctae Marthae is the accommodation of choice for the College of Cardinals and other Catholic holy men. Otherwise known as the Casa Santa Marta, the five-story building lies on the edge of Vatican City. Built in 1996 by Pope John Paul II to make papal visits easier on the aging clergymen who had been staying at lodgings farther afield, the 131 rooms are the temporary home for clergy when they are in the Vatican on official Holy See business, providing comfortable but not overly proud accommodations. However, when the College of Cardinals are summoned to elect a new pope, the guesthouse clears for the cardinals. The windows are then shuttered and locks are placed throughout in order to ensure privacy. Pope Francis made the building his home when he was elected to his station."
136,Shajarat-al-Hayat (Tree of Life),Bahrain,This centuries-old tree tells an unusual tale of vegetation and fertility in the desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tree-of-life,"Impossibly squeezing the moisture from grains of sand, one tree in Bahrain has found a way to thrive in the desert. The Sharajat-al-Hayat or Tree of Life has stood alone in a brutally harsh climate for over 400 years in a remote desert location. Lacking any visible source of water, the 32-foot mesquite tree has baffled visitors and scientists alike for its entire life as it has continued to grow. Although the mesquite tree is known for holding a great deal of water in its massive root system, there is still no source of water in sight. Even arid vegetation needs water to survive, which makes Bahrain’s Tree of Life even more mysterious. Without a rational explanation for the tree’s biological success, many have turned to mythology and religion for answers. Some assert that Enki, an ancient god of water in Babylonian and Sumerian mythology, protects the tree. Others still believe the site is the historical location of the Garden of Eden. Whatever the answer, the tree has shown no sign of dying, and continues to inspire as it stands proudly in the tiny desert nation. Only a mile from the tree is the hazy Jebel Dukhan, the highest point in Bahrain. From 440 feet above sea level, the hill allows for a true appreciation of the barren landscape in which this tree has thrived."
137,Arad Fort,"Arad, Bahrain","This beautifully historic Bahrain fortress might not be the most popular attraction around, but that might make it all the better.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arad-fort,"A 15th century Islamic fort stands well preserved off the coast of Bahrain, a testament to its sturdy construction (and reconstruction). A short five minute drive from the sleek modernity of Bahrain’s International Airport sits one of the oldest archaeological sites on the island. Arad Fort is not as large or as celebrated as its nearby sibling the Bahrain Fort, but it is this reason that Arad is worth a trip, as a visitor will often find themselves the only person there inside the fort, allowing one to absorb the history uninterrupted. Built in the 15th century using traditional Islamic building techniques (palm trees, the abundance of coral limestone found on the beaches), Arad Fort was constructed on a strategically important waterway linking the small island with the rest of Bahrain, and to aid in keeping invading marauders out. Bahrain was at one time the seat of power and trading in the ancient Arabian Gulf, the heart of what was then known as the Dilmun, or Telmun civilization, linking Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley together through trade. But following the rise of Islam, the island was fought over and controlled by a number of different civilizations. Fort Arad was built by the Bedouin dynasty known as the Jabrids to help fortify the island after they took control in the mid-1400’s. Alas, the fortress did not live up to its purpose as the Portuguese handily invaded and seized Bahrain in 1521, killing the Jabrid’s ruler in the process, and controlling the much coveted island for nearly a century until they were defeated by Persia. Over the next few centuries Arad Fort became an area of much fighting in Bahrain, usually whenever the island was attacked by marauders or changed hands through use of force. It was not until 1820, that the Al Khalifa family were installed as the royal monarchy by Britain, and still make up much of the current government of modern day Bahrain. In 1980 the fort was restored with the same materials used during its original construction. There are really no restrictions on where you can go or what you can touch, making the fort a fun place to hop around and a great interactive experience, especially for a family with energetic little minions. Comfortable shoes are a must if one wants to climb about on the ramparts. Located in Muharraq, just South of Bahrain International Airport"
138,Bahrain World Trade Center,"Manama, Bahrain",Skyscraper powered by wind turbines attached between its towers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bahrain-world-trade-center,"The Bahrain World Trade Center is the first commercial development to have large-scale wind turbines as part of its structure. Reducing the need for fossil fuels, the turbines power between 11 and 15% of the building’s power. The environmentally designed twin skyscrapers are each 240-meters tall and curved to funnel the strong Gulf winds into the turbines. By utilizing renewable and efficient energy, the BWTC reduces carbon emissions on the island state."
139,Barbar Temple,"Barbar, Bahrain","This archaeological site boasts temple ruins that date back 5,000 years to the Dilmun culture, an may have been described in the tale of Gilgamesh's search for immortality.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/barbar-temple,"Despite the historical significance of this site, it has very few visitors, and is secured by a single guard who is very happy to tell you all he knows of the site. The Barbar Temple is actually three Dilmun temples, built on top of each other, starting in the third millennium B.C. (For context, the Egyptian Pyramids at Giza started construction in the middle of the second millennium B.C.). Temple 2 was built approximately 500 years after Temple 1, and Temple 3 was built in approximately 2100-2000 B.C. From a central terrace, a stairway leads to a shrine for water cult ceremonies; the spring of sweet water filled the pool at least through the 1950s, as you can see in photos in the small museum on site. This spring was likely a reason for the location of the shrine. Originally uncovered and excavated by Danish archaeologists Glob, Andersen, and Mortensen in the 1950s, most of the finds—which include a copper bull’s head, tools, weapons, and pottery—are on display in the Bahrain National Museum. Approximately four millenia ago, a poem written in cuneiform on a clay tablet in ancient Sumer described Dilmun: The Land of Dilmun is holy, / The Land of Dilmun is pure. / In Dilmun no cry the raven utters, nor does the bird of ill-omen foretell calamity. / The lion kills not, / Nor does the ravening wolf snatch away the defenseless lamb. / Unknown is the wild dog who tears the kid. / The dove does not conceal its head. / No one here says “my eyes are sick.” No one here says “my head is sick.” No one here says “I am an old woman.” No one here says “I am an old man.” The maiden walks here in innocence. No lustrations need to be poured. / The somber death priest walks not here. By Dilmun’s walls he has no cause for lamentations. Could the basis of this Sumerian poem be why Gilgamesh, hero of the earliest surviving notable literature in human history, possibly actually ruling the Sumerian city of Uruk sometime between 2900-2350, traveled to Dilmun to seek immortality? As Bahrain is only approximately 15 miles by 30 miles, the majority of Dilmun ruins are in the northern governorate, and the capital of the Dilmun civilization was likely housed at the Qala’a Bahrain (Bahrain Fort) nearby to the temple. If Gilgamesh did travel to Dilmun, he probably walked the same ground you will at this temple site.  Note that Google Maps and Waze will send you past the parking lot and you may have to turn around."
