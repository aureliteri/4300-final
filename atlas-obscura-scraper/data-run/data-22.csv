0,Funafuti Airport Airstrip,"Vaiaku, Tuvalu","With only one flight in and out a week, the unfenced runway at this small island's airport transforms into a seaside park for locals and visitors.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/funafuti-airport-unfenced-airstrip-park,"Despite its white sand beaches and lively coral reefs, Tuvalu is the least visited country in the world. That’s not particularly surprising when you consider there is only a single, weekly flight to and from the remote island every Tuesday. The other six days of the week, the runway at Funafuti International Airport transforms into a public park. The unfenced airstrip is a place for locals to lounge about and enjoy the island sun, typically in the early evening when the day’s temperatures have cooled. Touch football, soccer, and volleyball games are often underway, and residents will ride around the smooth tarmac on motorbikes. The tranquility is only interrupted once a week when a siren blares warning residents to clear the runway for an approaching flight. There used to be another weekly flight to and from the island on Thursdays, but that flight has since been suspended, likely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The U.S. Navy built the Funafuti Airport in 1943 during World War II. In November 1943, the airfield became the headquarters for a U.S. bomber unit fighting Japanese forces. By the summer of 1944, the U.S. had already begun withdrawing from the island as the fighting moved north, closer to Japan. By 1945, the U.S. Army had fully withdrawn from the island. Soon after the war, the military airfield was repurposed into a commercial airport. In October 1982, Tuvalu welcomed Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. They were the first royals to visit the island, arriving only five years after Tuvalu became a fully independent sovereign state within the Commonwealth.  There are very limited flights in and out of Tuvalu. Be sure to do your research before traveling here."
1,Tuvalu Women’s Handicraft Centre,"Vaiaku, Tuvalu",Ancient weaving techniques are used to create these colorful souvenirs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tuvalu-womens-handicraft-centre,"Right next to Tuvalu’s tiny airport is a small shop known as the Tuvalu Women’s Handicraft Centre. Lined with colorful handmade baskets, fans, necklaces, mats, fishhooks, and woodcarvings, the shop showcases the work of female artisans from the island nation. The shop is only open two days a week when flights land on the Funafuti Airport Airstrip. It is Tuvalu’s only souvenir shop. In Polynesia, it’s often the women who learn and pass down traditional techniques used to create such handicrafts. Polynesian woven goods populate almost every aspect of life on the islands and have been used to make sails, roofing, mattresses, and, of course, clothing. Today the same techniques are used to create everything from baskets to mats. Coconut palms, or kere, are used to make dancing costumes whereas butterfly pandanus, ie’ie, is used in basket weaving. Hibiscus plants, pūrau, are used more widely than either and are used to make everything from ropes, mats, sandals, and dancing skirts. Usually, weavers use the entirety of the plant—stems, veins, bark, leaves, and all—soaking the raw material, macerating it, and then soaking it again. Afterward, the plant material is smoothed, beaten, and dried to get the light tan color used in many of the woven crafts. Natural dyes are also sometimes used to create colorful patterns in the finished weavings. Sometimes whole leaves are sewn into skirts as well, mixing woven patterns with raw plant material. Traditional woven dance costumes often demonstrate as much artistry and skill as Tuvaluan dances themselves. Dance skirts, known as titi, combine many materials. Today finished costumes combine natural materials like leaves and seeds with imported cloth and beads. Sometimes elaborate geometric designs are sewn onto pandanus leaves covered in white cloth which are then attached to the skirts. The colors used in the costumes sometimes serve to demonstrate the status of the dancer or if they’re a part of a certain village, school or church. Titi are usually worn over a fabric dress and are accessorized with wristbands, a headband, and armbands. These costumes are worn during traditional Tuvaluan dances like the Fatele Nukulaelae.  There are very limited flights in and out of Tuvalu. Be sure to do your research before traveling here. The Tuvalu Womens' Handicraft Centre is only open on days when flights go in and out of the tiny airport. The building is adjacent to the small airport building."
2,Underwater Post Office,Vanuatu,"The fully functional, submerged Vanuatu Post Office is definitely one of a kind.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/underwater-post-office,"Say you’re scuba diving, enjoying the natural wonders of a coral reef, and all of a sudden you realize you forgot to send an important piece of mail. Never fear; Vanuatu Post has you covered. One of the world’s only underwater post offices can be found off of Mele, Vanuatu, which hosts the Hideaway Island resort, a vacation spot specializing in scuba and snorkeling. It’s a fully functional post office, which means it also comes with the irritations of a regular post office. It’s only open during certain hours, which are signaled by a flag raised above a float over the post office. You may arrive to find it closed, in which case you must take your mail back with you—no dropping it off. Fortunately, though, you most likely won’t have to wait in line. And of course, because water would ruin any traditional postcards, scuba divers must purchase waterproof postcards and stamps and have them embossed on land rather than writing in ink. It all begs the question, why not just mail your letters from a post office on land? But that’s not in the spirit of adventure."
3,Mount Yasur,Vanuatu,This South Pacific volcano has been blowing its stack for over 800 years and is said to be home to a cult leader waiting to be reborn.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mount-yasur,"Dominating the silhouette of Tanna Island in the South Pacific is a mighty vulcan mountain of Yasur that, despite having spat fire into the heavens continuously for over 800 years, is surprisingly welcome to sightseers and visitors. Daring travelers hoping to see a little action while in the Republic of Vanuatu would be hard-pressed to find a more active locale than Yasur Mountain. The volcano is a continuous hotspot of magma activity, spitting molten rock into the air above its caldera continuously for centuries. Unlike many active volcanoes, the summit of Yasur is approachable on foot by anyone daring enough to try, becoming a major attraction on the tiny island. The mountain has become sacred to many of the locals who subscribe to the cargo cult based around the enigmatic man-god John Frum. The figure of John Frum is shrouded in mystery, some saying he is a white American serviceman, while others have described him as a black man in a local dress. No matter his true form, to those who believe that he will lead them into a brighter future, he is a god. According to some, John Frum actually lives inside of Yasur Mountain, simply waiting to be reborn. While it is unlikely that an enigmatic miracle man is living in a state of flaming un-death deep inside the volcano, the fires of Yasur Mountain are nonetheless awe-inspiring.

4,Million Dollar Point,"Luganville, Vanuatu","The U.S. military dumped millions dollars worth of goods off a beach in Vanuatu, purely to spite the British and French.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/million-dollar-point,"When the United States military abandoned the Vanuatuan island of Espiritu Santo after occupying it as a base during World War II, it left behind infrastructure works such as roads, buildings and runways. But its oddest legacy might be the millions of dollars of goods it dumped into the ocean—just so the French and British couldn’t have them. Today, off the shore of what’s been dubbed “Million Dollar Point” in the Pacific Ocean, snorkelers and scuba divers encounter a surprising sight: a fortune’s worth of military tanks, guns and jeeps resting beneath the waves. Espiritu Santo, an island in the Vanuatu archipelago, was established as a military supply base, naval harbor and airfield after the attack on Pearl Harbor, when the U.S. used it as the launch site for its attack on the Japanese in the Pacific. At the time, parts of Vanuatu were still under British and French colonization. When America left the military base after the war, the remaining goods—everything from weaponry to bottles of Coca-Cola—were offered to the French and British at a very low price, 6 cents to the dollar. However, the colonizers were going on the assumption that should they refuse to buy the items, the U.S. military would be forced to simply leave them behind for free. The Americans were having none of this. To spite the British and French, the military made the rash decision to drive all of the vehicles, food, clothing, drinks, and other equipment to a wharf on the southern coast of the island. The army then drove all of the vehicles into the sea, used bulldozers to dump the rest of the supplies over the wharf, before also driving the bulldozers into the sea, ensuring that the European countries would not be able to get their hands on the items at all, free or otherwise. Millions of dollars worth of goods were completely destroyed over the period of those two days, rendered unusable at the bottom of the ocean. As a result of the dumping, the waters were contaminated with fuel, rubber, metal and other waste, leaving the local Vanuatuans shocked at the carnage, though they salvaged what they could once the Americans had finally departed. Today, you can make your way to Million Dollar Point and take a snorkel or scuba dive through the wreckage, should you desire to swim through this odd memorial to political spite. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about Million Dollar Point."
5,Ambrym Island,"Malampa Province, Vanuatu",Plains of ash and pair of semi-active volcanoes contribute to the otherworldly beauty of this little-known Vanuatu island.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ambrym-island,"If you ask around about volcanoes in Vanuatu you will inevitably be steered towards Tanna Island and the expensive package deals that every tour shop in town sells. They’ll promise you a night at a resort and an easy 20-minute walk up the side of a volcano to see the fireworks. But those who prefer the road less travelled might find their way to Ambrym Island, where the challenging hike through the tropical forest takes 4 to 6 hours, accommodation is in tents or huts built by local villagers, and the food is whatever your guide catches on the way up to the camp site. The centre of Ambrym is dotted with a pair of volcanoes, Maroum and Benbo, but it is less popular than Tanna because they don’t produce such a flashy display. Maroum volcano is a roaring cauldron which produces “Pele’s Hair,” fine strands of volcanic glass which coat the ground around the crater. They are said to occasionally form fragile glass “hairballs” that, in the right wind, can be seen blowing up from the crater. Maroum is also reputed to the site of animal sacrifices – dropping a white chicken into the crater helps escape bad luck. Benbow is a more hazardous journey, and the crater must be entered via a rope to see the lava. The ash plains that lie between Maroum and Benbow are stunning in their own right, but can only be crossed with a guide. Black ash, tinted orange with sulphur from the volcanoes, they become on an eerie sight when wisps of smoke and cloud float through. Different parts of the island have different stories about how the series of volcanoes came to be. One story is that a group were visiting family on the other side of the island, and crossing over left some laplap cooking under coals in the centre of the island. On their return through the forest the laplap had been consumed by the earth, and a volcano erupted the next day. Visiting Ambrym requires more cultural respect than the usual tourist expedition. Visitors must book in advance and can only visit the volcanoes with a local guide. Guides are enthusiastic about sharing stories about their history and their way of life, but they are new to tourism, and there’s a sense that too much attention could upset a delicate balance between maintaining cultural ties and becoming yet another commercialized tourist trap. You can catch a flight to the island from Port Vila, Vanuatu."
6,Amelbati Cannibal Site,"Walarano, Vanuatu",Nestled in the jungles of Vanuatu are the remains of what was once a cannibal oven.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amelbati-cannibal-site,"Surrounded by coconut palms and cacao trees, today these lush grounds in the tiny South Pacific nation of Vanuatu (which is made up of 83 small islands) are eerily quiet. But once upon a time, they were the religious grounds of the Amelbati tribe, which practiced cannibalism. The Vanuatu islands first had contact with Europeans in 1606, but Malekula was isolated and little visited by Europeans until well into the 20th century. As a result, the island’s Indigenous traditions were better preserved there than elsewhere in Vanuatu. This site of former cannibal ceremonies is a 30-minute uphill trek from Walarano village on Malekula. Called a nasara, this sacred ground is also where the Amelbati tribe buried their chiefs. The Amelbati are a subset of the Small Nambas clan. A namba is a woven penis sheath traditionally worn by adult males in Vanuatu. The size of the leaf used in the sheaths differentiates Malekula’s population into two distinct groups comprised of many tribes: the Big Nambas and the Small Nambas. The nasara formed the epicenter of the community. Here the tribe performed all their important ceremonies and rituals. The nasara is roughly broken into four “rooms:” the ceremonial performance space, the courtroom where judges determined captives’ fates, the kitchen where human flesh was cooked, and the cemetery of past chiefs, which includes their memorial stones, skulls, bones, and conch shell trumpets. The site was abandoned when the population moved to the nearby islands of Rano and Wala. According to one Vanuatu man, the process of making human flesh edible was time tested and precise: First, our ancestors would dig a hole in the ground like this. They’d put hot stones in the hole, then cut up the person into pieces and put those on top. They’d add in some yams and taro, put in some more hot rocks, and cover it all over with banana leaves to keep the steam in. Standard baking time for the underground oven was three to five hours. And the chief of the village always got to eat the victim’s head. We’d kill and eat people who stole our women or came to fight us, but we don’t do that anymore. We feel very sorry for those people now. The last reported cannibalism on Malekula Island took place in 1969. Today, the people who live in this isolated paradise are decidedly friendly and hospitable to tourists."
7,Pentecost Island Land Dive,"Penama Province, Vanuatu",The world’s most primitive form of bungee jumping.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pentecost-island-land-dive,"Each spring, just after the first yams begin to emerge from the soil, the men of the South Pacific island of Pentecost erect enormous wooden towers, some as tall as seventy-five feet, in each of the island’s villages. The ceremony is known as N’gol, or land diving. The men climb to the top of these towers, attach two long elastic vines to their ankles, announce to the world their most intimate (and occasionally last) thoughts and then leap. The vines are supposed to catch the jumper just at the point where his hair is able to brush the ground, ritually fertilizing it for a bountiful yam harvest."
8,El Ateneo Grand Splendid,"Buenos Aires, Argentina","This historic, palatial theater is now one of the world’s most beautiful bookstores.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-ateneo-grand-splendid,"With each incarnation since its inception in 1919—first as a performing arts theater, then as a cinema, and now a bookstore—the Grand Splendid has proven itself befitting of its majestic title. Having retained its original frescoed ceilings, ornate theater boxes, elegant rounded balconies, detailed trimmings, and plush red stage curtains, the interior of the building remains as stunning today as when it was first envisioned by architects Peró and Torres Armengol. In its glory days, the Teatro Grand Splendid hosted such tango legends as Carlos Gardel, Francisco Canaro, Roberto Firpo, and Ignacio Corsini. Building proprietor Max Glucksman was a leading figure in the world of tango in his own right, as owner of the influential Nacional-Odeon record label. In 1929, the theater underwent its first transformation to become a cinema, with the distinction of being the first in Buenos Aires to show sound film. Glucksman’s love of tango carried over to the new cinema, with live tango orchestration accompanying the silent films projections. Architect Fernando Manzone oversaw the building’s most recent conversion into the El Ateneo bookstore and music shop, to the tune of AR $3 million. Just prior to the leasing of the building to Grupo Ilhsa in 2000, the Grand Splendid was under threat of demolition due to a poor economy. Though some lament the loss of a beloved cinema, it is now thanks to the Grupo Ilhsa—which owns 40 bookshops, including the flagship Grand Splendid location—that visitors can still revel in this wondrous monument of a bygone era. While the selection of books on offer is standard chain store fare and mostly in Spanish, bibliophiles will find the staggeringly opulent display of books to be reason enough to pay El Ateneo Grand Splendid a visit. To fully bask in the splendor, one can also indulge in coffee and live piano music on the very stage where the Argentinean stars of tango once performed."
9,Perito Moreno Glacier,"Los Glaciares National Park, Argentina",This stunning mass of ice spans 121 square miles and is still growing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/perito-moreno-glacier,"If you only visit one glacier in your life, Perito Moreno would be a good one to pick. It towers above the turquoise glacial water of Patagonia’s Los Glaciares National Park, beaming a blinding white and exuding cold blue hues. Unlike most of earth’s other glaciers, Perito Moreno is still growing. The Perito Moreno Glacier, named for a 19th-century explorer, is currently 19 miles long and rises an average height of 240 feet above the water. Altogether, the glacier covers about 121 square miles. It is part of an ice field located in both Argentina and Chile that is the third largest reserve of fresh water in the world. Part of an area known as Argentina’s Austral Andes, it became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1981. There are viewing platforms a safe distance from the glacier, overlooking Lake Argentino, the glacier’s terminus. You can get pretty close—to the point that you can basically feeling the glacier breathing cold air on your face. If you wait for a while, you’ll likely witness huge chunks of the ice mass fracture off and crash into the water, creating a massive, reverberating roar. There are walking paths that allow you to check out the glacier from a few different vantage points, as well as a boat that takes you on a 45-minute trip around the base. There are also trekking tours that take you out to walk on parts of the glacier itself, surrounded by the beautiful Patagonian scenery of forests and mountains. The Perito-Moreno glacier retreats during the Argentine summer, that is, from December to March (although it may begin to melt earlier), and begins to freeze after the third month.  If you're arriving via your own car, you'll need to take Provincial Route No. 15 from El Calafate, which is 80km (50 miles) and will take about an hour and a half. There are also four bus companies based in El Calafate running daily round trips for about 15 USD."
10,Iguazu Falls,"Foz do Iguaçu, Argentina",A series of waterfalls so massive they straddle the border of Argentina and Brazil.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iguazu-falls,"Flowing for the most part through Brazil, the Iguazu river breaks into upper and lower portions right on the divide between Brazil and Argentina. Depending on the water level of the river, there are between 150 and 300 separate waterfalls at the site pouring water over off a drop of 200 to 300 feet. Despite the hundreds of smaller falls that appear and disappear over the cliffs, over half of the river’s output flows through a channel known simply as the Devil’s Throat. The border between the two countries runs right down the Devil’s Throat separating, the lion’s share of the falls into the Argentinian side and the rest still pouring out of Brazil. There is a scenic overlook that is accessible from the two countries which attracts tourists from both. The Iguazu Falls may divide the river, but they also seem to bring two countries together. On the Argentinean side, you can only pay with cash and in Argentinean pesos. A two night trip is recommended to visit both the sides and rest a bit in the city. But you can visit the park in one night or even one day (only the Argentinean side). Best months to visit: March - May and August - October."
11,La Cueva de las Manos (Cave of Hands),Argentina,"Stenciled handprints and wall paintings dating back 10,000 years, some of the earliest forms of cave art.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-cueva-de-las-manos-cave-of-hands,"Las Cueva de las Manos is tucked in the valley of the Pinturas River, in an isolated spot of the Argentine Patagonia, accessible via long gravel dirt roads. The trip can be rough, but is undoubtably worth it: It leads you to some of the earliest known forms of human art, dating back roughly 10,000 years. The prehistoric artwork painted on the walls of this desert cave is not only ancient, but beautiful. There are three distinct styles to be seen, believed to have been created by different peoples at different time periods. But the highlight is what gives La Cueva de las Manos, or “Cave of Hands,” its name: the hundreds of colorful handprints stencilled along the cave’s walls. The hand paintings are dated to around 5,000 BC. It’s believed these cave dwellers stencilled their own hands using bone-made pipes to create the silhouettes. Most of the prints are of left hands, indicating that they probably held the spraying pipe in their right hands. The artists used different mineral pigments to make different colors—iron oxides for red and purple, kaolin for white, natrojarosite for yellow, and manganese oxide for black. There are also hunting scenes and representations of animals and human life found in the cave, dating back even further than the stencilled hands, to around 7300 BC. The hunter-gatherers who lived in the caves at this time created art depicting the pursuit of prey, the most common of which was the guanaco, a type of llama. A favorite hunting tool was the bola, where interconnected cords with weights on either end were thrown to trap the legs of the animal. A third category of art was discovered, too, with paintings depicting animals and humans in a more stylized and minimalist fashion, done largely in red pigments. Through all these varied forms of cave art, studied layer by layer, we get a peek into the lives of those who lived in the caves, thought to have last been inhabited by the ancestors of the Tehuelche people of the Patagonian desert. It was first explored by researchers in 1949, and more extensive studies were conducted in the 1960s. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1999.  The cave lies in the valley of the Pinturas River, in an isolated spot in the Patagonian landscape. It is most easily reached by a gravel road (RP 41), which leaves Ruta 40 1.8 miles north of Bajo Caracoles and runs 28 miles northeast to the south side of the Pinturas Canyon. The north side of the canyon can also be reached by rough, but shorter, roads from Ruta 40. A 1.8 mile path connects the two sides of the canyon, but there is no road link. The main cave measures 79 ft in depth, with an entrance 49 ft wide, and it is initially 33 ft high. The ground inside the cave has an upward slope; inside the cave the height is reduced to no more than 7 ft."
12,Xul Solar Museum,"Buenos Aires, Argentina","Xul Solar was an artist of alternate worlds, inventor of languages, and dreamer of utopias.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/xul-solar-museum,"With dreams of reforming and perfecting the universe, Argentine artist Xul Solar invented two languages, a spiritual form of chess, a modified piano, and painted works based on his own blend of cosmic mysticism. The Museo Xul Solar in Buenos Aires holds most of his art, along with documents, letters, and the “heirlooms of the cosmos” that he built. The galleries are located just below Solar’s former apartment, where his rooms are preserved along with his library of around 3,500 books. Born in Argentina in 1887 as Oscar Agustín Alejandro Schulz Solari, he later changed his name to Xul Solar, or “solar light.” His paintings of mystic worlds and alternate universes are filled with floating cities, arcane symbols, angels, winged horses, pyramids, snakes, and frightening half-breeds of airplanes and people. His vision of a utopia focused on the creation of a universal language. Believing Spanish to be several centuries out of date, marred by words that were too long and too cacophonous, he invented Neo-Criollo. It was derived from Spanish and Portuguese, with bits of French, English, Greek, and Sanskrit, and meant to be a universal language for South America. Solar tried to speak it with everyone and wrote several texts in Neo-Criollo, including “San Signos,” a collection of 64 writings based on the hexagrams of the “I Ching.” Later, he invented the more complicated Pan-Lengua, an international language rooted in math, music, astrology, and visual art. It was monosyllabic, without grammar, and had an invented script and duodecimal number system In modifying a piano to make it simpler to learn, he built three rows of colored keys for playing a hexatonic scale of his own invention. The colors of the keys corresponded to the colors in his paintings, using the canvas as sheet music. Solar’s efforts at merging spiritualism with art included starting a puppet theatre for adults that presented religious and poetic works, with the characters representing the 12 astrological signs. He dreamed of a self-sufficient city in outer space that would be a “celestial Jerusalem” and believed that flying cities could solve the world’s overpopulation problem. Xul Solar also invented and modified games to fit his new rules for the universe. With soccer, he asked: “Why play with only one ball, and not with three or four, and divide the field into six or twelve parallel sectors, like in rugby, and each player wear a shirt with different letters so that words and phrases are formed?” Pan Chess, his spiritual and complex version of chess, was played on a 13x13 board instead of 8x8 and had constantly changing rules based in the Pan-Lengua language. The rules could at once be a collection of music notes, a dictionary for the creation of new languages, and a way to ask “What are we playing?” When he died in 1963, he was clutching a rosary he’d made himself out of 71 pieces of painted wood. His wife Lita said that he “did not believe in death, for him there would always be a tomorrow.”"
13,Cementerio de la Recoleta,"Buenos Aires, Argentina","Buenos Aires' city of the dead contains some very famous remains, including Eva Perón.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/recoleta-cemetery,"Recoleta Cemetery, in the upscale Recoleta Barrio of Buenos Aires, is the final resting place of many of Argentina’s wealthiest and most famous families and personages. The mausoleums are fairly small, befitting the size of the cemetery in an urban setting, and it’s common for many members, generations even, of the same family occupy one mausoleum. The layout of the cemetery was designed by the French engineer Próspero Catelin, and was remodeled in 1881, while Torcuato de Alvear was mayor of the city, by the Italian architect Juan Antonio Buschiazzo. The cemetery includes graves of some of the most influential and important Argentinians, including several presidents, scientists, and wealthy characters. Internationally, Eva Perón is the best-known person buried in this cemetery. There’s also the tomb of Rufina Cambacérès who was buried alive. The entrance to the cemetery is through neo-classical gates with tall Greek columns. The cemetery contains many elaborate marble mausoleums, decorated with statues, in a wide variety of architectural styles. The entire cemetery is laid out in sections like city blocks, with wide tree-lined main walkways branching into sidewalks filled with mausoleums. While many of the mausoleums are in fine shape and well-maintained, others have fallen into disrepair. Many can be found with broken glass and littered with rubbish, the coffins exposed. The cemetery has become a haven for stray cats, who sleep amongst the graves and mausoleums. Each mausoleum has the family name etched into the facade; brass or bronze plaques are added to the front for particular family members. La Recoleta is one of those cemeteries where the tradition of engraving a death date but no birth date has been maintained.  Its really easy to find it, first go on in the Las Heras avenue, until you find Junin, so in Junin you continue 2 blocks until you find Vicente Lopez street, and you will see a really big wall."
14,La Manzana de las Luces,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",A gateway to a mysterious network of underground tunnels.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/manzana-de-las-luces,"The Manzana de las Luces, or “Block of the Lights,” housed the activities of the early Jesuit missionaries in the nascent Buenos Aires, and as a complex comprises the church of San Ignacio, a cloister residence, a large arcaded patio, and colonial-era administrative building. Although once housing Argentina’s first national library, college, and even the country’s legislature, Manzana de las Luces’s notoriety derives in part from its function as a central point in Buenos Aires’ mysterious subterranean tunnel system. The tunnels likely date from as early as the late 17th century, and given the paucity of any records or mention of the tunnels’ construction, remain shrouded in mystery. The first documented report of an uncovered tunnel came in 1865, and interest in the tunnel network reappeared during a project to drain the neighborhood of San Telmo, when engineers discovered more tunnels. The tunnels range in size, and some lead to large, vaulted chambers. Many have caved in, and the city government demolished many more to make way for the “A” line of the Buenos Aires subway system in the early 20th century. Opinions as to the tunnels’ functions range widely, since the history of their construction remains the stuff of urban legend, and speculation ranges from a defensive or escape network for troops or clergy, to secret chambers for inquisition-style torture, to a clandestine system for smuggling contraband. Daniel Schávelzon, author of The Tunnels of Buenos Aires and the head of the Center for Urban Archaeology, says the tunnels likely indicate an incomplete project initiated by the Jesuits to connect the city’s churches underground. Although chambers and tunnels exist directly under and around religious, government, or military buildings, many of these smaller networks do not ultimately connect. Many tunnels remain undiscovered, however, and may remain secret, perhaps still serving some mysterious function, unknown to the oblivious Argentinians who walk above them. It’s believed these tunnels were the inspiration for those featured in the famous chapter “Report on the Blind”  in the novel On Heroes and Tombs, widely considered to be the literary magnum opus of the writer Ernesto Sabato. Peru Street, between Adolfo Alsina and Mariano Moreno. Two blocks from the Plaza de Mayo"
15,Caminito,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",A bright little alley in La Boca is a part of tango history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/caminito,"“Desde que se fue triste vivo yo, caminito, amigo, yo también me voy,” sang Carlos Gardel, the tango toast of Argentina. With these mournful words he made a tiny stretch of buildings in La Boca, Buenos Aires famous. The line in the song roughly translates to “Since she left I’ve lived in sadness; the alley, my friend. Now I’m also leaving” and the alley in question is Caminito, a colorful little path in Buenos Aires’ La Boca neighborhood. Well, sort of. Curiously, the lyrics to the tango Caminito come from a poem, written by poet Gabino Coria Penaloza, and are in reference to a different alley, this one in the village of Olta in the province of La Rioja. The writer of the song, however, the composer Juan de Dios Filiberto, was inspired to write the song by the brightly colored Caminito in La Boca, and put Filiberto’s poem to music. So the lyrics of Caminito reference one alley, while the music is inspired by another. As is the case with many romanticized places, Caminito itself actually came from unsavory origins. Initially it was a bridge over a tiny stream, but when that dried up it was filled in. Later it housed railways which soon ended up abandoned, and after that, a dump. Caminito owes its restoration to artist Benito Quinquela Martín, known for painting the rough port life around La Boca. In the 1950s, Quinquela Martín began painting the buildings of Caminito vibrant colors, and eventually built a small stage at the end of the walk. His tenacity established the path as an artists’ community, and in combination its tango fame, Caminito lives on as a Buenos Aires landmark."
16,Palacio Barolo,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",A tower devoted to — and modeled after — the Divine Comedy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palacio-barolo,"Located a minute’s walk from Argentina’s national legislature, at the end of Buenos Aires’ Avenida de Mayo, the Palacio Barolo, once South America’s tallest building, still towers above the neighboring structures. Work began on the building in 1919 and was completed in 1923, but its attraction extends far beyond its former title, or even its place among Buenos Aires’ scads of building-relics from its golden age as an emerging world capital. Conceived of by cotton magnate Luis Barolo and architect Mario Palanti as a secular temple, the Palacio Barolo serves as an allegory for the structure and content of Dante Allighieri’s Divine Comedy. Believing that Europe had begun drifting toward collapse, Barolo intended the Palacio Barolo to house Dante’s ashes far away from a disintegrating European continent. His partnership with Italian architect Mario Palanti, also a Dante aficionado, resulted in the design of a structure that included the numbers most prevalent in the Divine Comedy: The building’s 22 floors (Dante divided the Divine Comedy into 22 stanzas) sit upon a foundation whose measurements conform to the golden ratio. And, like Dante’s work, the building invites visitors to progress through hell, purgatory, and heaven as they climb to the top. The lobby, a central hall adorned with inscriptions of Latin verse and monster statues, radiates out from a central dome into nine vaulted archways, which represent the nine circles of hell as described by Dante in the Inferno. Throughout these first three floors are geometric figures representing alchemical symbols for fire, the colors of the Italian flag, and Masonic symbols on the walls, floors, and still-operating antiquated elevators. The highest levels, representing heaven, begin at an observation deck with one of the few 360 degree views of the sprawling city of Buenos Aires. Climbing a few more floors to the building’s highest point (100 meters, analogous to the 100 cantos of the Divine Comedy), one arrives at a still-working lighthouse. Like the Pillars of Hercules at the mouth of the Mediterranean, Pilanti intended this tower light and another of his buildings, the Palacio Salvo in Montevideo, Uruguay, to serve as a welcome to visitors arriving from the Atlantic to the Rio de la Plata estuary. The ornament above the lighthouse, a figure of the Southern Cross constellation, aligns with the actual constellation on July 9th, Argentine Independence Day. Avenida de Mayo, between Santiago del Estero and San José"
17,Cerro Fitz Roy,"El Chaltén, Argentina","The inspiration for the Patagonia Clothing logo, Cerro Fitz Roy turns pink at sunrise.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cerro-fitz-roy,"Cerro Fitz Roy is one of the most recognizable—and one of the most dangerous—mountains in southern Patagonia. Also known as Monte Fitz Roy, this impressive mountain is situated between Argentina and Chile in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, and it is undeniably one of the most beautiful hiking areas in Patagonia. Francisco Moreno first saw the mountain in 1877, and he named it after Robert FitzRoy, captain of the HMS Beagle, who, alongside Charles Darwin, charted much of the Patagonian coast in the 1830’s. Cerro Fitz Roy is now part of Los Glaciares National Park, and it is a major attraction for visitors from around the world. The mountain can be seen from the nearby little village of El Chaltén, but the most spectacular vistas can only be accessed on foot by hiking the many trails surrounding the peak. Hikers can do day-treks, or they can rent camping gear and spend days exploring the area and meeting people along the way. The trails wind through incredibly diverse landscapes of beautifully wooded areas, open fields, and massive boulders. These paths lead to a number of pristine lakes with glaciers and the peaks of Fitz Roy serving as their backdrops. The glacial water in the streams and lakes along the hikes is potable. One thing to be sure not to miss is a sunrise hike to Lago de los Tres to see Fitz Roy lit up in the color of pink roses. The hikes range in difficulty from easy to challenging, so it is best to ask locals for advice in the visitor center of El Chaltén before setting out. The months between November and April are the best times to visit, but weather can be bad in this area and almost impossible to predict.  From El Calafate take a 4.5 hour bus ride to El Chalten where the trail heads are"
18,El Zanjón de Granados,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",Museum housed in underground tunnels that date back to Buenos Aires's earliest settlements.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-zanjon-de-granados,"A nearly 200-year-old mansion situated above a series of underground tunnels that date back to the Buenos Aires’s earliest settlements, El Zanjón de Granados is now a museum that offers one-hour tours to visitors. Some parts of the structure, including a wall comprised of seashell mortaring, date back even further. Rescued by amateur historian and Argentine chemical engineer Jorge Eckstein in 1985, the structure took 17 years to restore to its current condition. More than 130 truckloads of debris were unearthed from the structure’s tunnels. In that debris, Eckstein discovered French tiles, African pipes, English china, and many other precious objects. Displays in the museum are varied and include an old, underground slave cell and photographs of the area that date back to the 19th century."
19,Villa Epecuen,"Carhué, Argentina","Once swallowed by flood waters, this village has emerged as an eerie shadow of its former self.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/villa-epecuen-2,"In the 1920’s, Villa Epecuén and its delightful salt lake were a popular tourist retreat for Buenos Aires vacationers. Arriving by train, as many as 5,000 visitors at a time could relax in lavish quarters after taking advantage of the therapeutic waters of Lago Epecuén. The mountain lake was unusual in that its waters were saltier than any ocean—in fact, it was second only to the Dead Sea in salt content, and people suffering from depression, diabetes, and everything in-between came to soak in its healing waters—the very waters that would eventually harbor the village’s ruin. In what can only be described as a freak occurrence, a rare weather pattern developed over Villa Epecuen in 1985, causing a seiche (standing wave) in the lake. The seiche broke a dam and then shoved its way through the dike. While the devastation was slow, it was thorough—the inevitable flood gradually devoured the entire village, submerging it under more than 30 ft. of briny waters. 280 businesses and countless personal dwellings disappeared under the surface like a modern-day Atlantis. It wasn’t until 2009 that drier weather allowed the waters to retreat enough for the town to reemerge. The damage total, the village was deemed a disaster area offering no incentive to rebuild. What remains now is an eerie ghost town with rows and rows of dead, naked trees, decrepit buildings, and an entire landscape seemingly bleached out and stripped to the bone by the once-healing salt waters that ravaged everything in sight."
20,Campanópolis,"González Catán, Argentina",An Argentinian businessman facing terminal cancer built this whimsical medieval village using salvaged materials.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/campanopolis,"Antonio Campana was a self-made supermarket millionaire. When he was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer, he decided to sell everything and dedicate the rest of his life to building a dream. The land he purchased in 1976 for his vision sits at the confluence of two streams and abuts an ecological preserve. However, the pastoral location was quickly spoiled when a state agency expropriated the property for use as a landfill. By the time Campana’s lengthy legal battle to regain possession of the land was finally successful, it was already buried under several years’ worth of garbage. While the land was no longer fit for cattle grazing (which had originally been part of his plan), he was undeterred in his architectural ambitions. After leveling the land and carting off 2 million cubic meters of garbage, construction finally began in 1980 on what would become the enchanting medieval village of Campanópolis. It is a complete small village, built in an eclectic style that has invited comparisons to a Tim Burton film set. Buildings are mostly made with items recovered from the demolition of other buildings and sold as salvage. Throughout the construction process, Campana trawled countless auctions buying up doors, fences, gates, and columns, as well as decorative details like an antique barber chair, an old elevator, and one hundred typewriters. One important part of the village is made from materials gathered from discontinued railroad lines. All of this work was designed and directed by a man who had no background in architecture and drew up plans on the fly as the project evolved. In addition to the village, Campana also planted more than 100,000 trees and other plants. Overall, the village takes up about 50 acres (20 hectares) of the 495-acre (200-hectare) property; the surreal scene features fountains, bridges, an artificial lake with docks, a town church, a Dutch windmill, cobblestone streets, a “Museum of Wood” and a “House of Slag,” as well as countless other buildings, towers, passages, and secret nooks to explore. Told in 1976 that he had only five years to live, Campana survived for another 24 years, during which time he worked tirelessly on Campanópolis. When he died, further development stopped; his sons now maintain the place, but the additional plans dreamed up by the grocery-magnate-turned-medieval-city-planner remain unfinished.  Open only on Wednesdays and Fridays in the afternoon and Saturdays in the morning, visits must be reserved and paid for in advance via the official website (there is not a ticket office). The cost is about 7USD each one. The site is about 20 miles southwest of Buenos Aires, 2 miles south from González Catán station and 2km southwest from the km29 crossroad (Independencia station). If you want to come by public transport, you may take the Belgrano Sur train to González Catán station (NOT M. C. Belgrano ramal), and take the ""truchito"" bus in Posamay and Simon Perez. This bus can only be paid with AR$ bills (not Sube card) and has stop just in front of Campanopolis (Zelada and Bariloche) There is a ramal of 622 bus from Laferrere station too, it has a stop in Zelada and Bariloche. Or you can take the 88 bus in Once station to the Km31 and thake the truchito there. A taxi from Buenos Aires could be pocket-rape and less than 10% of taxis would come to Catán. Eventough Campanopolis is surrounded by shantytowns, I live near this place and I wasn't robbed yet. There is free parking inside. By km31 is Padre Mario Pantaleo's Mausoleum and it could be a touristic place too, for seizing the day in González Catán. (Plus you might meet my b&g macaw walking around Catán square at sunset)."
21,Laguna del Diamante,"Laguna Diamante, Argentina",A toxic lake near a volcanic caldera that is home to flamingos and other life.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laguna-del-diamante,"At Laguna del Diamante, there are plenty of reasons why life should not exist. To start with, the lagoon rests amongst sulphur-spewing vents within one of the world’s largest volcanic calderas - belonging to the active Argentinean volcano Cerro Galán. And it’s not just the poisonous gases you have to look out for. The hyper alkaline lagoon (with a pH level of 11) is five times saltier than sea water and has levels of arsenic that are 20,000 times higher than the amount deemed safe for drinking by the EPA. Aside from the harmful gases and toxic water, the altitude of the site presents even more dangers to life at the lagoon. At 4,600 meters above sea level, oxygen levels are low and ultraviolet light from the sun is 40% more intense than it is in the lowlands. It was quite a surprise, then, when Argentinean scientists exploring Laguna in early 2010 discovered a flock of flamingos thriving on a healthy population of particularly resistant microorganisms. Rocks at the lagoon are covered with mats of unidentified microbes, which the colony of flamingos relies on for food. Though flamingos are considered a hardy species with a knack for adapting to different conditions, the environment at Laguna del Diamante is the most extreme that the birds have been witnessed living in. The conditions at Laguna are also thought to be quite similar to those of the early Earth. Scientists are therefore hoping that studying the lagoon’s mysterious microorganisms will help reveal how life on Earth began. Another puzzle that remains to be solved is the identification of a red crystal compound that also grows on the lagoon’s rocks. Preliminary results from an X-ray diffraction study (a method for examining the structure and geometry of crystals) failed to reveal the presence of any known minerals. The case of Laguna del Diamante just serves to demonstrate not only life’s resilience but also the strange and unexpected forms it takes on to survive in Earth’s most hostile environs."
22,Floralis Generica,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",105-foot wide giant metallic flower blooms anew every day in the heart of Buenos Aires.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/floralis-generica,"Designed and paid for by Argentine architect Eduardo Catalano, the Floralis Generica, a giant silver flower, has been a striking city landmark since it opened in 2002. The enormous metal flower blooms anew each day in a pool of water next to the National Museum of Fine Arts, revealing four long stamens inside. Its six 13-meter-long petals open, which takes about 20 minutes, at eight in the morning and slowly close again at sunset, mimicking the actions of a real flower. When the petals are closed, the 18 ton flower is 75 feet tall and 52 feet wide, and when blossomed this amazing man-made flora is an incredible 105 feet wide. The constructed flower reflects the city around it in the aluminum of its petals. When the petals close at night, the flower glows red. On just four nights of the year, the petals of the Floralis Generica remain open: May 25, September 21, December 24, and 31, keeping Buenos Aires in bloom all night long. Located in Plaza de Las Naciones Unidas, near the corner of Av. Figueroa Alcorta and J. A. Biblioni, La Recoleta."
23,Ischigualasto,"Ichigualasto, Argentina",Massive rock sculptures formed during the time of the dinosaurs still stand undisturbed.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ischigualasto,"Argentina’s Valley of the Moon is a strange geological formation protected in a national park in the San Juan province in the northwestern region of the country, near the border that it shared with Chile. The Ischigualasto Provincial Park is huge at more than 230 square miles and is high above sea level at more than 4,000 feet. The park features all of the vegetation you would typically find in this area - some small trees, cacti, and bushes - and is very dry with extreme temperatures. A near constant wind and little rainfall (almost all of which occurs during the summer) make this a harsh environment that is easy to visit but difficult to live in. The park gets its nickname, the Valley of the Moon, because of the rugged, otherworldly geological structures that dot the landscape. Millions of years ago, this area was a floodplain dominated by strong rivers and rainfall. In the time of the dinosaurs, these rock deposits were formed slowly over time and have stood ever since. Some of these rocks are as round and smooth as marbles because of the constant wind that has shaped them through erosion. Among the rocks, giant (some more than 130 feet tall) petrified tree trunks attest to the rich vegetation that once fed the similarly giant creatures that walked among them. Today, an area around the Valley of the Moon is known as holding some of the world’s oldest dinosaur remains. It is a popular - and important - site for paleontological research."
24,Uyuni Salt Flat,"Daniel Campos, Bolivia",A seemingly endless landscape of pure salt stretches far across Bolivia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/salar-de-uyuni-bolivian-salt-flat,"Spreading out over 11,000-sq.-km, Salar de Uyuni is the largest salt flat in the world. An endless sheet of hexagonal tiles (created by the crystalline nature of the salt), dotted with pyramids of salt, Bolivia’s salt flats are a dazzling display of nature’s magic. Despite the desert dryness, freezing night temperatures, and fierce desert sun, this landscape is not devoid of life. Pink flamingos, ancient cacti, and rare hummingbirds all live in the Salar de Uyuni. During the wet season, which is roughly from November to April, the salt desert is transformed into an enormous salt lake, albeit one that is only six to twenty inches deep, traversable by both boat and truck. During this time, the shallow salt lake perfectly mirrors the sky, creating bizarre illusions of infinity. In the middle of this seemingly infinite salty lake is a hotel built entirely out of—naturally—salt. Created from salt bricks held together with salt mortar, the hotel and everything inside it, including the chairs and tables, are made from salt. While the Hotel Playa Blanca has no electricity and little in the way of amenities (its water must be trucked in), it does offer even more important and certainly rarer qualities: utter silence, an all-encompassing austere beauty, and an astonishing view of the night sky. Also worth traveling to are the nearby Laguna Colorada and Laguna Verde. Laguna Colorada is a red-hued lake filled with thousands of pink flamingos, while Laguna Verde is a blue-green salt lake found at the foot of the volcano Licancabur. Its shifting aqua color is caused by copper sediments and microorganisms living within the lake.  Getting there. The logistics and duration of the trip to Salar de Uyuni depend on the departure point. Most tours run from three major locations: 1. Uyuni, Bolivia: The most popular starting point for salt flats tours. Uyuni is a small town packed with travel agencies in Plaza Arce. You can book a tour in advance online or use one of the local options in town. As Uyuni is so close to the flats, day trips are a feasible option. Uyuni is easily reachable by plane from La Paz (1 hour, about $130 round trip) or by bus from La Paz (10-12 hours, $30-40 one way). 2. San Pedro de Atacama, Chile: this option usually means a three-day tour. The agency drives travelers to the Chilean-Bolivian border and hands the tour over to a Bolivian tour operator. 3. Tupiza, Bolivia: This is the most popular starting point to the flats for travelers arriving from Argentina. Tour operators offer four-day tours from Tupiza, with a visit to Salar de Uyuni on the last day."
25,Bolivia's Witch Market,"La Paz, Bolivia",Popular tourist destination where witches in dark hats sell dried llama fetuses for good luck.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bolivia-s-witch-market,"Located on Calle Jiminez and Linares between Sagarnaga and Santa Cruz in, it’s impossible to miss the Witches’ Market of La Paz, Bolivia, which is found right in a lively tourist area. Dozens of vendors line the streets to sell a number of strange and fascinating products and the raw ingredients used in rituals to call on the spirits that populate the Aymara world. Among the many items sold at the market are dried llama fetuses that are said to bring both prosperity and good luck, dried frogs used for Aymara rituals, soapstone figurines, aphrodisiac formulas, owl feathers, dried turtles and snakes, herbs, and folk remedies. Witch doctors in dark hats and dresses wander through the market offering fortune-telling services. The dried llama fetuses are the most prominent product available at the market. These animals are fairly large and are used throughout the country, buried in the foundations of new buildings as an offering to the goddess Pachamama. It is believed that the buried llama fetuses keep construction workers safe, but these are only used by poor Bolivians. Wealthy Bolivians usually sacrifice a living llama to Pachamama.  Located on Calle Jiminez and Linares between Sagarnaga and Santa Cruz."
26,Great Train Graveyard,Bolivia,"On the outskirts of a desert trading village high on the Andean plain, steel giants have been destroyed by salt winds.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-train-graveyard,"It’s a cemetery for trains, for locomotives. And it’s so big that it looks as though all of the trains in South America were moved to Uyuni, Bolivia, to chug their last chug. It’s only about 3 km away from the Uyuni train station. Filled with hollowed out bodies that have completely rusted over and other remains, the “Great Train Graveyard” (also known as Train Cemetery or ‘Cemeterio de Trenes’ in Spanish) can be found on the otherwise deserted outskirts of Uyuni, a small trading region high in the Andean plain. Uyuni has long been known as an important transportation hub in South America and it connects several major cities. In the early 19th century, big plans were made to build an even bigger network of trains out of Uyuni, but the project was abandoned because of a combination of technical difficulties and tension with neighboring countries. The trains and other equipment were left to rust and fade out of memory. There are no restrictions in approaching the trains, so visitors often climb atop or go inside the train cars for taking pictures. Most of the trains that can be found in the Graveyard date back to the early 20th century and were imported from Britain. There are over 100 train cars with unique structure and occasional graffitis. In other places in the world, the mighty steel trains would have held up better. The salt winds that blow over Uyuni, which hosts the world’s largest salt plain, have corroded all of the metal. Without guards or even a fence, these pieces were picked over and vandalized long ago.  Since nearly every single salt flat tour company in town visits the Train graveyard at roughly the same time in the late morning to early afternoon, it can easily get drowned out with crowds of people, ultimately disenchanting the abandoned ambience of the place. It's best to visit in the evening (after 5 pm) or early morning (before 8 am) when the buses full of tourist are long gone/haven't arrived yet. It's in walkable distance from the center of Uyuni or you can take a cab for around 10 bolivianos ( $1,30)."
27,Abandoned Chacaltaya Ski Resort,"La Paz, Bolivia","The world’s highest ski resort was deserted after an 18,000-year-old glacier melted away.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-chacaltaya-ski-resort,"The Chacaltaya Ski Resort was once the only ski resort in Bolivia. The popular resort also had the honor of being both the highest ski resort in the world and home to the world’s highest restaurant. But when the mountain’s glacier melted, it was all but abandoned. The ski resort was opened in the late-1930s, and soon middle- and upper-class residents of nearby La Paz were flocking to its slopes. For seven or eight months of the year, people came to ski and go sledding down the Chacaltaya Glacier, at least until the cold and extreme altitude made them return to lower ground. At 17,519 feet above sea level, the Chacaltaya Ski Resort was higher than the North Base Camp of Mount Everest. For decades it held the record as the world’s highest ski resort, and the resort’s restaurant is still recognized by Guinness as the highest restaurant in the world. But in the 1990s, scientists at the Mount Chacaltaya Laboratory began to make some stark predictions. By 2015, they warned, the Chacaltaya Glacier would be gone. As it turned out, they were being optimistic. By 2009, the 18,000-year-old glacier was completely gone. With the ice and snow melted, the skiers naturally stopped coming. The resort was soon shut down and abandoned, and its ski lifts shut down. Since then, the resort has sat like a freezing ghost town on the bare rocky slopes of Chacaltaya. Today, the only near-permanent residents are two brothers, Adolfo and Samuel Mendoza, who had worked at the resort for decades and who remember when the whole mountain was covered with snow. They look after the refugio (the refuge), a building near the main resort where visitors can still find a hot meal (hence Guinness’ continued recognition of Chacaltaya as home to the world’s highest restaurant). Today, only a few tourists visit this now eerily abandoned mountaintop resort. Snow falls occasionally, sometimes enough to ski, but most people come to see the abandoned resort and to take in the views from the top of Chacaltaya, which include impressive vistas of Huayna Potosi, La Paz and El Alto (although the cities are best seen at night).  Mount Chacaltaya is about 10 miles north of La Paz, Bolivia. Tour companies in La Paz offer trips to Chacaltaya Ski Resort, which cost about Bs. 150 (about $22 USD). You can also take a taxi from La Paz, which typically costs between Bs. 200 and 240 ($29 to $35), depending on how well you haggle. The drivers will normally wait for three hours at the ski resort while you look around. The trip from La Paz to the resort takes about 1.5 hours."

Like many mountains surrounding the La Paz area of Bolivia, the gutting formations contain rich variations of mineral content, creating colorful composition throughout the drastic landscape. Said to have been named by astronaut Neil Armstrong, the Valley of the Moon is located about 10 km southwest from La Paz, near the small town of Mallasa, and while a portion of the valley has been preserved, housing is steadily popping up on the unstable soil.

Part of Bolivia’s salt wonders of the altiplano, the lake, and its nearly-extinct flamingo population draw visitors to the bizarre, otherworldly landscape. Besides flamingo, the area is home to various fauna including llamas, alpacas, Andean foxes, ​cats, and pumas. The colors of Laguna Colorada stand out immediately upon seeing it. Tinged with red algae and other microorganisms, the water is a deep orange-red hue. Perfectly contrasted, the salt lake is dotted with large white pools caused by massive borax deposits on the lake’s surface. Combined with the rolling mountains and craggy rock shores, Laguna Colorada is an immaculate and beautiful wildlife area. Laguna Colorada is part of the Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve, and in 1990 it was listed as a “Ramsar Wetland of International Importance.” Besides tourists, a rare breed of flamingo has also flocked to the area for centuries. James’s Flamingo, also called the puna flamingo, is native to the Andes and the Altiplano area. Although they seem plentiful on the shores of Colorada, they are in fact very rare. During the mid-1950s, scientists had all but written them off as extinct, until a pack was found roaming South America. Today their habitat is continually threatened, and they are classified as an endangered species."
30,Dinosaur Dance Floor,"Sucre, Bolivia","Largest site of dinosaur footprints ever found includes more than 5,000 tracks.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dinosaur-dance-floor,"A limestone wall covered with preserved dinosaur tracks was discovered in 1994 near a cement factory in southern Bolivia. Four years later, when a team of scientists led by a famed Swiss paleontologist was able to visit, the wall was named “the largest site of dinosaur tracks found so far.” It’s unclear how the wall, called Cal Orcko, went undiscovered for so long, as it is filled with more than 5,000 tracks made during the second half of the Cretaceous period about 68 million years ago. There are so many tracks, actually — and they’re placed in such strange patterns — that some scientists refer to the area as a “dinosaur dance floor.” So far, six different types of dinosaur prints have been identified. One special track that measures 347 meters is the longest dinosaur trackway ever discovered and was made by a baby Tyrannosaurus rex nicknamed “Johnny Walker” by some of the local researchers. Eight other limestone walls with dinosaurs tracks have been found in the region. Millions of years ago, when dinosaurs walked the earth, this area was part of a huge shallow lake. The tectonic plate shifts during the Tertiary period that formed the great Andes Mountains also pushed some of these limestone walls out from the bed of the lake. The rock cliff measures about 325 feet tall and juts into the sky at a 70 degree angle.  Cal Orcko is a 20-minute ride from the colonial city of Sucre. Dinosaur trucks are available from the cathedral in the main square of Sucre for 20 bolivianos return. The truck leaves three times daily."

Formed out of mudrock and erosion over hundreds of years, the stunning valley has drawn visitors for thousands of years. When people first visited this valley, they believed the spires resembled petrified souls, which gave the area its name. Since that time, a steady stream of hikers has visited the valley to marvel at the thousands of rugged peaks, which form deep gorges and many side passages and sub-valleys.

32,Horca del Inca,"Copacabana, Bolivia",Astronomical observatory above Lake Titicaca.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/orca-del-inca,"When the Spanish swept through Latin America in the 16th century, they destroyed almost everything they touched. The little they left standing, they mislabeled with incorrect European designations with no oversight from the cultures they were trampling. The Horca del Inca is a perfect example of Spanish colonial misrepresentation. Horca del Inca, which means Gallows of the Inca, is not a gallows, and was not made by the Inca. Actually, the Horca del Inca was a pre-Incan astronomical observatory, built during the 14th century by the Chiripa people. The remains of the Horca del Inca was actually a part of seven trilithic structures, positioned to study the sun, moon and stars above Lake Titicaca. Unfortunately, the other six structures were destroyed by the Spanish, leaving only one of the horizontal beams in place. The purpose of the rock structure was only discovered in 1978, when a researcher noted that the sun shone through a different rock structure onto the cross beam of the Horca during the summer solstice. With the help of local guides, the steep and dangerous path to the Horca can be traversed for a closer look at the observatory. Once near the Horca del Inca, the hill offers stunning views of Lake Titicaca and Copacabana. Accessible from Copacabana"

Salvador Dalí was a Spanish painter best known for dreamy, sometimes eerie, nonsensical images against a minimalistic backdrop, the most well-known examples of which include The Persistence of Memory and The Elephants. Though Dalí never painted this particular Bolivian reserve, the arid, stark desert horizon coupled with strange rock formations strikes a strong resemblance to the famous surrealist’s work. The Árbol de Piedra, or Stone Tree, could be one of Dalí’s disturbing subjects. The base of the rock has been weathered away by wind and time, while the top remained intact. The seemingly impossible structure stands 23 feet tall and casts its shadow even longer across the flat sandy Desierto de Siloli.  There are unpaved dirt roads and tracks within the preserve; best to get a guide and driver."
34,Laguna Verde,Bolivia,"This lake’s emerald green waters are a spectacular sight, but it’s not a great place for a swim.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laguna-verde,"Laguna Verde lies in the extreme southwest of Bolivia, not far from the border with Chile. Depending on the strength of the winds, which whip up the water, minerals, and sediments within it, the color of the lake ranges from a tranquil turquoise to a brilliantly frothy emerald. The Altiplano, or high plains, region of Bolivia is known for its spectacular landscapes. The most famous of them all is Salar de Uyuni, the largest salt flat in the world. And to the south of the salt flats lie a series of high altitude lakes, many of which are known for—and named after—their distinct colored waters. Laguna Colorada is arguably the most famous lake in the region, both for its striking red waters and the thousands of pink flamingos who come to feed on its plankton. About 40 miles south of Laguna Colorada lies Laguna Verde, a smaller but no less spectacular lake with distinctly different characteristics. Laguna Verde, as the name suggests, is very, very green. And at times it looks… kind of toxic. Which is why flamingos choose not to feed in this particular lake. Laguna Verde has high concentrations of lead, sulfur, arsenic and calcium carbonates, making it less than appealing to all but the most resilient extremophiles. And due to the high mineral content, the waters of Lake Verde can remain liquid at temperatures as low as -6.16 degrees Fahrenheit (-21.2 degrees Celsius). But these same minerals give the lake its fantastic green color, making it a hotspot for photographers and fans of strange scenery. The picturesque nature of Laguna Verde is further enhanced by the presence of Volcán Licancabur, a stratovolcano whose near perfect cone rises up less than three miles to the southwest of the lake. Licancabur is considered a holy mountain, and archaeological sites have been found on its slopes and summit crater, which is said to have once concealed an Inca crypt.  Laguna Verde is located inside the Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve in the extreme southwest of Bolivia, in the Sur Lípez Province of the Potosí Department. A narrow causeway separates Laguna Verde from the neighboring Laguna Blanca (White Lake), whose white color is also the result of minerals in the water. Many tourists visit the lakes during a multiday tour, which is often combined with Salar de Uyuni. The best time to visit Laguna Verde is during the dry season from April to September. Always take warm clothing, as the high altitude and strong winds can make for some extremely chilly conditions even when the sun is shining brightly (so don’t forget your sunscreen, either)."
35,North Yungas Road,"Nor Yungas, Bolivia",Death road of Bolivia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/north-yungas-road,"Due to abysmal driving conditions, Yungas road in Bolivia has earned the nickname “Death Road,” and is included in several lists of the planet’s most dangerous routes. The road connects the Bolivian capital of La Paz with the low-lying region of Yungas in the Amazonian rainforest. In order to do so, the road must traverse the mighty Cordillera Oriental mountain chain. Starting from La Paz, the world’s highest capital at 3,660 meters in altitude, Yungas road first climbs to 4,650 meters at La Cumbre Pass and then makes a steep descent to the town of Coroico, at an altitude of only 1,200 meters. This drop of over 3,650 meters is one of the longest stretches of continuous downhill road in the world. By some estimates, between 200 and 300 people die a year on the road. Built in the 1930s by Paraguayan prisoners during the Chaco War, at places, it was cut into the steep cliffside. One side of the road is solid rock, and the other falls off into a 600-meter abyss. Most of the road is only 3.5 meters wide, and some sections are unpaved, without guardrails. Warm and humid winds from the Amazon hit upon the eastern slopes of Andes bringing heavy rains and fog drenching the already dangerous road in torrents of water. There are numerous mudslides and tumbling rocks, and small waterfalls occasionally rain down from the cliff sides. To make matters even worse, one is likely to meet groups of cyclists along this road. Internet fame turned this road into a destination for extreme sports enthusiasts, especially downhill bikers. Several tour operators organize such trips. Prices range roughly between $50-$100. At least 13 riders have died in various accidents in last the 10 years. Besides safety, travelers should also keep in mind that the downhill ride offers a change in temps from freezing to sweltering, thus, they should dress accordingly. Such conditions made several precautions necessary. Special rules apply at Yungas road. While the rest of Bolivia drives on the right side, here vehicles drive on the left. A driver on the left has a better view of the edge of the road. Furthermore, descending vehicles never have the right of way and must move to the outer edge of the road. This forces fast vehicles to stop so that passing can be negotiated safely. The government of Bolivia is trying to improve safety on its roads, but construction in such extreme terrain is costly and slow. The northernmost section of the original road has been replaced by an alternative route with a modern and much safer two-lane motorway. The road has gained certain attention in popular culture, including Top Gear’s Bolivia Special and the BBC show World’s Most Dangerous Roads. Update as of October 2020: Today, a new paved highway has safely diverted most vehicle traffic including buses off of the so-called Death Road leaving the original curving, narrow, dirt route to guided bike tours and individual drivers looking for an adventure.  Take some extra money with you if you fancy zip sliding down three zip lines at speeds of up to 52 miles/hr at the village at the bottom of the road."
36,Cholita Wrestling,"La Paz, Bolivia",The celebrity luchadores of La Paz are tough ladies in traditional petticoats and braids.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cholita-wrestling,"Professional wrestling has a place among many cultures in Latin America, with masked luchadores taking to the ring from Mexico to Argentina. In La Paz, the most celebrated fighters of the night don’t wear spandex and masks, but bowler hats and frilly skirts. The Cholitas are the main event of the wrestling matches held at the Coliseo. The venue sits within a rapidly growing city filled with recent immigrants from rural Bolivia and the largest Amerindian population in the world. “Cholita” was traditionally a derogatory name for lower class women of mixed indigenous heritage. These wrestlers reclaim the term while poking fun at themselves, wearing the traditional costume of peasant women and playing up their feistiness. Much like professional wrestling in the U.S., lucha libre emphasizes theatrical entertainment over a real fight. The Cholitas really are tough though—they swing each other around the ring, bonk each other on the head, yank long braids, and pin each other in headlocks. They also spar with male opponents (and are usually the favorites in such matches). The matches are “supposed” to be confined to the ring, but when things get out of hand the luchadores are known to tussle throughout the auditorium and use all kinds of zany props. The most famous Cholitas even get the audience involved—they will steal beverages and kisses from handsome fans. Wrestling events take place at the Coliseo Cerrado Julio Borelli Viterito. Tickets can be purchased at the gate and several local tour operators offer tours including an English speaking guide, entry and transport. Cholitas is no longer held at the Multifunctional."
37,Chincana Ruins,"Comunidad Challapampa, Bolivia",Mysterious Incan ruins on a tiny island in Lake Titicaca.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chincana-ruins,"Isla del Sol (Island of the Sun) is a small island in Bolivia’s Lake Titicaca. On the northern side of the island is Chincana, an Incan settlement now in ruins. The Chincana ruins bear testimony to the island’s rich pre-Columbian history, as an important spot for Incas trading across the lake. Though the most ancient archaeological evidence unearthed at this site dates back to 2,200 BC, most of the ruins date to the 15th century, the time when Topa Inca Yupanqui (intriguingly translated as “Noble Inca Accountant”) was the Incan emperor. Yet there are speculations that a large structure was already in place here, and work was undertaken to expand it. Topa Inca Yupanqui became famous for extending the territory of the Inca Empire to the south, including Isla del Sol. The Chincana ruins center around this large structure, the Inca’s Palace. What remains of the palace today is a collection of stone walls and doorways laid out on a slope of the island. Within this complex is there is also a small well. Smaller and less preserved ruins can be found in the area surrounding the palace. Although it’s called a palace, it is unclear what this structure was supposed to be for. It doesn’t help that Chincana literally means “the place where one gets lost.” Some claim Isla del Sol to be the birthplace of the Incan Empire. According to one version of the Inca mythology, Manco Cápac was the son of Inti, the Sun God, and he was sent to Earth to found the Inca Empire. Manco Cápac was also venerated as the God of Fire. A disputed legend has it that Manco Cápac and his wife Mama Uqllu first appeared in a human form on Isla del Sol. This detour in the Inca mythology may not be supported by overwhelming evidence (the level of certainty as to what the Inca actually believed increases as more pieces of the puzzle are added), but it does provide an etymological explanation of the name of the island. A cynical mind could argue that rooting the mythological birth of the empire in the emperor’s newly annexed territories may have been an astute political move.  To get to Isla del Sol you’ll need to get a boat from Copacabana. It takes 1.5 hours to Yumani (in the south) and 2 hours to Challapampa (in the north). Once on the island, there are no roads and no motorized traffic. It is possible to visit the Chincana ruins on a day trip from Copacabana, but most of the day will be spent on the boat. The advantage of a day trip is that the boat will drop you at Challapampa, not too far from the ruins. An alternative to a day trip is spending one or two nights on the island—accommodation is available in both Yumani and Challapampa. This would allow you to hike across the whole island following the ancient Incan trail following the ridge of the hills, taking in great views of the Island, the lake, and the Cordillera Real at a distance. Beware that Lake Titicaca is already at a respectable 12,507 feet of elevation, and you’re only going higher."
38,Mi Teleférico,"La Paz, Bolivia",The soaring gondola lines form the longest aerial cable car system in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mi-teleferico,"Flying into La Paz gives a glimpse of the rugged terrain the city is built on. It reveals densely packed buildings clinging to vertical hillsides, seeming to flow down into the valley like a river of red roofs, all bordered by looming mountains. Thankfully, this spectacular birds-eye view isn’t reserved solely for airplane passengers or actual winged creatures. The La Paz–El Alto metropolitan area uses a sprawling cable car system as its main mode of transportation, making a trip between the cities of La Paz and El Alto seem more like a ride at a fair than a routine commute. Colorful gondolas whizz above the cities and mountainsides, connected to a network of cables that stripe the sky. Mi Teleférico is the first urban system to use cable cars as its main method of transportation. When it was built, it was said to be the world’s longest aerial cable car system. Originally, the transit system had three lines: Red, Yellow, and Green, which symbolized the Bolivian flag. It expanded in 2017 to include two more lines, and future ones are also in the works. Each line has multiple stops. You can spend a day riding the cable car, taking in the sights while soaring through the air. You’ll discover quaint rooftop patios and other intriguing finds hidden among the brightly colored buildings. The address leads to the station for the Green Line in La Paz. A ticket costs 3 Bolivianos, but you will need one for each line. You can buy them all at once to avoid standing in lines. The red line stops at the Cemetery General and then goes up to El Alto. It’s a quick ride to El Alto on the cable car which would otherwise be a long bus ride."
39,Cementerio General,"La Paz, Bolivia","In La Paz's huge, city-sized cemetery, the deceased are stored in rows of apartment-like buildings.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cementerio-general,"In the Bolivian capital of La Paz, overcrowding is not restricted to the living. The city’s cemeteries are so full that that a crypt in the biggest one, the Cementerio General, is only reserved for 10 years, after which the remains need to be cremated and collected by the deceased’s family, or stored in a smaller space. Since its establishment in 1826, the Cementerio General, located between the city’s historic center and El Alto, has grown so much in size that it resembles a city in itself. Spread over 1.5 miles, the equivalent of 15 city blocks, the predominant sites are rows of individual concrete compartments, each set in structures over four stories high. The compact tombs stacked one above another are framed by a shrine covered with glass, which are decorated with flowers, photos, and other mementos that are placed there by bereaved families. These are added with the help of ladders to aid the deceased’s journey into the afterlife, and are part of a tradition where death is seen a continuation of life. The building facades painted with colorful murals frame an intricate series of alleys, where relatives organize parties, lunches, and family gatherings in front of their loved ones, and even play songs to the dead. The cemetery becomes even more boisterous during the “Day of the Dead” festivities, where each family visits their beloved relatives and spends the entire day there, feasting and celebrating. This colorful exterior masks the cemetery’s problems that are continually exacerbated by its rapid expansion and huge demand. Many people are buried without order and documents, and others are evicted if cemetery fees have not been paid. If fee deadlines are missed or cannot be met, the bodies are sometimes removed and cannot be traced. Easiest access from the Red Teleferico in central La Paz. Second stop before El Alto."
40,The Royal Portuguese Cabinet of Reading,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",This stunning Brazilian library contains the largest collection of Portuguese texts outside of Portugal itself.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-royal-portuguese-cabinet-of-reading-rio-de-janeiro-brazil,"Rising three-stories above the central study area on each wall, the book collection contained in the Royal Portuguese Cabinet of Reading has created one of the most stunning examples of “library porn” on the planet as well as showing the history and breadth of writing that has come out of Portugal. The doors of this massive library were opened in 1887, bringing a nearly endless collection of Portuguese texts to readers in Rio de Janeiro, then the capital of the Empire of Brazil. The cabinet was founded in 1822 by a trio of Portuguese immigrants who wanted to bring their country’s literary tradition to the newly independent nation of Brazil, which had previously been a Portuguese colony since 1500. The collection’s current home was built specifically to house their growing collection, and was designed to evoke a Gothic-Renaissance influence that was popular at the time. At 350,000 titles, the collection soon became the largest collection of Portuguese works outside of Portugal; it includes rare original manuscripts, singular works of literature, and unique proofs. Today the collection receives around 6,000 new titles a year and the collection is rising towards 400,000 volumes. The walls are lined with rising strata of stacks creating one of the most fantastical atmospheres in the world. There are also paintings and other pieces of Portuguese cultural ephemera contained in the collection, making it not only a jaw-dropping library, but a vital accumulation of Portugal’s history."
41,Largo do Boticário,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",Crumbling remnant of Rio's colonial past tucked behind Corcovado mountain in the neighborhood of Cosme Velho.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/largo-do-boticario,"Once the site of Sargeant Major Luis Joaquim da Silva Souto’s farm, this square was home to the apothecary that produced all varieties of medicines and ointments for the royal family of Brazil. After years of service to the crown, the square eventually fell into disrepair until famed Brazilian journalist Sylvia de Arruda Botelho Bittencourt and her husband helped restore the plaza. One of the notable houses, A Casa Cor-de-Rosa (The Pink House), was once owned by the couple. The brightly painted houses are a perfect representation of late 18th century Portuguese colonial architecture, and the plaza is a calm and verdant oasis in the center of a city. The sound of the river Carioca and the buildings that stand in a state of quiet disrepair give the whole place a very laid back and unfussy atmosphere that is a pleasant chaser to a night of dancing in Lapa. Away from aggressive beach vendors and taxi cabbies, soaking in the spirit of old Rio in the Largo do Boticario is an intimate experience. The painters and art dealers who live in the area are generally welcoming and sometimes let visitors into their homes for a small tip. Its status as a somewhat obscure tourist attraction and out of the way location makes it an attractive stop for those who wish to explore the more traditional neighborhoods of Laranjeiras and Cosme Velho, which are in themselves filled with odd curiosities and low key attractions.  Take a bus that runs to the end of Cosme Velho to the Rodoviaria. From there continue to walk up the hill and it will be on your right in a couple blocks. If you've come to a large and intimidating tunnel, you've gone too far."
42,Vale da Lua,"Alto Paraíso de Goiás, Brazil",After millennia of erosion by sand and churning water this Brazilian valley now looks like a lunar fantasy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vale-da-lua,"Located just near the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park in Goiás, Brazil the otherworldly rock formation known as the Vale da Lua is a mesmerizing landscape of undulating pits and hollows that look like nothing so much as the surface of the moon, just don’t visit on a rainy day. Thanks to the roaring Rio São Miguel, the rocky grey landscape has been carved by eons of sand and water into a landscape like no where else on Earth. Countless pots and bulbous craters have been created as the water ebbed and flowed in irregular surges. The smoothed rock were once lave floes that cooled to create the sculpt-able geology that makes the area so stunning. Small pools and eddys collect in the spherical cutouts but the river iself has largely receded to leave its creations exposed. Of course the river is not always so visitor friendly. During heavy rains, the valley floods quickly and violently, making it off limits whenever the skies cloud over. The Vale da Lua is located on private property near to national forest, however it is still open to visitors. However since it is not a part of the park, a guide is generally required to locate the spot. To exacerbate this requirement, rumor has it that local guides routinely remove signs that would otherwise lead to the valley."
43,Crypt of the São Paulo Cathedral,"São Paulo, Brazil",The crypts are so large they're basically their own underground church.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crypt-of-the-sao-paulo-cathedral,"The Metropolitan Cathedral of São Paulo is the cathedral of the Archdiocese of São Paulo, Brazil. The building, which is the city’s largest Catholic church, has a crypt so big it’s basically its own underground church. The massive crypt is located under the main altar. The vast hall, which is supported by beautiful Gothic-style arches and columns, is decorated with marble sculptures that depict the history of the biblical figures Job and Saint Jerome. São Paulo’s bishops, archbishops, and other historically important people are buried within. It’s the final resting place for people like Father Diogo Feijó, who was a regent of Brazil during Emperor Dom Pedro II’s 19th-century reign and Bartolomeu Lourenço de Gusmão, a visionary and the creator of an 18th-century airship design. The crypt also houses the giant brass tomb of Chief Tibiriçá, a 16th-century native who converted to Christianity and helped the Portuguese Jesuits colonize São Paulo. Construction on the neo-Gothic cathedral began in 1913 and lasted for four decades. Over 800 tons of rare marble were used in its making. Everything except the towers were completed in time for the city’s 400th anniversary in 1954. Despite having a Renaissance-style dome, the cathedral is still known as the world’s fourth largest neo-Gothic temple. It’s the main house of worship for the parish of Our Lady of the Assumption of São Paulo, which was created on August 10, 1591.  The cathedral is located straight out of Sé metro station (on the red line), but is also easily reachable on foot from São Bento and Liberdade metro stations (on the blue line). Visits to the crypt are allowed everyday during set times and need not be scheduled beforehand. Price of admission is R$8.50 for an adult ticket and children younger than seven years old do not have to pay. The ticket includes a guided tour who speaks Portuguese, Spanish and English. Unless you take ""forgive those who trespass against us"" seriously, be alert when walking around outside the Cathedral and hyper aware of your surroundings as the site is a notorious hunting ground for pickpockets and muggers despite the increased police presence. Be careful."
44,World's Largest Cashew Tree,"Parnamirim, Brazil","You feel like you're in a forest, but you're actually walking amidst the branches and trunks of a single giant tree.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-largest-cashew-tree-maior-cajueiro-do-mundo,"About 20 minutes south of Natal, Brazil, is one of the world’s great arboreal attractions. California’s giant sequoias and redwoods are famous, and rightly so. But the world’s largest cashew tree, or cajueiro, is a unique experience within the woody wonders of the world. Strolling inside the sprawling canopy, you may think you are walking in an entire lush, green forest of cashew trees, but you are actually walking within one single tree. The tree covers about two acres, almost the size of two football fields, equivalent to about 70 normal-size cashew trees. The age of the giant tree is murky. Some think it was first planted in 1888, but others claim it’s thousands of years old. In any case it still produces a large amount of fruit and nuts. (In Brazil, the cashew tree is prized more for its delicious but, alas, un-transportable fruit even more than its nuts.) The tree’s record size is believed to be the result of two different genetic mutations. One, the branches grow sideways instead of upwards, eventually being weighted down and touching the ground. Second, instead of just growing along the earth as expected, when a branch touches the soil it sets down roots. Thus the tree spreads like a forest with multiple trunks growing over the two acres. Making the experience even more wonderful is the beautiful drive along the Brazilian coast down from Natal. The tree is located near the popular Praia de Pirangi (Pirangi Beach) in Brazil’s Rio Grande do Norte state. Just follow the cashew-shaped signs and you will be at the tree in 20 minutes. Admission is cheap. Yes, they charge admission to a tree. The tree is surrounded by an equal or greater amount of acreage dedicated to souvenir shops selling all sorts of cashew-themed souvenirs.  The cashew-flavored cachaca (a Brazilian sugar cane based alcohol) is highly recommended to bottle those memories of your visit to O Maior Cajueiro do Mundo, the World’s Largest Cashew Tree."

The cave is a part of one of the largest flooded cavities on the planet. Called the Gruta Do Lago Azul, or the Blue Lake Grotto, the large cave is filled with a pool of astonishingly clear blue water. Thought to be over 200 feet deep, the water turns a particularly beautiful blue when sunlight shines through a hole in the ceiling of the cave, and makes the water shimmer in the light. It is believed that the lake is fed by an underground river yet to be located. In 1992, a Franco-Brazilian expedition went cave diving and found a surprise: thousands of prehistoric animal bones - giant mammals from the Pleistocene era – lay on the bottom of the grotto. From saber tooth tigers to giant sloths, the underwater site is tremendously rich in giant mammal fossils."

It has been featured in music videos for Pharell Williams, Snoop Dogg, and the Black Eyed Peas, but remains relatively quiet as its out of the way for most tourists. Once owned by industrialist Enrique Lage and his wife, a famous singer during her time, the mansion was remodeled in the 1920s by Italian architect Mario Vodrel. Decades later, in the 1960s, the land was converted into a public park and walking trails were installed through the subtropical forests of Tijuca National Park that surround the mansion. Monkeys can be seen feasting in the trees high above the trails. The grounds also include musty old stables, a mysterious cave, a castle-like tower, a massive aquarium. The mansion now houses an art school, the Escola de Artes Visuals do Parque Lage (Visual Arts School of Parque Lage), which showcases galleries of student art to visitors and hosts a courtyard cafe. Also, from the back-end of the park begins a hiking trail that leads to the top of Corcovado, just below Christ the Redeemer (Cristo Redentor in Brazilian Portuguese), passing by waterfalls on your way up."

In Brazil, they build tall towers of cement-like Earth. These termite mounds can grow quite large with diameters up to 30 meters, and towers reaching heights of 7 meters or more. Not only do they provide a home for up to several million termites, they’re also used as nesting sites for the Buff-breasted Paradise-Kingfisher and as home to hundreds of glowing Pyrophorus beetle larvae. At night, the termite mounds look like they’re wrapped in Christmas lights. A UNESCO World Heritage site, Emas National Park is a wonderland of waterfalls, mountains, and savannah. You can find maned wolves, rhea (large, ostrich-like birds), tapirs, toucans and jaguars roaming here. And while any of these is worth a visit, the most breathtaking nocturnal site is the series of glowing termite mounds. The Pyrophorus nyctophanus beetle (also known as the Headlight Beetle) is bioluminescent as an adult, but it’s the larvae that truly shine. Adult beetles lay their eggs in the sides of termite mounds. When the young hatch, they glow with a green light bright enough to read by. While the adults eat plants, the young are carnivorous and their lights are a lure. Unsuspecting insects will make their way towards the pretty lights only to be seized for a meal by the voracious larvae. And yes, termites are a favorite food. In fact, the larval growth cycle is timed to take advantage of termite migrations, and many a termite will meet its end in the jaws of an inconsiderate houseguest. The glowing mounds are best seen in the savannas during the summer, though they can be found in the jungles as well. The terrain can be quite rugged, but there are several private tour outfits that can guide you."

Construction on the Rio-Santos Highway began in the 1960s and by 1976 the stretch of road was due to be linked to the existing highway. However, the plans were altered at the last minute so that the existing road was linked to a coastal route and the newly constructed, but never used viaduct was simply abandoned. Over 40 meters tall and 300 meters long, the elevated roadway features tunnels, retaining walls, and a massive concrete foundation all being slowly taken over by the surrounding greenery. While the abandoned civic project seemed wasteful at the time, it is now a popular tourist attraction for travelers looking to do some rappelling and bungee jumping. The abandoned Viaduct Petrobras can be accessed from the Salesopolis Caragua neighborhood in Porto Novo via a thin country road, but the structure must be approached on foot or motorbike for the final stretch."

Construction on the massive cathedral began in the late 1960s, and continued on into the 1970s. Designed by architect Edgar Fonseca, the modern temple was intended to echo the ancient Mayan pyramids. The church can hold as many as 20,000 people (if standing room is included), and includes a museum in the basement, a markedly more efficient use of space than the Mayans had. It also incorporates features such as ornate doors made of dozens of religious-themed bronze plaques. While each tilting wall of the modern pyramid is covered in small, square windows that give it the look of a space-age honeycomb, towering stained glass windows run down the center of each wall as well. The giant colored windows reach over 200 feet up from the floor, straight to the tip of the church. At the top, they connect to the four points of a crucifix-shaped skylight, that is set into the flat ceiling, made up of the same honeycomb pattern of panels as the walls. It is the rare church that appeals to faithful religious churchgoers and godless fans of science fiction architecture, but the Rio de Janeiro Cathedral surely won’t disappoint either."

It is also a city where street art is celebrated, and by walking 560 feet along Rio’s waterfront, you can appreciate the largest mural graffiti in world, a Guinness World Record accomplishment and a legacy of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. The work depicts a Tajapo boy from Brazil, a Mursi woman from Ethiopia, a Kayin woman from Thailand, a Supi man from Northern Europe, and a Huli man from Papua New Guinea. They represent humanity’s common ancestors, the indigenous people from America, Asia, Europe, Africa and Oceania. Eduardo Kobra, a world-renowned Brazilian graffiti artist, studied the features of people from five continents that represent the black, blue, green, red, and gold rings on the Olympic flag. Etnias (or Ethnicities), or as it was originally named by the artist Todos Somos Um (We Are One), is a visual feast for street art lovers and a way to celebrate the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, the first and only time the event was hosted in South America. As he carries the core values of the Olympic Games, the artist’s intention was to show that everyone is connected, We Are One. Kobra’s work makes us feel his characters’ intense and powerful gaze, so we can feel our common wisdom. The Rio Olympics broke not only sports records, but also one unexpected one, creating the largest street mural spray-painted by one single artist. This work was commissioned by the International Olympic Committee and it is nearly twice the size of the mural that held the previous record in Mazatlan, Mexico, as artist Ernesto Rocha’s mural was just 18,066 square feet. Kobra worked for 12 hours a day, for two months, so he could complete Etnias just before the opening ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. About 100 gallons of white paint, 400 gallons of colored paint, and 2,800 cans of spray paint were used by Kobra and his team. But, after all his work, the artist didn’t get to stay and enjoy the Rio Olympics, as he had to fly to Ohio to complete a mural graffiti of Neil Armstrong. Kobra is responsible for other iconic street art murals in cities such as New York, London, Tokyo and Amsterdam. His style includes bright colors, geometric shapes, and quilted patterns. Along the Olympic Boulevard, you can also find other murals by graffiti artists André Camila Cadiz, JR or Rita Wainer."

Located on the edge of the Preguiças River in Brazil, the seeming desert region is just adjacent to the tropical Amazon Basin which is generally lush, wet, and green. This being the case, the Lençóis Maranhenses dunes are subject to the nearby area’s torrential rainy seasons. Between the months of July and September, the depressions between the dunes fill with rainwater creating pools ranging from small ponds to deep lakes. Like any real desert, the 1,500 square kilometer area supports little plant life despite the rain, but the transient bodies of water amazingly populate with marine life each year as migratory birds accidentally deposit fish eggs in the waters. Most of the underwater life dies off when the pools evaporate during the dry season, but the local human population is able to maintain a healthy fishing trade nonetheless. The Lençóis Maranhenses Dunes are recognized as a national park and are closely protected, not allowing vehicles within the recognized borders of the park, but it’s just as well since breaking down in the desert is bad enough without having to worry about drowning."

But were it not for a devastating earthquake and a Napoleonic invasion, it may never have reached such heights. On November 1, 1755, a massive earthquake almost destroyed the city of Lisbon, the capital of the Kingdom of Portugal. Between 10,000 and 100,000 people were killed in the city, and countless buildings turned to rubble, in what remains one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. Also lost in the quake was the 70,000-volume Royal Library inside the devastated Royal Ribeira Palace. At the time, this library was considered one of the finest and most important in Europe. Soon after the earthquake, King Joseph I of Portugal organized the construction of a new Royal Library, and over the next half century the collection grew significantly with many valuable books and prints. Still, the threat of another major quake loomed over the library, prompting talk of moving the entire collection to the Portuguese colony of Brazil. The Napoleonic Wars gave the royal collection its final push towards the New World. When an Imperial French corps under Jean-Andoche Junot invaded Portugal in 1807, Portugal’s then Prince Regent John of Braganza (later John VI of Portugal) decided to flee to Brazil, along with the rest of the royal family. As quickly as he could, John gathered up the collection from the royal library and had it loaded onto the Portuguese fleet. The Prince Regent, along with the first batch of his prized collection, arrived in Rio de Janeiro on March 7, 1808. A second batch, packed in 230 crates, arrived in mid-1810. On October 29, 1810, John founded a new Royal Library on Brazilian soil, which would later become the Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil, or National Library of Brazil. Today, the Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil houses a collection of approximately 9 million items, and is considered one of the main national libraries in the world by UNESCO. General works account for some 2 million pieces, occupying about 11 linear miles of shelf space. The collection also contains 21,742 photos from the 19th century; 22,000 maps and about 2,500 atlases; and some 250,000 pieces in its music and sound archive. And ever since an official decree in 1907, Brazilian publishers are required to send one copy of every title they publish to the Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil, ensuring that the collection will continue to grow and grow. The Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil is located at Avenida Rio Branco 219 on Cinelândia Square in central Rio. It’s open to the public Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturdays from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m."
53,Inhotim Museum,"Brumadinho, Brazil",The largest open-air contemporary art center in Latin America is a unique experience in the Atlantic Forest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/inhotim,"When you arrive in Inhotim, you will be handed a map so you can pick your route and begin your quest. And there is much to see at this gigantic open-air contemporary art center, surrounded by 500,000 acres of botanical gardens in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The sight of an igloo or a floating block of concrete, a labyrinth of mirrors camouflaged in a way that butterflies bash into it, or a kaleidoscopic telescope, is part of the experience of a world-class collection of over 1,300 works of art produced from 1960 until today. A chauffeured golf cart will park by your side before you decide what to see first. You can choose to walk or to take a ride through lakes, valleys, forest areas, and gardens. Of Instituto Inhotim’s 500,000 acres of botanical gardens, about 100,000 are opened for visitation and ready to awe with an extensive collection of exotic and rare tropical species and numerous palm trees from all over the world. Away from the Brazilian urban setting, Inhotim allows time to contemplate and embrace contemporary art as one with the surrounding lush nature. The interactive works of art are impressive and mesmerizing. There is a pavilion where every object is red and red is the experience. In another pavilion, inspired by artists Hélio Oiticica and Neville D’Almeida’s Cosmococa, visitors enter rooms where they’re promised to experience the feeling of being on cocaine. In one room, Jimi Hendrix plays guitar while a pillow fight brings in chaos; another room is filled with hammocks; in the end, there is a lit indoor pool. There are 23 pavilions and permanent galleries of artists from 30 different countries. To some, the idea of building a gigantic museological complex, pavilions, and galleries with contemporary artwork on display in the open air in the middle of Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, might have sounded like a far-fetched, megalomaniac project. But to Brazilian billionaire Bernardo Paz, who planned out the construction of Instituto Inhotim in 2006, building one of the most daring, ambitious, and creative art museums in the world is not impossible. Today, Instituto Inhotim is an active nonprofit when it comes to developing educational programs, providing access to cultural assets to the community, and improving the quality of life in the region. The long-term plan is to turn the place into a destination in itself. Spas and resorts are being planned, and there are new pavilions under construction and plans to organize film festivals and events to promote environmental awareness, cultural empowerment, and diversity. In the future, Paz believes it will take about 12 days to fully take in this unique, unparalleled, sensorial, and aesthetic experience.  The museum does not open on Mondays. Some people end up buying multiple day passes to enjoy everything there is to see and experiment in Inhotim."
54,Images of the Unconscious Museum,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","An overlooked collection of over 350,000 artistic works created by psychiatric patients using art therapy.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/images-of-the-unconscious-museum,"Paintings, music, theater, and craftworks are just some of the ways mental health patients can express themselves during their art therapy classes in this museum and research center. These “images of the unconscious” allow viewers to establish a bridge between their own world and the deepest yearnings, fears, traumas, joys, and dreams of the artists. Inspiring and colorful, the Images of the Unconscious Museum (Museu de Imagens do Inconsciente) displays an incredible collection of art as well as the research that led to a different way of approaching psychological health. The often-overlooked museum in Rio displays more than 350,000 works by patients, and historical documents about the process. Nise da Silveira, a pioneering female psychiatrist who introduced Carl Jung’s work to Brazil, founded the Museum of Images of the Unconscious in 1952 as a research center and collection of works created by patients. Silveira didn’t believe in the contemporary inhumane forms of treatment like electroshock therapy or lobotomization. She created a clinic where patients could freely express themselves through art. Her research in occupational therapy brought new insights into the images of the unconscious, and she studied the emotional bond between patients and animals, whom she considered co-therapists. Silveira’s work is as important to the medical community as it is to the art world. Books, movies, and documentaries have been inspired by her research and her patients’ artworks. Entirely dedicated to the study and research of mental health, the Brazilian museum and research center is recognized worldwide for its groundbreaking work and unique art collection. It is registered by the National Historical and Artistic Heritage Institute."

Just what is behind the glowing shelves that make up the front of the Livraria da Vila? Upon entering, you will know that it is simply this - a bibliophile’s happy place. The doors themselves reveal what lies behind them, as they are made of bookshelves covered in glass, and open up into a beautifully-lit atrium-style bookstore. After going through the unique yet theme-appropriate doors, you’ll find yourself surrounded by shelves and shelves of books, these cases open for the perusing, unlike the ones that you passed through to enter. Black bookshelves line the walls of each soft white room and line themselves across the stairways, urging you to pick up a book and read. The closest metro stations are Oscar Freire (on the yellow line) and Consolação (on the green line). There is an English language section in the book store with a superb collection of titles, including quite a few Penguin classics in both hardback and softcover."
56,Marble Caves of Chile Chico,"Puerto Río Tranquilo, Chile",Mother Nature outdoes herself with this stunningly beautiful set of caves carved into marble.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marble-caves-of-chile-chico,"Carved into the Patagonian Andes, the Cuevas de Mármol are located on a peninsula of solid marble bordering Lake General Carrera, a remote glacial lake that spans the Chile-Argentina border. Formed by 6,000-plus years of waves washing up against calcium carbonate, the smooth, swirling blues of the cavern walls are a reflection of the lake’s azure waters, which change in intensity and hue, depending on water levels and time of year. Located far from any road, the caves are accessible only by boat. Thirty-minute tours are operated by a local company, weather and water conditions permitting. The best time of the year to visit the Marble Caves is roughly between September and February when the ice melts feeding the lake and the color of the water is particularly enchanting turquoise. In terms of hours, the best time to take a boat tour is early morning to catch the right lighting for great pictures. There are ferries from Chile Chico that will take you to and through the Marble cave and its tunnels. The caves are based on a lake, and the only way to reach them is by ferry."
57,Montaña Mágica Lodge,"Panguipulli, Chile",This odd Chilean waterfall-cano hotel must be entered via a rope bridge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/montana-magica-lodge,"Nestled in the thick jungles of Chile’s Huilo Natural Reserve (home to the Huilo-Huilo Falls, Pudu, the world’s smallest deer species, and the longest zip line system in South America), the Montaña Mágica Lodge is a fantastical waterfall/hotel/volcano that looks like it was built by ambitious hobbits. The otherworldly hotel looks as though it was dug into a natural stone spire, but the Montaña Mágica Lodge was in fact man-made. Using locally sourced lumber and stone, the creators of the lodging built up a tall cone. Water pours from the top down the sides in-between the guest windows, running under rich layers of jungle foliage growing on the exterior. Inside, each of the cozy suites is named after a local species of bird, and all feature a selection of modern amenities that rival even fancier hotels in less remote parts of the country. And if the strangeness and beauty of the hotel itself fail to impress, it offers a number of other attractions. Among the offerings are hot tubs “made out of huge trunks of trees, dug out, and then filled with hot water perched on a deck overlooking the forest.” There is also a mini golf course built into the forest itself, using the natural world as the obstacles, and there are various outdoor activities such as horseback riding, rafting, and hiking. Of course, getting to such a magical place takes a bit of doing. The ride to Montaña Mágica Lodge is at least two hours from the nearest airfield. It is a small price to pay to experience a location that looks like it belongs in Middle-Earth."
58,"""El Gigante"" and the Stone Moai of Easter Island","Easter Island, Chile",The largest stone Moai on Easter Island.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-gigante-and-the-stone-moai-of-easter-island,"One of the first realizations one has about Easter Island is, it’s not an archipelago. There are no other islands surrounding it. No, in all directions there is nothing but empty ocean for greater distances than from any other inhabited island on Earth. Easter Island is the ultimate island. Besides its remoteness, Easter Island is, of course, famous for its massive stone sculptures or “Moais.” The largest of these is “El Gigante,” located near the Rano Raraku Quarry, which stands some 72 feet tall (well, 71.93 to be exact). El Gigante weighs in at an astonishing 160-182 metric tons, more then the weight of two full 737 airplanes. However, El Gigante was ambitious even for the master movers of Easter Island. Experts believe that had they finished this Moai (there is some question as to whether they ever intended to), it is unlikely the islanders would have been able to move it. In comparison, Paro, the largest Moai ever erected, is 10 meters (33 ft) high, and weighs 75 metric tons. Though the giant statues have been the subject of many conspiracies and myths, one gradually realizes there are few major mysteries left about them. We know who built them (Polynesian colonizers of the island, the early Rapanui people), how they were built (carved mostly from tuff and polished smooth by rubbing with pumice), how they were likely transported (wooden sledges, log rollers, and ropes), when they were built (between 1250 and 1500 CE), and very probably why. These sculptures (often called heads, though they are in fact disproportionately sized full-body figures, often seen buried halfway in dirt) represent specific ancestors. These representations were erected between the village and chaos — the ocean — as a wall of protection. The two major tribes of Easter Island lived in a tropical rain-forest, a paradise of food and fishing, with plenty of time to put into the Great Work of the statues. According to resident archaeologist Edmundo Edwards, the Polynesians used to sail back and forth across the great distances among the Pacific islands, but at a certain point they used up all the large trees and thereby lost the ability to make large canoes. At this point they became trapped. The old middens (a dump for domestic waste) show that fish bones got progressively smaller as the Polynesians could no longer sail out to deep fisheries. The island is only 45 square miles total. In the 16th and 17th centuries, statue building accelerated, and the population grew, reaching around 40,000. Then, around the year 1160, the whole thing collapsed. Some 2,000 people live on the island now, and the landscape is barren. No trees grow here except for a few invasive and problematic eucalyptus groves. How could a people smart enough to navigate to tiny landfalls on thousands of miles of Pacific ocean and capable of vast engineering projects like the Moai statues be so unable to deal with the coming of a doom which must have been obvious on such a tiny island? It may have been easier then we imagine. A few years ago, locals on Easter Island discovered they could catch and sell lobsters from around the island. They then caught and sold those lobsters until there were no more. Though much is known about the Moais, there’s lots more archaeology to do on Easter Island than digging up stone sculptures. Researchers are just starting on the villages — and their story is one of the most compelling on Earth: Humans can make their own bad luck. In the case of Easter Island, ever larger and larger statues were not the right defense. In conjunction with the Long Now Foundation.

59,Termas Geometricas,"Panguipulli, Chile",This Japanese-inspired labyrinth of hot springs is hidden in a Chilean forest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/termas-geometricas,"Nestled in an almost unbelievably lush forest canyon in Chile, the hot spring spa known as Termas Geometricas is a stunning maze of red planks that wind through the trees like something out of a mythological Japanese wonderland. Suspended over a flowing stream, the crimson walkways leading to the various pools are made entirely of painted wood that stands out in stark contrast to the surrounding wilderness, while at the same time managing to seem right at home. There are 17 pools in total at the spa, each of them fed directly from a natural hot spring via wooden pipes that run beneath the walkways, making sure that they are largely warm and dry. Next to each pool is a small hut/changing room made of the same redwood as the paths. Each hut has grass planted on the roof, giving the whole facility a timeless feel, almost as if they are some extension of the natural backdrop. The whole thing rests at the bottom of a canyon, and mists rise from the warm waters in a nearly constant fog. Between the Japanese-styled architecture and the Chilean nature, few places in the world can claim quite such a perfect harmony of nature and design. This place is really hard to find. You must drive for about 40-50 minutes on an ""outside"" road. But it's worth it!"
60,Hand of the Desert,Chile,A sculpture of a giant hand reaches for the stars in the middle of the Atacama desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hand-desert,"The scorched moonscape of Atacama stretches for hundreds of miles on both sides of the Pan-American Highway, undisturbed by any sign of human activity. About 75km south-east of the town of Antofagasta, its monotony is shattered by a sight even more alien then the desert itself, and yet undoubtedly human: an 11-meter-tall hand protruding out of the sand. Mano de Desierto is a work of the Chilean sculptor Mario Irarrázabal, built in the early 1980s. It was financed by a local booster organization called Corporación Pro Antofagasta. The motion of hands rising from the ground is an obsession of Irarrázabal’s. His other famous works include another over-sized sculpture exploring the same idea: “Monument to the Drowned” is located on Parada 4 at Brava Beach in Punta del Este, a popular resort town in Uruguay. Another large sculpture, “The Awakening,” by American artist John Seward Johnson II expresses a similar idea and is located at National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland.  From Antofagasta, Route 26 or Route 28, both connect to Route 5. The Mano can be found between mile markers 1309 and 1310. It is easy to reach from either direction and can be seen well in advance. If you're going to drive out for a visit, be sure you have sun-screen, plenty of water, and a full tank of gas. Take caution, driving in the seemingly endless salt flats can have a wearying effect and don't let the monotony trick you into driving too fast; too many fatal accidents have occurred in the desert, as evidenced from the dozens of skeletal wrecks and road-side shrines."
61,Punta Pite,Chile,"A fantastical group of cliffside stairways, bridges, and twisting paths carved out of stone provide a surreal coastal hike.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/punta-pite,"Between Zapallar and Papudo, north of Santiago, Chile, lies 27-acre Punta Pite, a stretch of residential land that hugs the coastline. The design was intended to surrender to the geography around it, and surrender it does. Pathways along the rocks twist, widen and narrow haphazardly, with no railings available to provide assurance. Staircases appear and disappear, carved into the stone cliffs, bridging formally unreachable vistas. Flagstone walks lead through narrow passageways that open up into restored and carefully developed open spaces. These features built by human hands seem to grow organically from the landscape around them. This elaborate passageway was built between 2004 and 2006, employing more than 40 stonemasons to cut, carve, and smooth the mountainside. The oceanside trail system was the invention of landscape architect Teresa Moller, who has described her inspiration as a channeling of the words of a famous Chilean poet, who described Chile as “pure geography.” A brilliantly planned out architectural masterpiece, the entire winding trail along the water and across a restored creek creates a single, mind-blowing spatial experience that is open to the public."

Founded in 1841, the gorgeous landscape houses a collection of museums, a duck-filled pond, and paddle boats for the children to tool around in. Despite all of the new, modern features and regular care, there is one ghost from the past that still lingers, decrepit and forgotten. With ratty walls and broken glass shards sticking out on the domed roof, this old greenhouse is a reminder of the original purpose of the park - a place for greenhouses to cultivate foreign plant species. Update June 2019: There is no more glass in the greenhouse, they took it all out. Take the green metro line to Quinta Normal station"
63,World's Largest Swimming Pool,"Valparaiso, Chile","A record-breaking pool that uses computers to turn ocean water into cleaner, private swimming water.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-s-largest-swimming-pool,"Located between Chile’s San Alfonso del Mar Resort and the sea, the World’s Largest Swimming Pool essentially converts the salty public waters of the ocean to a pristine private lake. At over 1,000 yards long and 115 feet deep at its deepest point, the resort’s 20-acre pool cost around a billion dollars to build and stares down a $2 million annual upkeep bill. Despite the unlimited natural waters of the ocean which sit just over the pool wall, the resort uses state-of-the-art technology provided by a company that prides itself on being able to create swimming pools of any size, to constantly pump and filter sea water into the private lagoon and alternately back out to sea. The system also cleans the water once again before returning it to the ocean, lessening the environmental impact, but the conversion seems a bit drastic simply to provide crystal clear waters."

As tribal rituals go, that of the Birdman on Easter Island is right up there with the stuff of Hollywood. Each year, contestants were selected as competitors for the title of Birdman. Each contestant would then sponsor a representative of their choosing who would be challenged to scale the dangerous face of the Rano Kau cliff, then swim shark-infested waters to the small island of Motu Nui. There, the task was simple: find eggs laid by the elusive Sooty Tern. The first to find an egg for their sponsor was declared the winner. In turn, the sponsor (but not the one who did all of the work) would be crowned as the Birdman, or Tangata-Manu. The title allegedly earned the victor and his clan all of the benefits of a god during the year that he held the lofty title. Leaving the main town, Hanga Roa, to the south, you will pass several restored moai before coming to the Ana Kai Tangata cave. Then begins the gradual climb to Rano Kau crater and on to Orongo on top of 1000-foot cliffs. It can take a bit of leg and lung power, but is well worth the opportunity to take in the magnificent viewpoints. From Rano Kau, it’s a 15-minute walk to Orongo, where historic stone dwellings cling to the side of the cliff overlooking the ocean and the site of the Birdman Competition. The era of the Birdman Competition on Easter Island occurred post-Moai. For one and a half centuries, tribes participated in the games, with the last race taking place in 1866."
65,Elevators of Valparaiso,"Valparaiso, Chile",What was once a unique system of urban elevators is turning into a mechanical ruin.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elevators-of-valparaiso,"The port city of Valparaiso, Chile is built on dozens of steep hillsides giving the town a unique layout comprised of warrens of alleys and side streets, the improvised nature of which has earned the nickname, “The Jewel of the Pacific.” The neighborhood built on Bellavista Hill features one of the city’s most unique features with its system of boxy elevators that ferry people up and down the steep, closely-packed hill. Known as “funicular” elevators, the unusual public transit method consists of a cable car which is pulled up and lowered down a steep incline. Looking like small boxcars that are delicately balanced as the metal cable drags them up the hill, the elevators recall American railroad engineering put to some off-kilter purpose. With the first such elevator dating back to 1911, they continued to pop up around the densely populated hill, connecting formerly isolated neighborhoods, until there were 31 working elevator sites. Unfortunately with a downturn in the Valparaiso economy caused by the construction of the Panama Canal, a number of people moved from the city and many of the mechanical elevator stations fell into disrepair, or shut down completely, tragically cutting off people who had come to depend on the rails for transportation. After decades of neglect, the number of working elevators in the city has dwindled to just 14. However, efforts undertaken by the World Monuments Fund and others have begun making plans which could help preserve the unique pieces of civil ingenuity. Hopefully Valparaiso’s elevators can continue to ascend in importance so that they don’t go down forever. Not all the elevators built are working today, but there are 15 you can visit. Bring cash, even better if you bring coins. Elevators are the cheapest way to go up the hills and they usually cost less than 50 cents (100-200CHP). Two of the most popular and accessible for visitors are the Acensor Reina Victoria (connecting Avenida Cumming with Paseo Dimalow) and the Acensor El Peral (connecting Plaza Sotomayor with Paseo Yugoslavo.)"
66,Caves of the Villarrica Volcano,"Villarrica, Chile",One of Chile's most active volcanoes is riddled with beautiful caves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/caves-of-the-villarrica-volcano,"The town of Pucón, Chile lives next to a very large and sometimes very grumpy neighbor, the Villarrica volcano. Though it is called Villarrica today, its original name was Rucapillán or “House of the Pillan,” Pillan being a powerful and sometimes disaster causing spirit, according to local mythology. The Villarrica Volcano has indeed caused disaster with the earliest recorded eruption in 1558 and 65 eruptions since. Lava flows up to 18 kilometers long have come spilling out of the glacier covered volcano, and one of the more recent in 1971 killed over 200 people from toxic gas inhalation and mud slides. Despite this, most of the time the Villarrica Volcano is a beautiful sight, covered in snow, and experiencing only “Strombolian eruptions” (named after the continuously low-level erupting Stromboli volcano) small and relatively safe eruptions. Villarrica produces an almost comically iconic wisp of volcanic smoke, making it a wonderful sight to behold. Among the unique sights at the Villarrica volcano are its volcanic caves, the only caves in an active volcano, visitable on earth. One can travel hundreds of meters into the side of the active volcano and see the hardened remains of was once an active lava flow oozing out of the mountainous side."
67,Sewell Ghost Town,"Sewell, Chile","The “City of Stairs” sits high in the Andes, above the world’s largest underground copper mine.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sewell-mining-town,"Sewell Mining Town sits on a barren slope above the world’s largest underground copper mine. Founded in 1905 and abandoned in the 1970s, the so-called City of Stairs is a fascinating example of the company towns that set up shop in some of the world’s most remote locations. Situated at more than 7,220 feet (2,200 meters) above sea level in the Andes, on an exposed slope too steep for wheeled vehicles, Sewell wasn’t exactly prime real estate. But when the Braden Copper Company found plentiful reserves in them thar hills, it set about building a town to house all its workers. These workers were needed to extract copper from El Teniente (“The Lieutenant”), an underground copper mine that would become the largest in the world. Due to the steepness of Sewell’s location, the town planners had to get creative. The entire urban design was based around a large central staircase, the Escalera Central, which climbed up the hillside from the railway station down below. From this radiated a series of other pedestrian-only stairways and paths, giving the town its nickname, the Ciudad de las Escaleras, “City of Stairs.” To keep things a little more cheery, the buildings were painted a variety of colorful shades. And to save the miners and their families from a chilly descent into the depths of boredom, the company built playgrounds and plazas, shops and a social club, and even a movie theater. Alcohol was banned throughout the town, but the miners normally found a way to bring in a donkey-load of liquor. For 60 years, Sewell thrived and expanded. At its height in 1968, it was home to more than 15,000 people. But its history wasn’t short of a few tragedies. Two of the most fateful incidents occurred in consecutive years. On the night of August 8, 1944, an avalanche tumbled down from the slopes above Sewell, killing 102 people. A year later, a fire broke out at the El Teniente mine, trapping the workers inside. The incident, known as El Humo (“The Smoke”), killed 355 men, many dying from carbon monoxide poisoning. It remains the worst metallic mining accident in Chile’s history. Neither accidents nor natural disasters were the ultimate cause of Sewell’s abandonment. Instead, it was nationalization by the Allende government that brought about the town’s demise. In 1977, after six years of state ownership, the National Copper Corporation of Chile began to move families out of Sewell. And then they began to destroy the town. Thankfully, the Chilean government realized that Sewell was worth saving for posterity’s sake. It halted the demolition in the 1980s and declared Sewell a National Monument in 1998. In 2006, UNESCO designated Sewell a World Heritage Site, further protecting what is now one of the best preserved examples of a company mining town. Fifty or so colorful buildings have been faithfully restored, and an on-site museum helps explain the history of the abandoned City of Stairs.  Visiting Sewell is by tour only. Tours can be arranged in Santiago, 45 miles to the north of Sewell, or in Rancagua, 20 miles to the west."

It consists of four Unit Telescopes with main mirrors 8.2m in diameter that can be combined into an astronomical interferometer that includes a set of four movable telescopes dedicated to interferometric observations. Working together, these instruments allow astronomers to see details up to 25 times clearer than with individual telescopes. It has become an essential tool for scientific research on stars, extragalactic objects like active galactic nuclei, (regions of a galaxy that have a higher luminosity over a portion or all of the electromagnetic spectrum), and it is responsible for the discovery of carbon monoxide molecules in a galaxy almost 11 billion light-years away. The invaluable discoveries made using this incredible telescope are so copious, VLT data leads to an average of more than one scientific paper publication per day, and seven of the top ten discoveries done at ESO’s observatories are directly related to its use. The location is open for tours once a week on Saturday, book well in advance and you will be taken up onto the mountain to see the visitors center, the residentia and one of the telescopes. Adapted with permission from Exploguide.com dedicated to travelers looking for alternative and off the beaten track travel. There’s no public transportation available to get there. The only way is to rent a car in the closest city, Antofagasta, which is quite cheap regarding to the western renting prices. Cycle can be an option if you’re courageous and plan plenty of drinking water. Take the highway #5 from Antofagasta (the famous and beautiful Panamerican), heading south. About 60 km from Antofagasta, take on your right the road B70 heading south again. Then, about 10 km later, take the B710 on your left, still plain south. B710 is a dirt road which will almost bring you on the planet Mars. Follow the B710 for about 70 km more and you will spot the VLT area entrance on your right. Remember that the VLT is located in a very arid, desertic and isolated region, so take a lot of drinking water and avoid engine failures on the B710."
69,Atacama Giant,"Huara, Chile",One of the largest ancient geoglyphs in the world is a tall desert god used for predicting the weather.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atacama-giant,"Illustrated on a Chilean hillside known as Cerro Unitas and surrounded by thousands of smaller geoglyphs, the Atacama Giant, a massive image of a deity used to calculate the movements of the moon, stands as one of the largest geoglyphs ever discovered. Likely created sometime between 1000 and 1400 CE by a successive series of indigenous cultures including the Inca, the massive figure rests among about 5,000 smaller images of birds, mystical designs, and other images that have been etched on the ground. The images were created by either digging out the lines of the design from the soil, or by placing patterns of stones and sand on top of it, and sometimes a mixture of the two methods. (Successive cultures worked to create the images, which accounts for the variation.) The giant itself is 390 feet tall and built in a direct and unpretentious design with no flourishes, save for the straight lines emanating from its head and torso to imitate either some sort of ceremonial garb or the unearthly features of a god. Whichever the lines symbolize, researchers have determined that they very likely served a practical purpose as well. When they aligned with the moon, the lines in the giant’s headdress, in conjunction with the other points on its body, the image would have been used to track the time of year, so that the ancient builders could predict the coming of the crucial rainy season. While the Atacama Giant may not be the most famous geoglyph in the game (that distinction goes to the Nazca Lines), the size, clarity, and former importance of the rain god to the people who made the design, allow it to stand tall regardless."

The El Tatio geyser field, located just a few miles from the Bolivian border, is a spectacular sight for those who make the trek. At 14,173 feet (4,320 meters) above sea level, it’s a dreamlike high-altitude location surrounded by stratovolcanoes that form part of the local geothermal system. El Tatio covers an area of 12 square miles, with geysers, boiling water fountains, fumaroles, hot springs, mud pools, and mud volcanoes seeping steam across its surreal expanse. It’s the highest geyser field in the world, the largest in the southern hemisphere, and the third largest in the world after Yellowstone in the U.S. and the Valley of Geysers on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. Both the Chilean government and private companies have had a close look at El Tatio over the last 50 or so years, with the idea of harnessing the geothermal energy. So far, however, El Tatio’s relative remoteness and environmental concerns have stalled any geothermal power projects. Due to the presence of extremophile microorganisms on the vents at El Tatio, the site has also been studied as a possible analogous example of life on early Earth and potential past life on Mars. According to a study by Ruff and Framer, the unique environment and conditions of El Tatio “provide a better environmental analog for Mars than those of Yellowstone National Park (USA) and other well-known geothermal sites on Earth.” Despite the best efforts of energy companies and wannabe Martians, tourism remains the main business at El Tatio, which was declared a protected area in 2010. Visitors arrive in the early morning to see the geysers shoot steam into the air, a sight most clearly visible between 6 and 7 a.m. A certain amount of caution is advised, as bleary eyed tourists and boiling pools of water don’t tend to mix too well. Tread carefully, as numerous burn injuries and some fatalities have been recorded at El Tatio."
71,Hotel Nothofagus,"Panguipulli, Chile",This enchanting rainforest hotel looks as though it grew from the forest itself.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hotel-nothofagus,"Rising up out of the Chilean rainforest like some Wookiee fortress, the Hotel Nothofagus turns a stay in the rain forest into a stay IN the rainforest. Located next door to the Montana Magica Lodge, the Hotel Nothofagus is just as special. The Nothofagus is at least seven stories tall and is made almost entirely of wood. Situated in the middle of the forest, this hotel has a central atrium that reaches from the bottom of the lowest floor to a skylight on the roof. The hotel rooms are all positioned around this and have views overlooking the forest, a single ramp leading up past all the rooms. In all, there are 55 suites and multiple common dining areas. Visitors can even climb to the roof (there’s also an elevator) and get a view of the nearby Choshuenco Volcano. The building itself looks like something from the forest moon of Endor, home of the Ewoks in Star Wars. Beyond even the magic of the hotel itself, rope bridges connect it to the equally fantastical Montana Magica Lodge next door. The rainforest might be one of the most mysterious and magical environments on the planet, so it’s somewhat surprising that a hotel could make it even more so.  Location on the map is off by about 140 miles. Actual location is 39-52-09S 071-54-51W. It is right off Rt 203. You may want to use the Montana Magica Lodge next door as a reference, as it is also in Atlas Obscura (though the location of the Lodge as mapped is a little bit off, it will get you close). It is 1.7 miles west/northwest of Puerto Fuy by car."
72,Caño Cristales,"Vista Hermosa, Colombia","An explosion of natural color known as ""the river that ran away from paradise.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cano-cristales,"A unique biological wonder, Caño Cristales has been referred as the “river of five colors,” “the river that ran away from paradise,” and “the most beautiful river in the world.” For most of the year, Caño Cristales is indistinguishable from any other river: a bed of rocks covered in dull green mosses are visible below a cool, clear current. However, for a brief period of time every year, the river blossoms in a vibrant explosion of colors. During the short span between the wet and dry seasons, when the water level is just right, a unique species of plant that lines the river floor called Macarenia clavigera turns a brilliant red. It is offset by splotches of yellow and green sand, blue water, and a thousand shades in between. This only happens for a brief period between seasons. During Colombia’s wet season, the water flows too fast and deep, obscuring the bottom of the river and denying the Macarenia clavigera the sun that it needs to turn red. During the dry season, there is not enough water to support the dazzling array of life in the river. But for a few weeks from September through November, the river transforms into a veritable living rainbow. Caño Cristales is located in a remote, isolated area not easily accessible by road. Adventurous tourists can now fly into the nearby town of La Macarena. From there it is a short trip to “Serrania de la Macarena,” the national park in which Caño Cristales is located. The site was effectively closed to tourists for several years because of guerrilla activity in the region along with concerns about the impact of unregulated tourist traffic. It was reopened to visitors in 2009, and today there are several Colombian Tourist Agencies that will fly travelers to La Macarena. From there, they must make their way to the river site on horseback (or donkeyback) and by foot as part of a guided tour. Visitors are not permitted to stay overnight or cook. Swimming is permitted only in designated areas. Swimmers mustn’t wear a sunscreen as to not destroy the fragile ecosystem. For perfect photographs, check the weather forecast, because when it’s cloudy, the sun rays do not illuminate the river so the colors are not that vivid. If there was no rain for a while, the water levels drop killing the fragile plants and turning the color from bright red to brownish. Flights to La Macarena can be chartered from Villavicencio. In La Macarena, local guides should be able to take you the rest of the way to the river."
73,Las Lajas Sanctuary,"Nariño, Colombia",A dangling church built over a Colombian gorge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/las-lajas-sanctuary,"Many places of worship are built around relics and icons. However, most of them are not built in such precarious and dangerous locations as Las Lajas Sanctuary, which crosses a forested gorge on the border between Colombia  and  Ecuador. In 1754, an Amerindian woman and her daughter found themselves caught in a brutal storm. Hiding out from the weather in the gorge, the women felt a force calling to them, and to their amazement looked up and saw the image of the Virgin Mary on the rocks above. At that moment, the woman’s daughter was simultaneously cured of her inability to hear and speak. Shortly after the discovery was reported, a blind man wandered for ten years from village to village collecting donations to build a chapel around the image. When he returned to Las Lajas, he was able to see again. Both of those 18th-century miracles inspired the creation of Las Lajas Sanctuary between 1916-1949, built around the original chapel. To co-opt the original miracle, the stone image on the cliff forms the back wall of the modern sanctuary, making a gorge-spanning bridge and church combination necessary. Although the site was dedicated a minor basilica by the Catholic Church in 1954, non-religious visitors can still enjoy the dramatic setting and neo-Gothic architecture. The massive church sits 150 feet high over the river below, and its turrets contrast elegantly with the green cliffs and cascading waterfall, which are visible from the arched stone bridge.  If you visit, you can ride a teleferico instead of walking up and down to the sanctuary."
74,Tequendama Falls Museum,"San Antonio del Tequendama, Colombia",This picturesque mansion has gone from opulent ruin to nature museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tequendama-falls-museum-2,"From a mansion to a hotel to a museum, the current Tequendama Falls Museum has never lost its view of the titular gorgeous falls. Built in 1923 to serve as a successful architect’s lush mountain mansion, the decadent cliffside abode was constructed as a symbol of the lush roaring ’20s. During the 1950s the house was to be expanded to become an 18-story hotel complex, but the construction plans petered out leaving the French-styled architecture intact. After serving its time as the Hotel del Salto, the grand old house was abandoned and left to cultivate moss and tales of hauntings. Most recently the gorgeous building has been converted into the Tequendama Falls Museum, displaying wonders of the natural world to complement the organic beauty of the falls that inspired the building’s construction."
75,Guatapé,"Guatape, Colombia",The Andean town where every single building is decorated with a brightly colored frieze.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/guatape,"In Guatapé, every building is a work of art. Residents paint their houses and businesses in gorgeous bright colors, and decorate the bottom of every building with fresco-like panels called “zocalos.” It’s sometimes called the most colorful town in the world. With its steep and windy streets and bright colors, Guatapé is ridiculously photogenic, but it’s the zocalos that make it distinctive. Some friezes are simply cute: Sunflowers, doves, and sheep are popular. Other zocalos advertise businesses: bread loaves on a bakery, sewing machines outside a clothing store. The most complicated tell stories—several panels showing a journey—or commemorate history: musical instruments marking the house of a famous local musician. The zocalo tradition seems to have started about a century ago—no one seems sure when or why—but it has accelerated in recent years. Today it’s rigorously maintained because it helps make Guatapé one of the most popular vacation towns in Colombia, and a favorite day trip from Medellín, the city two hours to the west. Guatapé is cheek-by-jowl two other Colombian wonders: It sits on the shore of a weird looking reservoir that twists and turns like a gerrymandered congressional district. And Guatapé is in the shadow of El Penol, one of the largest rocks in the world, climbable on an astonishing staircase."
76,Tatacoa Desert,"Villavieja, Colombia","Unparalleled stargazing, one of Colombia's best observatories, and a swimming pool can all be found in the middle of this ancient tropical forest.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tatacoa-desert-villavieja-colombia,"If Ray Bradbury traveled to the Tatacoa Desert, his Martian Chronicles might have been shaped by this otherworldly landscape. Covering a large area around the small town of Villavieja in the department of El Huila, the Tatacoa is home to one of the most important observatories on the continent. Its expansive land is not covered with dunes, as could be expected, but rather with rocky canyons that form dry labyrinths whose red and grey colors are interrupted by the occasional green bush. Its unique landscape is explained by the misnomer that characterizes it. The truth is, the Tatacoa Desert is not a desert at all, but a dry tropical forest. Millions of years ago, it was a lush forest full of vegetation and animals. Today, earth and rock stand where trees and flowers once stood, contrasting the ever-present Andes mountains that stand in the distance. The landscape is divided into two areas: Cuzco, tinted in a deep ochre; and Los Hoyos, colored in an ashy grey. Along the main road that cuts through it is one of the most important observatories in the country. Though small, the observatory boasts thousands of visitors throughout the year, and a team of knowledgeable astronomers who share their enthusiasm. Each night, it opens its doors to visitors, who go up to its roof and spend around two hours gazing at the sky and learning everything from the history of the names of constellations to how distance is measured. The highlight of the evening is, of course, getting to use the telescopes to feel closer to the stars. As the second largest arid area in Colombia, the Tatacoa is one of the most popular places for camping and geological excursions. Most people who head to the Tatacoa plan to walk into the loneliness of the canyons and find a place to set up camp. Isolated from the noise of other people, it is here that they do the best star-gazing. Perhaps the most incongruous sight in the ochre landscape is the aquamarine swimming pool set into the dry rolling landscape. Hostels run by the few families that inhabit the area also offer beds and hammocks for those who want to see the desert without venturing out into its maze. Regardless of their preference, most travelers end up at The Pool at some point. An unlikely oasis, this man-made pool is filled with natural water springing from the desert. Beer runs aplenty, and the coolness of the water is deliciously refreshing.  The easiest way to get into the desert is by bus. Head to Neiva, the capital of the El Huila department, and ask around the central bus station for routes heading to Villavieja. You'll get on a small vehicle that will charge $3-$5 to take you into town, but you can ask to be dropped off at the desert for a little extra."

Carved out by a running stream that turns into a luminescent waterfall as it flows through the roof of the cave, La Cueva de Esplendor is a popular hiking destination. The cave is accessible by horse or foot and some tours even offer minor spelunking into the cave’s darker depths. Contact a local guide that will lead you up to Vereda La Linda, Quitasol Sector, at the northeast of Jardín – Antioquia."
78,The Volcan de Lodo El Totumo,"Santa Catalina, Colombia",The caldera of this mini-volcano has been turned into a naturally heated mud bath.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-volcan-de-lodo-el-totumo-santa-catalina-colombia,"About 45 minute northeast of Cartagena, Colombia bubbles an active volcano in which you can take a swim—that is, in a bath of naturally-heated mud. Approaching the Volcan de Lodo El Totumo (locally shortened to “El Totumo,” as “lodi” just means mud) it looks like a somewhat unremarkable, 50-foot pile of slippery earth. But climbing the stairs that lead to the summit  reveals a delightful oddity: a 15-foot diameter, lukewarm vat of grayish brown silt the consistency of a thick cream soup. Any bathers in the pool look like they’ve been dipped in chocolate. According to the local lore, El Totumo used to erupt with molten lava until a cunning local priest, who saw the bursts of flame as the Devil’s work, poured Holy Water into the fiery mouth and turned it into volcano of mud. Nowadays tourists can ascend a rickety wooden staircase and safely plunge into the muck, which contains minerals such as aluminum, calcium, and magnesium. Locals insist that the therapeutic baths bring numerous health benefits, but at very least you’ll get a pore cleansing and some especially smooth skin. The adventure only concludes, however, after (precariously) sliding down the exit stairwell into an idyllic lagoon to wash off. There, local village women will quite literally snatch off your bathing suit and use it to scrub the mud and dead skin clean off your baby-soft epidermis.  Most visits require a tour guide or, at least, a knowledgeable taxi driver. A round trip with a local guide costs $30, including price of entry."
79,Ábaco Libros y Café,"Cartagena, Colombia",A cozy bookstore and coffee shop in the heart of Cartagena's Old City.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abaco-libros-y-cafe,"This little cafe is a calm, bookish oasis within the bustling, narrow streets of Cartagena’s Old Town. Duck inside, and you’ll find walls of floor-to-ceiling books just waiting to be plucked from the shelves. Anyone can pop into the sunshine-yellow shop and hunker down with a steaming cup of Colombian coffee while flipping through the pages of hundreds of different titles. The cozy cafe has earned itself a reputation as one of the best bookstores in the city. Opened in 2002, Ábaco is a quiet spot, a place where tired tourists or laid-back locals can come to take a break from the city crowds. As it’s right in the heart of the city that inspired many of Gabriel García Márquez’s most famous works, you can expect to find his titles spread throughout the space. But of course, there are books from other local and international authors there as well."
80,Nemocón Salt Mine,"Nemocón, Colombia",Colorful lights and mirror-like brine pools create trippy illusions within the historic mine.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nemocon-salt-mine,"Bright lights bathe the walls of this massive salt mine in a surreal, colorful glow. They’re reflected within brine pools that double as mirrors, creating the dazzling illusion of a never-ending rainbow loop that beckons explorers deeper into the network of tunnels. The mine at Nemocón offers a fantastic look into the area’s salty past. It’s the second-largest salt mine in Colombia, beaten only by the magnificent nearby Salt Cathedral. Different chambers within the mine highlight various facets of the region’s lucrative salt mining history, transforming the subterranean site into an unusual, experiential museum. There’s even a small church inside that holds weekly mass on Sundays and an enormous “heart of the Virgin” constructed from salt. Between 1819 and 1968, generations of workers extracted roughly 8 million tons of salt from the mine. But even before then, locals have long been taking advantage of the wealth of minerals buried just below the mountainous surface. Archaeologists discovered ceramics dating back to the fourth century BC that show Nemocón was already a booming hotspot for salt extraction. Centuries later, the Muisca people—named the “Salt People,” for obvious reasons—brought the industry to new heights. As a result of their mines, Nemocón flourished as a high-altitude market town and salt trading hub."
81,El Peñon de Guatape,"El Peñol, Colombia","A ten-million-ton rock once worshiped by the Tahamies Indians, accessed by an astounding staircase.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-penon-de-guatape,"A massive stone rising over 650 feet out of the flat ground of Guatape, Colombia, the Piedra de Penol or El Peñon de Guatape, was once worshiped by the Tahamies Indians. By the 1900s, the massive 10-million-ton rock was seen by local farmers as a nuisance, a giant version of the rocks that the farmers regularly dug out of their fields. In 1954 a group of friends — supposedly at the urging of a local priest — climbed the rock using a series of boards wedged into a crack. These were the first people known to have climbed El Peñon de Guatape. (It is unknown whether the Tahamies had a way of ascending the stone.) Climbing the huge stone took five days, but the top of the rock revealed beautiful views and a new species of plant, Pitcairma heterophila. The rock soon became a modest tourist attraction. The rock, which is almost entirely smooth, has one long crack, the one that the climbers used in ascending it. In the crack was later wedged a 649-step masonry staircase, the only way to get to the top of the Piedra de Penol. In the 1970s, the area was dammed, and the view from the rock changed: It now overlooks a dramatic series of lakes and islands. Today, you can ascend the rock (apparently owned by a local family, though also designated by Colombia as a “national monument”) for $6 USD. There you’ll find a few religious relics and a three-story lookout tower.  Sotrasanvicente bus company has regular services to Piedra del Peñol. The two-hour trip costs 15000 Colombian pesos (or USD 4.70) as of March 2019."
82,Ciudad Perdida,"Santa Marta, Colombia",An ancient city hidden in the heart of the Sierra Nevada mountains.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ciudad-perdida,"At the end of more than 1,200 mountainside steps in the near-impenetrable tropical forest of Colombia’s Sierra Nevada lie the ruins of an ancient, abandoned city. Uncovered in the 1970s, the incredible city was one of the important archaeological discoveries of the 20th century, revealed to the world as Ciudad Perdida, or the “Lost City.” Perhaps most remarkable about Ciudad Perdida is the fact that it was built some 650 years before Machu Picchu in Peru, around the year 800. The city was also massive by ancient standards—believed to be home to some 2,000 to 8,000 inhabitants—and an impressive feat of engineering, built along a steep mountain ridge nearly a mile above sea level. A complex network of stone bridges and drainage systems has maintained the city throughout the test of time. The site is believed to have been the seat of power of the Tairona civilization, which spanned throughout the Sierra Nevada and the northern region of Colombia. It was likely abandoned in the 16th century, amid the arrival of conquistadores from Spain. European colonial powers justified their conquests by asserting that they had a legal and religious obligation to the land. Yet despite the name it has been given, the “Lost City” was never really lost to the descendants of the Tairona people that still occupy the region. Today they are known as the Wiwa, Kogi, Arhuaco, and Kankuamo peoples. Though their ancestors abandoned the city centuries ago, the Indigenous people of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta never forgot about it. When the site was “discovered” in the ’70s, Indigenous leaders quietly asserted that they knew of the city’s existence all along. In fact, they had never stopped visiting the site, which they call “Teyuna.” They had simply been careful to keep its location a secret from outsiders in order to avoid precisely what happened after looters found the city. The site is now open to visitors after being closed off for years—though only the most dedicated (and physically capable) of adventurers can visit. The site is only accessible by a 27-mile hike through treacherous terrain and an inhospitable climate."
83,Jaime Duque Park,"Tocancipá, Colombia",A little known Colombian theme park of giant curiosities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jaime-duque-park,"In a small Colombian town 30 minutes outside of Bogotá lies a giant, full-scale replica of the Taj Mahal, finished with four towering spires and a white bulb at the top. Virtually unknown to all tourists, this replica is part of Jaime Duque Park, a locally renowned agglomeration of history and culture of epic proportions. In 1983, chief pilot of Avianca Airlines Jaime Duque Grisales decided to dedicate his life to philanthropy by creating an atmosphere of education and family fun for the children of Colombia. To do so, Grisales constructed Jaime Duque Park, a 70-acre family-themed amusement park near the town of Briceno. One of Grisales’ aims was to bring the entire world to Colombia, and just that he did. In addition to the Taj Mahal, Jaime Duque Park features each of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World, including replicas of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Moscow’s Red Square, and the Egyptian Pyramids. Along with its extraordinary worldly sights, the park also offers concerts, a zoo, a conservation area, a palace of mirrors, a playground of climbable, multi-story dinosaurs, and a 1:25000 scale topographical map of Colombia. (Not to be confused with this other scale topographical map of Colombia.) The idea is to impart historical and geographical knowledge, with all proceeds going to charitable causes. Grisales connected the different attractions in the park via a series of bridges, colorfully painted outdoor walkways, and monorail-mounted bikes. The park is surrounded by a wacky, multicolored castle. Another curiosity is the monument of a human hand hoisting up a sphere, dubbed “The Hand of God.” Also found in Jaime Duque Park are battleships, stone statues, and two museums: the “Outfits of the World” fashion museum and the “Museum of Mankind in the Universe,” featuring a collection of statues explaining important moments in human evolution."
84,Cathedral of Salt,"Zipaquira, Colombia","Cathedral carved out of salt, located a mile below the earth's surface.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cathedral-of-salt-of-zipaquira,"The story of the Cathedral of Salt of Zipaquira is certainly one of persistence. The original cathedral was carved out of an active salt mine beginning in 1950. Inaugurated in 1954, the cathedral only lasted for 36 years before authorities, worried about its structural soundness, shut it down. This, however, did not deter the town of Zipaquira. In 1991, only a year after shuttering the old cathedral, work began on a new salt church some 200 feet below the old one. The current salt cathedral is roughly 75 meters long and 25 meters high, with a giant cross carved into the back wall. It can theoretically accommodate 10,000 people. Smaller naves dug out around the main chamber illustrate the life of Christ from birth to crucifixion. These naves are known as “The Stations of the Cross.” They chronicle Jesus’ last journey. The walk takes you on the journey in chronological order. Each station has a different cross carved out of rock salt and kneeling platforms. Essentially, each station is a small chapel. While clearly devoted to Catholicism, the salt “cathedral” is not in fact recognized by the Church and has no official status. This doesn’t stop the 3,000-plus visitors that come to the cathedral on most Sundays from praising the glory of both God and his mineral-ensconced home.  It takes about two to three hours to tour the cathedral. It costs about $16 to enter, and the on-site museum is not included. You need a separate ticket for the museum. Often cold inside the cathedral, so have a cardigan or jacket in the event it’s too cold for you."

Watch out for the hippos.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hacienda-napoles,"Notorious Colombian cocaine lord Pablo Escobar once lived in this sprawling estate, spending his days riding his hovercraft over its many lakes, wandering among his collection of vintage cars, and strolling through his zoo filled with hippos and exotic birds. Escobar was killed in a hail of gunfire by the Colombian police in 1993, and the Hacienda retreat became dilapidated. It has since been revived — this time as a theme park. There have been some problems, however. People have been known to sneak in — on one occasion with a backhoe — and dig up the lawn and floors in search of treasure they believe Escobar buried there. Meanwhile the four hippos Escobar imported have thrived and, in one case, escaped the confines of the estate. In 2009, a hippo named Pepe was found 100 kilometers away and was killed by the Colombian military. The group of wild hippopotamuses is now estimated at around 40. They are ruled by an alpha male nicknamed Pablo.  The hacienda is 100 miles east of Medellin on Route 60. Visitors can feed baby hippos, tour the drug baron's personal effects, and even see the Cessna that carried Escobar's first load of cocaine to the USA."
86,The Palace of the Inquisition,"Cartagena, Colombia",This elegant Colombian fortress was one of the torture headquarters for the Spanish Inquisition.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-palace-of-the-inquisition-cartagena-colombia,"The Parque de Bolivar located in the historic El Centro neighbourhood of Cartagena, is one of the ancient city’s most popular relaxation spots. Here in the leafy shade offered by the palm trees, and surrounded by cooling water fountains and tropical birds, Cartageneros meet to waste away the afternoon, playing chess and sipping coffee from the street vending tintos. It’s also home to some of the city’s most beautiful examples of Spanish Colonial architecture, one of the prettiest examples of which takes up the southern side of the square. Built in 1770, it features a grandiose entrance built in the Baroque style, long wooden balconies covered with pink bougainvillea, and an ornate cast iron fence. The stone entrance gives way to a lush courtyard filled with palm trees, detailed tile work and bright yellow plaster walls. But this 18th century palatial mansion hides a dark secret, a clue to which is to be found on the side wall around the corner to the main entrance; a small window with a simple crucifix above it bears the legend, “Ventana de la Denuncia.” Here in this tranquil setting, heretics would be denounced and led inside to meet their fate. For this beautiful building was the torture palace of the Spanish Inquisition. Under the innocent sounding name of the Court of the Holy Office, the Spanish Inquisition carried out its gruesome work until independence from Spain was won in 1812. Walking into the courtyard, the first building encountered was the secret prison called the House of Dungeons. Here, denounced heretics would await their judgement. Torture was used not as a punishment itself for heresy but to obtain a confession which the Inquisitors believed was necessary to bring the heretic back to faith. The Inquisition’s principal purpose was to defend and protect deemed threats to the Catholic Church, including blasphemy, witchcraft, and heresy. Once a confession was signed, the victim was sentenced to death in a public auto-da-fé in the courtyard outside. Today the palace is open as a museum, wherein many of the grisly tools used to extract confessions are on display. The principal method of torture was the strappado, where the victim was tied with their hands behind their back and suspended in the air whilst a series of weights and drops were added. The other infamous torture method was the rack. Often just watching another victim being stretched on the rack was all it took to obtain a confession. The museum also features other such disturbing relics as thumb screws, the head crusher, and an iron collar covered in lethal spikes. One of the largest groups targeted by the Inquisition in Cartagena were supposed witches. However the persecution of witches amounted to little more than the vilification of women through trials where victory for the accused was impossible. A notice on the wall of the museum lists the questions the accused faced, amongst them, “What evils have you caused and to whom?”; “What words do you pronounce when you fly?”; and “Why does the devil cause you blows at night?” In the over 800 trials which took place at the Palacio de la Inquisición, not a single person was ever found innocent. Walking through the museum, past the infamous witches’ ducking stool, and into the leafy courtyard beyond, you can see the Inquisitor’s guillotine still standing. Whilst the last official victim put to death by the Inquisition was in 1834, the organization actually still exists today as part of the Catholic Church. Ready to root out heretics, it is known as the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. A visit to the museum in Cartagena is a darkly disturbing one. The square outside, with its statue of Simon Bolivar, the leader of Colombia’s independence from Spain, and the building itself, are some of the ancient city’s most beautiful spots, but inside, dark artifacts from a disturbing chapter in the history of Cartagena await."

88,Swing at the End of the World,"Banos, Ecuador",A swing to dangle you off the very edge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/swing-at-the-end-of-the-world,"Deep in the Ecuadorian wilderness is a seismic monitoring station in a tree, known as Casa del Arbol. Its location is 8530.184 feet (2,600 meters) above sea level and the purpose is to observe Mt. Tungurahua, the nearby active volcano, from its precarious perch. While the treehouse itself is a sight to behold, the real attraction is the swing hanging from one of the tree’s skinny branches. With only a lonely seat belt to hold you in, the swing arcs riders out into the air over the canyon. It is unclear where the swing came from—perhaps it was set up by a whimsical seismologist. The swing is part of a small park at Casa de Arbol, complete with three swings and a small zip line. Adventurous swingers of all ages are welcome to take a ride at the end of the world, but at their own discretion. Though the swing used to be completely unmonitored, today there are guides to help you buckle in and push you as you swing—and take your photo, of course. Well, it looks like the swing hangs over a cliff, it actually hangs over a steep slope so the experience is not as thrilling as the pictures show. Tour companies will offer you a shuttle between Baños and Casa de Arbol for as low as $5 each. They leave multiple times a day and are great if you prefer the ease of shuttles and you don’t mind long lines, limited time, and huge groups of people. You can also take a bus that leaves from the center of town and goes straight to the Casa de Arbol. It costs $2.50 and you’ll be waiting in far fewer lines at the swing.  When you pull up to the Casa de Arbol, you will immediately see a tree house with a swing at the top of a steep hill. This is not the Casa de Arbol, it is actually up a little trail and on the other side of the hill. But, this is a giant swing over a huge hill, and it’s cheaper than the Casa de Arbol (by $1) and has less lines. So by all means, give it a try if you like. The actual Casa de Arbol is to the right and up a short trail. Or, hike up the path to the Bellavista Cloud Forest Viewpoint from Baños (3-hour hike, less than 1 km). Casa de Arbol costs $2 to enter, which includes all three swings and the zip line. There is a small cafe on site as well with food and drinks for purchase."
89,Laguna Quilotoa,Ecuador,A turquoise lake within a volcanic crater.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laguna-quilotoa,"When the Quilotoa volcano last erupted in 1280, it left behind a gaping caldera 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) across, which is now filled with brilliant turquoise water. The word “quilotoa” comes from the local Quechua language, a group native to the central Andes region. At an elevation of around 3,800 to 3,900 meters (12,467 to 12,795 feet), Ecuador’s Laguna Quilotoa is tucked within a rugged countryside, criss-crossed with well-worn hiking trails crawling all over the Andes mountain. The area is still home to many indigenous peoples, who make their living farming on the land much as they have for thousands of years. You’ll see their homes and patches of farmland dotting the hillsides and meet them on the trails nearby, usually wearing traditional Andean clothing and often herding sheep with a llama or two. The tiny town of Quilotoa sits nearby to the lake’s southwest, and is the best place to view the lake and begin the hike around its rim. The hike along the rim of the crater is about 7.5 km (4.7 miles), offering four or five hours of views down into the deep lake. Some of trails are suffering from erosion, especially those leading to the area at the base of the crater, where you can wander or even camp. But since the lake is only accessible by local buses and winding mountain roads, it remains less frequented than some of the region’s other spots. On some days, you might hike the caldera’s entire circumference and pass no one else—just a few wildflowers, and maybe a stray dog or sheep or, if you’re lucky, a llama or two. Quilotoa Lake is the beginning or end of a self-guided multi-day trek through the surrounding Andean mountain towns, often on poorly marked trails leading you into and out of rugged, deep canyons. The hike is an adventure and a challenge for any experiences hiker, but it’s not a backcountry trek: you can stay in local hostels and hotels every night as you hike, complete with a hot shower and a delicious meal for about $15 a night. Most people do the hike in 3-5 days, and follow the route from Latacunga > Sigchos > Isinlivi > Chugchilan > Quilotoa > Latacunga. The hike in this direction has a total of 2152 meters/7,060 feet of ascent and 1184 meters/3884 feet total of descent, across roughly 30 kilometers/18.6 miles. It costs $2 to enter the town of Quilotoa.If you just want to make a short visit, there are multiple buses each day from Latacunga to Quilotoa (1 hr 45 min). Take Zumbahua-Quilotoa-Chugchilan bus for $2.50. You will take this bus past a “Welcome to Quilotoa” sign. Don’t get off here. It’s not actually Quilotoa for a couple more kilometers. Once you approach a highway exit for Quilotoa, get off. The bus will continue left towards Chugchilan, but you will walk into town. Alternatively, you can make the three-hour direct drive from Quito. There's a wonderful hotel directly across from the entrance to the Quilotoa Lake called Hostal Chukirawa. Sitting at such a high altitude, altitude sickness prevention pills are recommended. Also, the town is foggy and cold - bring a warm jacket, and make sure that your hotel will be warm (such as a fireplace in your room and warm down blankets)."
90,Ingapirca,"Guapán, Ecuador",Ecuador's largest Incan ruins show evidence of sophisticated irrigation and diplomacy among the ancient builders.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ingapirca,"Despite being one of the most prominent pre-industrial civilizations, the Incans seemed to have a surprisingly advanced grasp of engineering, a great deal of which can be seen in Ecuador’s Ingapirca ruins. It was during the 15th century that the Incan people arrived in the area that would come to be Ingapirca, but they found they were not alone. The area was already inhabited by the native Cañari who immediately came into conflict with the Incans. While the invading force soundly trounced the native peoples, they miraculously did not wipe them out. In sharp contrast to European colonization techniques, the Inca simply allowed their community to merge with the Cañari. This new hybrid community then grew into the city now known as Ingapirca. Among the interesting remainders of the merged culture are what seem to be two separate Temples of the Sun, each one catering to the beliefs of each culture. While the ruins at Ingapirca may not hold the same surviving grandeur as some other nearby ruins, their design and ingenuity is rich in information regarding how the Incan people lived. The largest structure still standing on the site is one of the aforementioned Temples of the Sun. While it is important from an architectural standpoint, the really interesting feature is that the temple appears to have been built at such an angle that the sun would have shone directly into the doorway during the solstices. This advanced design is also on display in the startling underground aqueduct system that supplied the whole community with water. The low lying ruins of Ingapirca are still being studied and continue to supply vital information on the lost civilization that seems to have been well ahead of its time.  There is a bus from Cuenca which departs at 9 am and takes two hours to reach the ruins. There you can do a 40 minute guided tour and return on the same bus at 1 pm."
91,The Cracks - Las Grietas,"Puerto Ayora, Ecuador",These mammoth-yet-narrow crevasses in the Earth are perfect for taking an otherworldly swim.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/las-grietas,"With certain gelogical formations, you may not want to take their name literally. But “Las Grietas,” or “The Cracks,” are exactly what they sound like. On Isla Santa Cruz in the Galapagos Islands, the deep cuts in the Ecuadorian landscape forming The Cracks run hundreds of feet into the Earth, creating incredibly narrow sheer-walled canyons filled with crystal clear water. Popular with adventurers and naturalists, The Cracks provide a surreal landscape for kayaking or swimming that is hard to imagine anywhere else."
92,Intiñan Solar Museum,"San Antonio de Pichincha, Ecuador","Home of the ""true"" equator.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/intinan-solar-museum,"This museum in the foothills of the Andes Mountains features an unexpected triumvirate of physics, folklore, and culture. The Intiñan Solar Museum proudly advertises itself as the home of the “true” equator. Located a short way from the “official” equatorial monument, the museum is bisected by a line of red paint which marks what proprietors claim is the unofficial-official site of the middle of the world. GPS tests come back with mixed results, and the rocky surroundings make accurate readings difficult to obtain, but you’re close. Very close. A museum guide conducts half-hour-long tours around the premises, stopping occasionally at life-size dioramas depicting Ecuadorian daily life. The tour offers a pre-fixed sampling of native culture, peppered with the occasional interactive demonstration. The central focus of the museum is a totem pole surrounded by several stations, each designed to test the unique physical forces at work in the equatorial region. Some are clearly parlor tricks, but others are – at the very least – appreciable demonstrations of physics. Of course, if ethnographic jargon and science experiments aren’t for you, there’s the blow-dart range, pickled snakes, and “genuine shrunken head” to look forward to. The entire site can be seen in under an hour, and is appropriate for all ages."
93,Tulcán Municipal Cemetery,"Tulcan, Ecuador",This Ecuadorian cemetery is home to a jaw-dropping topiary wonderland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tulcan-municipal-cemetery,"While most cemeteries are content with their tranquil natural vistas, one caretaker at Ecuador’s Tulcán Municipal Cemetery decided that he was going to step it up a notch, and transformed the graveyard’s tall hedges into a sprawling topiary wonderland. In 1936, gardener Josè Maria Azael Franco, who worked as the caretaker of the city’s municipal cemetery, began sculpting the rows of bushes under his care into a variety of shapes and designs. There are the archways and angular geometric shapes that can be found in topiary collections around the world, but Franco also created a number of unique natural sculptures all his own. The garden features animals, angels, Incan symbols, and bulbous, iconic creatures squatting in a row. Franco passed away in 1985 and was fittingly buried at the cemetery, in the shadow of his life’s work. The topiary wonders live on to this day, cared for by Franco’s five sons, and the cemetery staff. Today the 3-acre graveyard features more than 100 creations, creating an immersive sculpted necropolis. As Franco himself put it, the cemetery is a place “so beautiful it invites one to die.”"
94,Sinchi Warmi Amazon Lodge,"Puerto Misahuallí, Ecuador",An exotic jungle hideaway run entirely by indigenous Kichwa women.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sinchi-warmi-amazon-lodge,"Surrounded by a lush tropical rainforest full of trilling birds and friendly monkeys, Ecuador’s Sinchi Warmi is not your average jungle lodge. It’s not just the series of freshwater ponds on the grounds (one of which holds a 6-foot-long endangered Amazon fish that comes to the surface when you clap) that makes it unique. Or the soaring bamboo lookout that gazes over the humid forests. It’s the story behind Sinchi Warmi, which is run entirely by indigenous Kichwa women. The Amazon lodge was the brainchild of a group of women artisans who dreamed of running their own business to provide employment for their children and marginalized community. It was not an easy task. They fought hard against their macho peers who said the project would never amount to anything. It took 10 years to get the lodge off the ground, during which six of the women were abandoned by their husbands who were not pleased by their wives’ newfound independence. But they pushed on, learning how to create Facebook profiles and manage booking websites. And now, after a decade, the women have achieved their dream: a picture-perfect lodge that supports the community of San Pedro. Guests and passing visitors can enjoy a traditional guayusa tea ceremony, meet Saru the local monkey or one of her friends, or take a break in a breezy hammock overlooking the forest. It’s a place to try traditional maita de tilapia, a fish native to the Amazon, learn Kichwa dream-sharing traditions and support a project that has survived against all odds."
95,Middle of the World,"San Antonio de Pichincha, Ecuador",An elaborate shrine dedicated to the four corners of the world unfortunately misses its mark.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/middle-of-the-world,"The dramatic monument commemorating the 1739 French Geodesic Mission that surveyed the equator, established the circumference of the earth and the length of the meter, proved so ornate that relocating it 240 meters to the correct location would be more trouble than it’s worth. In 1936, geographer Luis Tufiño sponsored a 10-meter monument at the equator to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the French Geodesic Mission which charted the equator and measured the shape of the earth. The design of the monument seems inspired by a fictitious Incan pyramid imagined by the painter Frederic Edwin Church in the painting “Cayambe.” A larger monument of the same design was built on the site in 1979. A broad avenue lined with heroic busts of the members of the 1739 Geodesic Mission leads to a 30-meter tower topped by a 5-ton bronze globe balanced sideways on the line of the equator. The interior of the monument houses a small museum of Ecuadorian ethnography leading to an upper observation deck looking down on the valley and the little village of tourist attractions around the monument. The main attraction, however, is the painted line on the pavement marked Latitude 0° 0’ 0”, where all visitors take a photo straddling both hemispheres. Sadly, the painted line and the location of the monument are misplaced. The original calculations by Tufiño to establish the equator have been proven incorrect by more accurate modern technology and the actual equator line runs about 240 meters north of the monument. In addition, the French Geodesic Mission it commemorates did not actually visit this site on their survey expedition. Still, the monument remains a curious shrine to an imaginary line which brought Ecuador its name and worldwide fame."

No slouch in the size department, Chimborazo is actually an inactive volcano that stands at 20,565 feet. It makes up for the 9,000-foot difference between itself and Everest with the equatorial bulge. Only one degree south of the equator, the earth is thicker nearer the equator and makes up the extra difference for Chimborazo. When all is said and done, Chimborazo measures 7,113 feet farther from the center of the earth than Mount Everest and is a whopping 3,967 miles from earth’s center."
97,Tiputini Biodiversity Station,Ecuador,This research hub in the Amazon Rainforest is perched amid one of the world's most biologically diverse landscapes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tiputini-biodiversity-station,"Vibrant birds and chatty primates flit between the snarls of branches that form the higher canopies. Insects buzz through the air, while spiders weave their tapestries among branches or burrow beneath the soil. Larger animals, like giant anteaters, capybara, and tapir roam the ground. Even predators like the elusive black jaguar lurk just out of sight. From its perch along the shores of the Tiputini River, the Tiputini Biodiversity Station offers researchers an unparalleled place to conduct their studies of the Ecuadorian Amazon Rainforest. It’s located inside one of the most biologically diverse environments in South America, if not the world. The biodiversity station’s remote location, coupled with the lack of local large mammal hunting, make it a prime spot to view animals that typically can’t be seen elsewhere. An immeasurable number of creatures live in the area surrounding the station, though most will only become visible long enough for viewers to snag a fleeting glimpse. The nearby water also boasts a high volume of fascinating fauna. Pink dolphins, black caiman, stingray, and piranhas are but a small sample of the animals that live within the river, which streaks through the landscape like a muddy stain. The plants, too, are their own trove of diverse treasures. The Yasuni Biosphere Reserve has more than 1,500 species of flora per hectare. Many of the plants are medicinal, and have been used by indigenous healers and shamans for thousands of years. The station was established within the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve in 1995, as a joint project between the Universidad de San Francisco de Quito and Boston University.  Though it is primarily used by researchers, it also serves as an education center.  Groups of students or other visitors are welcome to stay at the remote station—in fact, 85 percent of its visitors are organized student groups. Those who do make the trek into the rainforest will find one main two-story research lab, a handful of secondary labs, and even a smattering of cabins containing bunk beds."
98,Cueva de los Tayos,Ecuador,"This cave system allegedly holds the ""metallic library"" of a lost ancient civilization.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cueva-de-los-tayos,"In 1976, a major expedition entered the Cueva de los Tayos in search of artificial tunnels, lost gold, strange sculptures, and a “metallic library,” supposedly left by a lost civilization aided by extraterrestrials. Among the group was the astronaut Neil Armstrong. For as long as anyone can remember, the indigenous Shuar people of Ecuador have been entering a vast cave system on the jungle-covered eastern foothills of the Andes. They descend, using ladders made of vines, through one of three vertiginous entrances, the largest of which is a 213-foot-deep (65-meter) shaft that leads into a network of tunnels and chambers stretching, as far as we know, for at least 2.85 miles. The largest chamber measures 295 feet by 787 feet. For the Shuar, these caves have long been a center for spiritual and ceremonial practices, home to powerful spirits as well as tarantulas, scorpions, spiders, and rainbow boas. They are also home to nocturnal oilbirds, known locally as tayos, hence the name of the cave. The tayos are a favored food of the Shuar, another reason why they brave the depths of the cave system. In their role as guardians of the cave system, the Shuar had been left in relative peace over the last century or two, apart from an occasional gold prospector snooping around in the 1950s and ‘60s. Until, that was, a certain Erich von Däniken decided to get involved. The Swiss author captured the global imagination in 1968 with the publication of his book Chariots of the Gods?, which is in large part responsible for the current plague of ancient astronaut theories and all that malarkey. Then, three years later, he published The Gold of the Gods, unleashing a little-known theory about the Cueva de los Tayos upon his eager readership. In The Gold of the Gods, von Däniken recounted the claims of János Juan Móricz, an explorer who claimed to have entered the caves in 1969. Inside the cave, he asserted, he had discovered a treasure trove of gold, strange artifacts and sculptures, and a “metallic library” containing lost information preserved on metal tablets. And the caves themselves were surely artificial, he claimed, created by some advanced intelligence now lost to history. This was red meat for von Däniken, of course, and tied in very nicely with his spate of lucrative books promoting his theories of lost civilizations, ancient astronauts, and the like (or, as Carl Sagan put it, von Däniken’s theory that “our ancestors were dummies”). It also inspired the first major scientific expedition to Cueva de los Tayos. The 1976 expedition was led by Stan Hall, a Scottish civil engineer who had read von Däniken’s work. It quickly grew to become one of the largest cave expeditions of its time, with more than 100 people involved. These included British and Ecuadorian government officials, leading scientists and speleologists, British special forces, professional cavers, and none other than astronaut Neil Armstrong, who served as the expedition’s Honorary President. The expedition was a success, at least in its less fanciful ambitions. The extensive network of caves was mapped far more thoroughly than ever before. Zoological and botanical findings were recorded. And archaeological discoveries were made. But no gold was found, no otherworldly artifacts discovered, and there was no sign of a metallic library. The cave system, too, appeared to be the result of natural forces rather than any kind of advanced engineering. Interest in the Cueva de los Tayos never again reached the heights of the 1976 expedition, but numerous research expeditions have since taken place. One of the more recent expeditions was that of Josh Gates and his team for the fourth season of the television series Expedition Unknown. Gates entered the cave system with Shuar guides and Eileen Hall, the daughter of the late Stan Hall from the 1976 expedition. And while expeditions such as these have resulted in fascinating zoological and geological discoveries, there’s still no sign of gold, aliens, or a library.  The Cueva de los Tayos is located in the rainforest about 23 miles southeast of the town of Santiago de Mendez in southeastern Ecuador, not far from the border with Peru. It is within the Sindical Center Coangos, and is therefore on Shuar territory. Access to the cave must be arranged with local Shuar authorities. Expeditions to the cave can be carried out on foot, by boat, or a combination of the two. It is sometimes also possible to go via helicopter from the town of Macas, some 50 miles north of the caves."
99,Isla de la Plata,Ecuador,This small uninhabited island offers Galapagos-like biodiversity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/isla-de-la-plata-ecuador,"The Galapagos Islands are an obvious destination for any explorer who’s wild about biological diversity. But for those who can’t afford to visit the famed epicenter of evolution evidence, there’s a smaller, cheaper option. Isla de la Plata (Silver Island) is an uninhabited island that’s part of Parque Nacional Machalilla. It’s about 25 miles off Puerto Lopez, Ecuador. The root of its name is uncertain: It may refer to the treasure allegedly buried there by Sir Francis Drake, or it may refer to the reservoir of guano (bird droppings) that glints in the sun from atop the cliffs. The two-square mile island is a hotbed of biological diversity. It’s packed with a plethora of birds, including different types of boobies, frigatebirds, tropicbirds, albatrosses, and pelicans. Honorable non-avian mentions include its many lizards, iguanas, turtles, crabs, and sea lions, all of which can be seen with relative ease. Upon setting foot on the island, most people experience the feeling of stepping onto another world, as curiosity prompts blue-footed boobies to wobble toward the human visitors. At arm’s length, the birds simply stare at people or dismissively pass by them. And just to dispel any doubt, no, “blue booby” is not a misnomer—their feet (and beak) are indeed blue! If you visit between June and September, you’ll likely see whales and dolphins popping out of the waves that ripple across the ocean separating the island from the mainland. Snorkeling will let you catch a peek of the fish and turtles that frequent the island’s coastal waters. GPS coordinates lead to the tourist information center. There are walking trails throughout the island."
100,Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús,"Quito, Ecuador",It took 160 years to complete the most ornate church in Ecuador.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iglesia-de-la-compania-de-jesus,"Jesuit architects began work on the Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús in 1605. The church was finally completed 160 years later, and is now considered one of the finest examples of Spanish Baroque architecture in South America. During the 16th century, religious orders were busy building churches in the newly founded city of Quito. The colonial city council had granted plots to the Franciscans, the Augustinians, and the Dominicans, among others. And when the first Jesuit priests arrived in Quito in 1586, they too sought land in the city on which to build a church. The Jesuits were granted a plot just off Plaza Grande in the heart of the city, and the first stone was laid in 1605 by the Italian Jesuit priest Nicolás Duran Mastrilli. And so began a 160-year construction project that would involve numerous architects, different architectural styles, and the work of some of Quito’s greatest artisans. Upon its completion in 1765, the Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús had incorporated four architectural styles. The predominant architectural style is Baroque, and the church has no shortage of the exuberance, fine detail, and grandeur associated with that particular style. Moorish, or Mudejar, architecture, meanwhile, is clear to see in the geometrical figures on the church’s pillars. Parts of the interior reveal the stucco decoration of the Churrigueresque style, while the Chapel of Saint Mariana de Jesús is very much Neoclassical. Today the church is widely regarded as the finest church in Quito and one of the most ornate religious buildings in Ecuador. The large central nave is decorated almost completely with gold leaf, gilded plaster, and wooden carvings, above which are two green and gold domes in the vaulted ceiling. Among all the architectural flourishes are 44 paintings and 56 sculptures by artists of the Quito School. The most famous of these works are the “16 Prophets” by Nicolás Javier de Goríbar, sculptures of the Holy Trinity by Bernardo de Legarda, and paintings depicting Hell and the Final Judgment at each side of the main entrance. Other notable elements include symbols of the Sun on the main door to the church and the ceiling. The inclusion of the Sun symbol was a nod to the Inca civilization (and the Sun God Inti), possibly included as a way of encouraging the indigenous population to enter the church. This syncretism is also displayed in other parts of the church. If you look carefully, you’ll see Ecuadorian plants and indigenous faces included within the decorations on the walls and pillars.  The Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús is located along García Moreno and Sucre in the historic center of Quito, one block to the southwest of Plaza Grande. Visiting hours for tourists are from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday to Thursday, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday and 12:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday.

101,Agua Blanca Community,"Agua Blanca, Ecuador",The remains of an ancient settlement in one of the oldest archeological sites in South America.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/agua-blanca-community,"Agua Blanca is a settlement in one of the oldest archeological sites in South America, in the heart of the Machalilla National Park in Ecuador, on the remains of the Manteño culture’s pre-Columbian period. It is a mix of natural wonder, culture, and archeology. The ancient Agua Blanca Community was among the last coastal community in Ecuador to succumb to colonization. As a result, many traditions and archeological findings are preserved. A set of temples, houses, and plazas typical of the Manteño culture, as well as archeological items and skulls, can be found on this site dating from 1500 BC. The community has a small church and a museum in the center of the village, and the church is wonderfully painted in bright colors. A small artisan’s market also sells rare Spondylus shell and tagua accessories, as well as local cuisine snacks. A natural sulfur lagoon can also be found on the site and is accessible by tourists. It is said the mineral waters and muds in the lagoon can help the skin and wellbeing of visitors. Howling monkeys, butterflies, hummingbirds, and local flora like ceibo trees can also be seen here, and a hiking tour to local haciendas is included as part of the visit experience. English-speaking guides can be requested. The Agua Blanca Community is located inside the Machalilla National Park in the province of Manabi, Ecuador. It is located 12 Km north of Puerto Lopez, nearly 5 Km from the Jipijapa - Puerto Lopez highway.A bus can take you to the front gate from Puerto Lopez for US$0.40, while a moto taxi may charge you between US$4-US$5 depending on whether they drop you off at the museum 5km from the gate. An additional $5 fee is required to enter the site, and tips are welcome. Swimwear, towel, and a camera are suggested."
102,Teleférico Quito,"Quito, Ecuador",The gondolas let you glimpse a bird's-eye view of one of the world's highest capital cities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/teleferico-quito,"At more than 9,000 feet above sea level, Quito, Ecuador is already the world’s second-highest capital city. But altitude junkies who want to go the extra mile (almost literally!) can head to the edge of the city, to the Teleférico. Step into one of this gondola’s six-person cars and you’ll be swept up another 3,600 feet along the eastern slope of the Pichincha Volcano. The base of the Teleférico—also known as the TelefériQo—was originally meant to be a commercial hub, surrounded by malls and restaurants. Most of these plans fell through, but the gondola itself is popular with both tourists and locals, who get a discounted rate. The walls of the cars are transparent, and as they zoom along, riders look down at hillsides dotted with wildflowers and grazing cows or watch their fellow daredevils enjoying themselves at Vulqano Park. A panoramic view of Quito unfolds farther below. Once the gondola has reached the top, it’s possible to climb even higher: a hiking path leads up to the volcano’s summit, and other Andean mountains rise up all around. Or you can take a break at the snack shop, which offers food, coffee, restrooms, and flavored oxygen—another kind of high.  The Teleférico's base is a 15-minute walk from the nearest bus stop. It's also accessible via car or taxi. Keep your ticket, as you'll need it to get back down. Those who aren't used to being up so high can suffer from altitude sickness—and even if you've been in Quito for a while, this is a major change. To mitigate the effects, move slowly and drink a lot of water."
103,Vilcabamba,"Vilcabamba, Ecuador","In this pristine Ecuadorian hippie town, residents remain active well into their eighties and nineties.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vilcabamba,"Snuggled in the hills of the Andean slopes of Ecuador lies a small oasis of vitality. Vilcabamba, known as the “Valley of Longevity,” enjoyed a spell in the limelight during the 1970s, when reports emerged that an astonishing number of centenarians lived in the area, giving the small town its nickname. According to the research conducted in 1971 by Dr Alexander Leaf of Harvard Medical School, there were nine residents who claimed to be over 100 years old, in a population of 819, a stunning figure. As this report circulated, researchers and tourists alike flocked to the village to understand the secret of their longevity. But this legend was punctured a few years later, when Dr Leaf himself went back to do some followup research and discovered that inaccurate self-reporting and misleading birth certificates had contributed to errors in the previous findings. There were no centenarians, and the oldest man was 96 years old. Despite the bursting of this bubble, the town continues to be known for its quality of life and its New Age, hippie-esque, health conscious vibe. Ever since the period of the Incas, the pristine mountain region has been a sought-after location for rest and recuperation. The royals would travel to the valley and recharge their batteries with the fresh water and mountain air, mineral-rich food, and a consistent spring-like climate. The combination of these factors are thought to help people live full and active lives well into their eighties and nineties. The simple pastoral life includes a lot of outdoor activity and exercise, and there are plenty of paths and hikes leading into the surrounding mountains. The scenes around town provide you with glimpses of able elderly people still working or enjoying their retirement, youthful hippies seeking an alternative lifestyle, and foreigners who have settled there after their retirement or fled there for a brief break from the stressful world outside. Because of the town’s reputation and the healthy lifestyle of the locals, vegan and vegetarian restaurants make up a large portion of the town’s businesses. Many newer structures have been built and the older ones modernized, but the town continues to hold on to its roots—letting nature flourish in and around the village, as well as within the bodies of many of its residents."
104,Bodie Creek Suspension Bridge,Falkland Islands,An abandoned suspension bridge on the Falkland Islands is crumbling into the water.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bodie-creek-suspension-bridge,"When this structure was first constructed, it was touted as the world’s southernmost suspension bridge. Now abandoned and unsafe to cross, it’s at risk of falling into the very creek it was built to cross. The Bodie Creek Suspension Bridge is just south of the Goose Green settlement on East Falkland. It was constructed in 1925 to make it easier for sheep farmers to shepherd their flocks to the village’s newly built shearing sheds. As there are no ironworks or engineering factories on the Falkland Islands, the bridge was ordered from David Rowell & Co of London at a cost of £2,281. The kit was then shipped from London to the Falkland Islands on the SS Ballena. Due to the Falkland Islands being so remote and having limited resources, it was mainly up to the local sheep farmers, plus a stonemason and engineer, to put the bridge together. During construction, the workforce only had access to two machines to help them: a cement mixer and a stone breaker. Everything else was done by hand. Construction started in 1924 and was completed in 1925. Once it opened, the locals would drive their carts and later, their Land Rovers, across the overpass. And of course, the local sheep farmers who helped build the bridge would also use it to move their animals. But sadly, the bridge’s infrastructure weakened over time. It closed in 1997 due to safety concerns. The dirt roads once connected to either end of the structure are now long gone. The support beams have started to fall into the underlying water, making it look like an out-of-place bridge to nowhere.  You can view the bridge at any time. The nearest village, Goose Green, is a roughly 10-minute drive away. The route is signposted, so it's also suitable as a two-hour roundtrip walk."
105,Bertha's Beach,Falkland Islands,This remote stretch of sand is a penguin lover's paradise.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/berthas-beach,"This beach is named after the Bertha ship that wrecked on the beach, though the wreck is no longer visible. But a lost shipwreck isn’t its only draw. If you’re a keen birder, this stretch of sand is a must-see. Bertha’s Beach is classed as both an important bird area and a Ramsar Wetland site because of the various birds that call it home. Head to the beach, and you’ll likely spot penguins waddling around. A number of Gentoo penguin colonies live on the beach year-round. For about half the year, it’s also frequented by Magellanic penguins. In addition to the penguins, the beach is also home to South American terns, ruddy-headed geese, the endemic Falkland flightless steamer duck, and various other birds. Although not as reliable as the bird watching, you can often see both Commerson’s and Peale’s dolphins playing and hunting in the surf of the beach. Sometimes the dolphins come close to the shore and essentially surf in the shallows to catch fish before returning to the waves. Although rare, if you are very lucky, you may be able to see beaked, toothed, baleen, or killer whales swimming by. Additionally, various types of sea lions and seals often come ashore to bask on the beach. The majority of them are harmless, but the leopard seals have been known to bite people who get too close to them. The flora is just as interesting as the fauna. The beach is also home to over 80 types of plants, with five of them being endemic and the Dusen’s moonwort ferns being very rare.  Bertha's Beach is located on the Fitzroy Farm on the East Falkland island but express permission is given to visitors to access the beach via the various signs at the carpark. Be respectful of the animals: do not harass or attempt to approach them. Remember that this is their beach!"
106,The Shipwreck of Lady Elizabeth,Falkland Islands,This haunting ghost ship stands beached in the waters off the coast of the Falkland Islands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-shipwreck-of-lady-elizabeth-falkland-islands,"Called the “Lady Liz” by locals, this three-masted rusted iron barque drifted into Whalebone Cove in February, 1936, and has remained ever since. The Lady Elizabeth was launched from Sunderland, England, on June 4th, 1879. She was built to replace a prior Lady Elizabeth, which had sunk off the coast of Western Australia in 1878. The second Lady Elizabeth voyaged all around the world, hauling cargo successfully for over 30 years. On December 4th, 1912, the Lady Elizabeth left Vancouver with a shipment of lumber. She was headed for Mozambique. While sailing around Cape Horn, she encountered strong gales. The ship was damaged, much of the cargo lost, and four men were thrown overboard. While limping into Berkley Sound on her way to Port Stanley for repairs, she suffered extensive damage to her hull when she struck Uranae Rock, off Volunteer Point. Once reaching Port Stanley, she was declared unseaworthy and bought by the Falkland Island Company to be used as a floating timber warehouse. On February 17, 1936, a fierce storm battered the Lady Elizabeth. She broke free of her moorings, drifted into Whalebone Cove and was beached on a shallow sandbar. Over the years, she has been vandalized by opportunists who have stolen her wood and other valuables. Today, she still stands, corroded but proud. Her current owner, the Crown Receiver of Wrecks, has attempted to convert her into a floating museum, but the project has stalled due to lack of funding."
107,Christ Church Cathedral,"Stanley, Falkland Islands",The southernmost Anglican cathedral in the world has whale bones standing in its yard.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/christ-church-cathedral,"Consecrated in the town of Stanley in 1892, Christ Church Cathedral is one of the crown jewels of the Falkland Islands. The church that graces the capital also graces the nation’s paper money, and although it is one of the smallest Anglican churches in the world and simple by cathedral standards, it is one of the most beautiful buildings in the Falklands. Its modest frame and steeple may not be ornate or grandiose, but it does have some treasures inside, and an unusual monument in the yard. In 1933, an arch made of the giant jaw bones of two blue whales was erected in front of the church to observe a century of British rule. The British had claimed the territory in 1785, regardless of the French already laying claim a year earlier. Spain then bought it from the French, and evicted the Brits, only to decide they preferred what is now Argentina. In 1820, the shiny new nation of Argentina absorbed the islands, but in 1833, the British made a comeback, and the Falklands have been theirs ever since. The jaw bones were brought to Stanley from the South Shetland Islands in 1922, and used to create the arch that stands out against the church’s humble backdrop today. Inside the church, the interior is also basic; wooden pews, stained glass, and 55 hassocks sewn and designed to represent different aspects of the Falklands by local parishioners. However, among the normal odds and ends one finds in a small town church, there’s one item of particular interest–the Shackleton Banner. Sir Ernest Shackleton was an explorer who was invited by the British to come to the Falklands and make some economic proposals, and his advice was heeded with great success. Shackleton was a member of the Order of the Garter, the most prominent order of chivalry bestowed. Banners of the order are required to hang in St. George’s Chapel in Windsor, but Shackleton’s son bequeathed it to the Christ Church Cathedral. It’s the only banner of its kind on the entire continent of South America."
108,Boot Hill,Falkland Islands,An ever-growing field of footwear invites legends and more shoes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boot-hill,"While “Assorted Footwear Hill” doesn’t really have the same charm as “Boot Hill”, it would be a more accurate description of the assorted shoes on stakes that litter this Falkland Islands hilltop. This isn’t the only place empty shoes have mysteriously accumulated. Across the U.S., fanciful shoe trees have periodically popped up here and there. In the case of the shoes on the Danube, the empty vessels were left there to honor thousands executed on the riverbank during World War II. Boot Hill has a couple of explanations, but as it often is with these kinds of communal effort of weirdness, nothing is known for sure. Located between Port Stanley and the local airport, one of the explanations for Boot Hill is that retired employees posted at the airport leave a work boot behind on the hill as they move on. Another, slightly darker legend offers a story of a local man whose leg was blown off by forgotten landmines left by a tussle over the islands between the UK and Argentina. The injured man impaled his boot on the hill, and soon the staked boot was joined by a continuously growing number of sympathy shoes. Perhaps the most likable legend surrounding the hill’s collection of assorted footwear is that if you leave your own behind as your visit to the islands come to a close, you are meant to return. Off Darwin Rd, few miles outside of Stanley. Pay mind to the signs denoting areas with mines."
109,Falkland Islands Totem Pole,"Stanley, Falkland Islands",Where British troops serving on the remote islands paid tribute to their faraway hometowns.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-falkland-islands-totem-pole,"Head to the Falkland Islands, and there’s a chance you may see a small reminder of your hometown, no matter how far away it is, thanks to the various travelers who’ve left their marks on this unusual “totem pole.” This quirky roadside attraction has been dubbed the Falkland Islands Totem Pole. It was initially started by British troops deployed to the Falklands to protect the islands from further aggression after the end of the Falklands War in 1982. The deployed troops made mockup signs with the name of their hometowns and their distances from the Falklands. They then attached their handiwork to an old power line pylon, forming an unusual, unplanned piece of outsider art. It’s a tradition that still carries on today. Since the soldiers first tacked their hometown tributes to the tower, a number of visitors to the islands have added their own contributions. Tourists on holiday and scientists passing through on their way to various Antarctic research sites have also added signs for their hometowns.  The pole is next to the road, so you can stop to view it at any time."
110,Argentine Military Cemetery,Falkland Islands,A hilltop collection of crosses remembering the hundreds of Argentine troops who fell during the Falklands War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/argentine-military-cemetery,"Simple white crosses stand in neat rows atop this somber sliver of land. They mark the eternal resting places of more than 200 Argentine soldiers killed during the Falklands War. After the British reclaimed the Falkland Islands on June 14, 1982, many of the bodies of the fallen Argentine were left on the Falkland Islands in temporary graves rather than repatriated back to Argentina. Buenos Aires refused to let the British return the remains of these troops back to Argentina, claiming that they were already laid to rest in their homeland. Since they were unable to ship the dead soldiers back to Argentina, the British commissioned the creation of the Argentine Military Cemetery in December 1982. Upon completion of the Military Cemetery, the British gave the fallen Argentine troops a Christian burial with full military honors. The British Armed Forces did their best to identify the remains of each individual member of the Argentine military buried at the cemetery and mark their graves accordingly. That said, a small number of the graves display the message “Argentine Soldier Known Only By God” due to them being unidentified. The location of the Argentine Military Cemetery on the Falkland Islands in at the top of a hill. The hill acts as a natural barrier that protects the location from the harsh winds the Falkland Islands are exposed to. When walking up the hill to the cemetery, the lack of wind instantly becomes apparent, offering a calm final resting place for the 237 troops located there.  The cemetery is open 24 hours a day. Please remember your surroundings and act respectfully while visiting the graveyard."
111,Blue Beach Military Cemetery,Falkland Islands,A small cemetery remembers the British troops who fell during the Falklands War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blue-beach-military-cemetery,"During the Falklands War, many of the British troops who died in battle were placed in temporary graves until the war was won and a permanent cemetery could be established. At the time, the tradition was that British troops killed in action would be buried as close as possible to the location where they fell, and a memorial would be constructed to remember them as soon as it was safe. When the Falklands War was over, many of the families of the British troops who lost their lives decided they would prefer their loved ones be transported back to the United Kingdom. The landing ship Sir Bedivere was tasked with the repatriation and returned 63 British troops and one civilian contractor back to the U.K. in November 1982. The British government then commissioned the construction of the Blue Beach Military Cemetery on the very location that 3 Commando Brigade chose as their headquarters after the initial beach landings at San Carlos during the war. The cemetery was completed and unveiled on April 10, 1983, along with a memorial. The site initially served as the final resting place for 13 of the British troops who fell during the conflict. Sadly, two years after the war ended, Army Air Corps Captain John Belt lost his life in an accidental helicopter crash in the Falkland Islands. His family chose to have him buried at Blue Beach Military Cemetery and it has been the final resting place of the 14 troops ever since."
112,"Lieutenant Colonel ""H"" Jones Memorial","Darwin, Falkland Islands",It marks the spot where the high-ranking British officer died during the Falklands War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lieutenant-colonel-h-jones-memorial,"Lieutenant Colonel Herbert “H” Jones is one of the highest-ranking British officers to be killed in action in recent times. He was the officer in command of the 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment during their deployment in support of the Falklands War, and led his troops in the Battle of Goose Green. While leading an attack in a heavily entrenched Argentinian position, his section quickly became pinned down by heavy machine guns and automatic rifle fire. In a desperate bid to save his men, he decided to lead a charge against the nearest Argentinian position and was unfortunately killed during the process. Various accounts of the battle agree that the charge Jones led helped turn the tide of the battle of Goose Green and hasten the British victory. Shortly after he was hit, the Argentinian unit in the battle surrendered, helping to drastically lower the number of troops injured or killed on both sides as well as secure the release of 112 civilians that the Argentinian troops had imprisoned. After he fell, Jones was initially placed in a war grave at Ajax Bay on May 30, 1982. After the war ended, his body was then exhumed and reburied at the British Cemetery of Blue Beach at San Carlos. This memorial marks the spot where he fell during the battle. Jones was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest possible award for British troops in the British honor system.  You can reach the memorial via a short walk from Mount Pleasant – Darwin road."
113,Shell Beach,Guyana,"A nesting ground for four of the world’s seven marine turtle species, most of which are endangered.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shell-beach-turtles,"Shell Beach stretches for about 90 miles along the Atlantic coast of Guyana, not far from the border with Venezuela. From March to August, four species of marine turtles, all of which are either vulnerable or endangered, come ashore to lay their eggs. Of the world’s seven remaining species of marine turtles, almost all have been pushed to endangered levels. Hunting, habitat loss, plastics pollution, climate change, and accidentally being caught in fishing nets continue to threaten the existence of these large and long-living creatures. Shell Beach, named after the shells that form its 90-mile extent, is a vital nesting ground for four of these marine turtle species. This in itself is a rare occurrence, as most of the world’s sea turtle nesting sites are visited by only one or two species. Each year between March and August, female leatherback, olive ridley, hawksbill, and green turtles come ashore to lay their eggs. Under cover of night, the females make their way up the beach, often to the very spot at which they were born. Each female then digs an egg chamber and fills it with around 100 eggs before covering it with sand. The hatchlings emerge around 45 to 70 days later, making a mad dash for the water. Between 15 and 40 years later, many of these same hatchlings will return to Shell Beach to continue the cycle. This cycle, however, is a fragile thing. Thankfully, the turtles and the wider marine environment of Shell Beach have a protector. In 2000, Dr. Peter Pritchard and Romeo De Freitas founded the Guyana Marine Turtle Conservation Society, a non-governmental conservation program that has worked tirelessly to protect the turtles of Shell Beach from hunting, habitat loss (by erosion and human activity), commercial fishing, and the pollution of the oceans. Trying to monitor a 90 mile stretch of beach, especially at night, is no simple task. But thanks to the work of the Guyana Marine Turtle Conservation Society, visitors can still make the long trip to Shell Beach to watch the turtles coming ashore and maybe catch the hatchlings as they make their first journey to the sea. Which, for nature lovers, is one of the world’s most spectacular events.  Shell Beach is located in the Barima-Waini Region in the northwest of Guyana. While the entire extend goes by the name Shell Beach, it consists of nine beach sections, most of which are unpopulated (the largest permanent human populations are found at Almond Beach and Gwennie Beach, each with about 150 to 180 residents). It can be quite a mission to visit Shell Beach, so most people arrange a multi-day tour from the Guyanese capital of Georgetown. These tours typically offer basic overnight accommodation, which normally involves camping on or near the beach, which is ideal for the nightly excursions to see the turtles. Remember that between March and August is the time to visit. Do not harass or in any way interact with the turtles. Maintain a safe distance from both the turtles and their nests."
114,Kaieteur Falls,Guyana,"The world's widest single drop waterfall, and the two men who legend says went over its edge in a boat.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaieteur-falls,"Ever wonder what it might feel like to be the last humans on earth, witnessing a river plummet off the edge of the world? It might look something like Kaieteur Falls. Deep within Guyana’s region of the Amazon Forest lies Kaieteur National Park, home to a gargantuan cataract sharing the park’s name. Rivaled by few in the world when taken into account its combined height and the sheer volume of water from the Potaru River flowing over its precipice at any given moment, Kaieteur Falls further distances itself from the crowd of most spectacular waterfalls in the world for its remoteness. Surrounded by pristine rainforest, simply reaching this wonder requires hiring a tour company that will charter a plane in order to even reach a trekking point that accesses the falls. A pair of similar legends further contribute to the Falls’ mystique. According to local Patoma Indian lore, chief Kai saved his people by paddling over the precipice in an act of self-sacrifice to the spirit Makonaima. The second version is slightly less altruistic, as relayed by geologist Charles Barrington Brown in his account from when he “discovered” the waterfall on an expedition in 1870; Brown was told by Amerindians that a despised old man was put in a boat by relatives eager to be rid of him, and unceremoniously pushed into the current, which lent the falls their current name translating to “old-man-fall.” So, should you find yourself in close enough proximity to Kaieteur Falls to become mesmerized by its waters, remember the two men who are said to have actually gone over them. You must hire a private tour company to charter a flight to fly into the small Kaieteur airstrip in the middle of the jungle. Several tour companies run flights to Kaieteur Falls several times per week. Depending on the weather and the season, only one or two operators may fly a day. Book ahead to ensure your spot on a flight, as most planes will hold a maximum of 8-10 passengers. The flight from Ogle Airport in Georgetown is approximately 90 minutes one way. Wear sturdy shoes to visit Kaieteur Falls, as there are uneven pathways to navigate between the three different lookouts. You will spend around 2 hours on the ground before flying back to Georgetown or onwards to another destination depending on your day tour package."
115,St. George's Cathedral,"Georgetown, Guyana",Georgetown’s most impressive building is also one of the tallest wooden churches in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-georges-cathedral,"St. George’s Cathedral isn’t all that lofty as churches go, but at 143-feet-tall and made entirely from wood—apart from its foundations—it ranks amongst the tallest wooden churches in the world. Apart from its notable wooden construction, St. George’s Cathedral is an important and much-loved landmark in the Guyanese capital of Georgetown for two reasons: most locals would agree that it’s the most impressive building in the capital, and anyone with an eye for history can see how the cathedral is a window into Guyana’s colonial past. With the continued expansion of the Anglican Church in what was then British Guiana, a series of churches were built in Georgetown. The first St. George’s Church was built in 1810, but was soon deemed too small for the congregation. A second church was completed in 1842 but, as the Archdeacon Jones later stated, it “began its existence with a broken back.” The clay-brick building was a structural disaster and was dismantled in 1877. For the third attempt, the renowned English architect Arthur Blomfield was called upon to draw up the plans, initially for a stone building with a central tower and two western towers. The committee in charge of the new church argued against the use of stone, however, both because of its expense and its weight. Instead, they emphasized that “woods of the country and no others were to be used.” So Blomfield kept largely to his original plans, including the central tower, the Latin cross formation of nave and septs, and his use of the Gothic style of architecture. But instead of stone, he built most of the church using greenheart wood from Guyana. Greenheart is one of the stiffest woods in the world, highly durable, rot resistant and resistant to most insect attacks. Despite its wooden structure, the new St. George’s was built to last. The cathedral was completed and consecrated on November 8, 1894. At the time, St. George’s Cathedral was the tallest wooden church in the world, its tower reaching a height of 143 feet. It held this record until 2003 when the 246-feet-tall Peri Monastery near Săpânţa in northern Romania was completed. The new St. George’s Cathedral was a success, and its grand interior, complete with Gothic arches, clustered columns and flying buttresses, soon began to fill with an array of donated pieces, which today reflect the history of the cathedral as well as the colonial past of Guyana. The beautifully carved Bishop’s Throne was given by a Mrs. Manget in commemoration of the Bishop’s Jubilee. The Diocese of Barbados gifted the brass lectern, shaped in the form of an eagle. From the Howell-Jones family, proprietors of the Houston Sugar Estate came the iron pulpit. Chinese Christians donated the sedilia, and other benefactors provided the great east windows and other stained glass windows. Even Queen Victoria showed her appreciation for the cathedral, donating the large chandelier that still hangs prominently in St. George’s.  St. George's Cathedral is located along a roundabout on North Road in Lacytown, Georgetown, a few blocks to the north-east of Stabroek Market. The cathedral has been undergoing a major restoration project since 2017, and works continue. Don’t be surprised if you see scaffolding covering at least one side of the cathedral, and more works inside."
116,Fort Kyk-Over-Al,Guyana,"A brick arch is all that remains of this Dutch fort, once a focal point for colonial power struggles in Guyana.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fort-kykoveral,"All that remains of Fort Kyk-Over-Al is a small brick archway and some scattered foundations. But in its heyday, this small Dutch fort was an important center of colonial operations in the region, and a target for rival British forces. In 1616, Dutch colonists came to what is now Guyana to create a colonial stronghold in the region. They traveled from the coast up the Essequibo River and created a strategically-located trading post on a 1.5-acre island near the confluence of the Essequibo, Mazaruni and Cuyuni Rivers. Here, under the command of the Dutch captain Adrian Groenewegen (who had been sent by the Anglo-Dutch firm of Courteen and Company to establish a settlement in Essequibo) they built a small star-shaped fort. Armed with just a few guns, it was possibly one of the smallest forts ever built by the Dutch overseas. The new fort was initially named Fort ter Hoogen, after an influential Dutch businessman. But it was soon renamed in a more descriptive manner: Kyk-Over-Al, meaning “see over all,” in reference to the fort’s commanding views of the rivers. Groenewegen was particularly interested in exploration and trade, and was soon trading successfully with the indigenous population, with Kyk-Over-Al at the heart of these operations. In turn, however, Kyk-Over-Al became a tempting target for British colonial interests in the region. In 1665, Major John Scott was sent by the Governor of Barbados, Lord Willoughby, to invade the settlements in the Pomeroon and Essequibo. After seizing the settlement of Nova Zeelandia with his Carib allies, Scott pushed further up the Essequibo River and occupied Kyk-Over-Al with just 20 men. Scott was overstretched, however, and couldn’t hold the fort for long. The Dutch Commander of the colonial settlement of Berbice, Matthys Bergenaar, marched overland with a group of soldiers and retook Kyk-Over-Al. At the same time, a French force, allied with the Dutch, besieged the 50 English troops left at Nova Zeelandia and starved them into surrender, and they were soon after massacred by the Arawaks, who were allied with the French. Kyk-Over-Al was redeveloped after the British attacks and, by 1676, trade and local sugarcane plantations were once again thriving. But while the British had backed away, French privateers were becoming increasingly active along the Essequibo River in the early 18th century. They launched attacks on settlements and forts along the river in 1708 to 1712, but were either driven away or paid a ransom to leave. Despite standing strong for one hundred years, Fort Kyk-Over-Al was eventually abandoned. The small island had become overcrowded by 1716, and the decision was made to build a new fort on Fort Island, much closer to the mouth of the Essequibo River and the Atlantic Ocean. Kyk-Over-Al soon outlived its usefulness. It was completely abandoned in 1748 and nearly all of the buildings on the island were demolished. Some of the materials were used to build a sugar mill at Plantation Duyenenburg on the Essequibo River. Today, a single brick arch is all that remains of Fort Kyk-Over-Al. It was nonetheless declared a national monument in 1999 and is now managed by the National Trust of Guyana.  The ruins of Fort Kyk-Over-Al are located on a small island at the confluence of the Mazaruni and Cuyuni Rivers, about 47 miles southwest of Georgetown. The nearest town is Bartica on the left bank of the Essequibo River in Cuyuni-Mazaruni (Region 7), about two hours from Georgetown."
117,Stabroek Market,"Georgetown, Guyana","The largest market in Guyana, designed and built by the Edge Moor Iron Company of Delaware.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stabroek-market,"Few places in the Guyanese capital of Georgetown are quite as hectic or historic as Stabroek Market. Built by the Edge Moor Iron Company of Delaware in 1880, the iron and steel structure is possibly the oldest building still in use in the city. The site on which Stabroek Market currently stands may well have been a marketplace for at least a century prior to the existing construction. Accounts exist of a marketplace at this location in 1792, where enslaved Africans sold their produce on Sundays. At that time Georgetown was under Dutch rule, and the city itself was known as Stabroek. In 1799, the English traveler Henry Bolingbroke described Stabroek Market as such: “There is a market place where the Negroes assemble to sell their truck such as fruits, vegetables, fowls and eggs and where hucksters expose for sale articles of European manufacture in addition to salt beef, pork, fish, cheese, pipes, tobacco and other articles.” It wasn’t until 1843, with the city under British rule and renamed Georgetown, that the location was officially recognized as a market. With this now clarified, the Town Council set about building a marketplace using local hardwoods. It was a fine structure by most accounts, but by 1870 it was deemed inadequate. A committee was formed to discuss plans for a new market, and by 1879 six plans had been submitted. The Edge Moor Iron Company of Delaware, USA, won the contract, with a structure estimated at a cost of $132,855 including freight and the erection of the building in the colony of British Guiana. Construction began on August 17, 1879 and the new market was completed and declared open on November 1, 1880. A report in the Royal Gazette described the inauguration: “The market was opened this morning without any ceremony what so ever, the only signs of festivity being the flags disposed about the buildings and on the stalls. In the course of the day however a band of music made its appearance and discoursed sweet strains of music to the intense satisfaction of the mob, which had gathered. Some ladies keeping their stalls forgot their dignified station so far as to indulge.” The Stabroek Market, then as now, covers an area of about 80,000 square feet (7,000 m2), making it the largest market in Guyana. The steel-framed structure is estimated to weigh about 635 tons. Above the main entrance to the market is a steel tower holding a four-dialed clock, which was ordered from the E. Howard Company of Boston, Massachusetts in 1880. The clock tower also houses an iron bell manufactured in Sheffield, England, which once struck every half hour. Currently, however, the clock is out of action, a source of much argument, especially in light of the $41,000 donated by the United States Embassy in Guyana in 2016, specifically for the restoration of the market’s iconic timepiece. The absence of a functioning clock has done nothing to diminish the market’s frenetic atmosphere. Stalls are often mixed in random fashion, selling everything from fresh produce to jewelry, electronics, books, shoes and live birds. At peak market hours it’s the busiest place in the city: a chaotic, colorful and clamorous space where crime is common, so keep a tight grip on your bag.  Stabroek Market is located along the Demerara River along Georgetown’s western flank. The market opens daily from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., but closes early every third Wednesday so the market can be cleaned. Safety is an issue in Stabroek Market and robberies are a daily occurrence, so don’t bring any valuables, keep a firm grip on your bag, and watch out for pickpockets."
118,1763 Monument,"Georgetown, Guyana","A monument to Cuffy, a rebellious enslaved person who became a national hero in Guyana.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/1763-monument,"The 1763 Monument proudly stands in the Square of the Revolution in the Guyanese capital of Georgetown. Unveiled in 1976, it commemorates the Berbice Slave Rebellion of 1763, a major event in Guyana’s anti-colonial struggles. On February 23, 1763, a slave revolt broke out in the Dutch colony of Berbice in what is now Guyana. At the time, the colony consisted of approximately 350 white colonists, 250 enslaved indigenous people, and almost 4,000 black enslaved people. Should a rebellion gain any traction, the colonial rulers would therefore find themselves in no small amount of trouble. And that’s exactly what happened. The uprising began on the Magdalenenberg Plantation, in protest of the inhumane treatment of the enslaved people by their colonial masters. The main house and outbuildings were torched, and the rebels moved on to one plantation after another, liberating other enslaved Africans who then joined the spreading rebellion. At the Lilienburg Plantation, a house enslaved person named Cuffy (variously Coffy, Kofi or Koffi) of West African origin joined the revolt. He became the leader of the rebellion, training the rebel forces to fight as a unit against the Dutch militia. He took the wife of the manager of Plantation Bearestyn as his wife, and soon declared himself Governor of Berbice. Despite taking control of Berbice, Cuffy and the rebellion were ultimately undone by internal conflict. Cuffy had selected a man named Akara as his deputy, but Akara was a more aggressive leader and disapproved of Cuffy’s attempts to establish a truce and make terms with the Dutch. Akara formed a group to oppose Cuffy, and when Cuffy lost he took his own life. About a year after the start of the rebellion, troops from neighboring French and British colonies arrived to assist the Dutch and the rebellion was defeated. Despite this defeat, Cuffy became a national hero of Guyana, and a symbol of the fight against colonial powers. In 1976, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Guyana’s independence, a statue of Cuffy was unveiled on the Square of the Revolution in the Guyanese capital of Georgetown. The statue is officially called the 1763 Monument, but is often referred to as the Cuffy Monument. The statue, which stands at 15 feet tall and weighs two and a half tons, was designed by Guyanese sculptor Philip Moore and cast in England by the Morris Singer Foundry. The figure of Cuffy bears many symbols: his pouting mouth is a sign of defiance; the face on his chest is a symbolic breastplate giving protection in battle; and the horned faces on his thighs represent revolutionaries from Guyanese history, including Quamina from the Demerara rebellion of 1823. In his hands he holds a pig and a dog, each being throttled, the pig representing ignorance, and the dog covetousness and greed.  The 1763 Monument is located in the Square of the Revolution in the center of Georgetown, between Homestretch Avenue, Vlissingen Road and Hadfield Street."
119,Demerara Harbour Bridge,"Georgetown, Guyana",The end appears to be nigh for the world's fourth-longest floating bridge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/demerara-harbour-bridge,"The Demerara Harbour Bridge spans the Demerara River about three miles south of the Guyanese capital of Georgetown. At the time of its construction, it was the longest floating bridge in the world. The bridge was commissioned on July 2, 1978. With the majority of Guyana’s population living in or around Georgetown, the bridge was a vital transportation link across the Demerara River, connecting the main part of the capital with West Bank Demerara. The bridge was funded by the British Government and was designed, manufactured, and erected by Thos Storey, a bridge construction company established in Stockport, England, in the 1930s. The bridge has 61 spans, with the whole thing kept afloat by 114 pontoons. At its high span, it has a vertical clearance of 26 feet (7.9 meters) and a horizontal clearance of 105 feet (32 meters), allowing small craft to pass at all times. To allow larger craft to pass, including bulk ore carriers, the bridge has a retractor span that retracts fully, leaving a horizontal clearance of 254 feet (77.4 meters). The bridge’s most impressive statistic is its length. Stretching for 6,074 feet (1,851 meters), it currently ranks as the fourth-longest floating bridge in the world. The top spot is currently held by the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge that carries Washington State Route 520 across Lake Washington from Seattle to its eastern suburbs. When it was built, the Demerara Harbour Bridge was only designed to last 10 years. Despite that seemingly meager lifespan, the bridge is still going strong. On average, about 14,000 vehicles pass over it each day. The future of the bridge, however, is uncertain. Since 2015, plans have been afoot to build a new bridge over the Demerara River. In 2017, it was officially announced that a new bridge will be built a mile or so north of the existing bridge, with a completion date of 2020. At the time, a feasibility study declared that the existing bridge “has long passed its technical lifetime.” The end could be nigh for the Demerara Harbour Bridge, unless some vocal supporters get their way. In July 2018, Minister of State Joseph Harmon argued that there was no reason to demolish the existing structure, saying “I see absolutely no sensible reason to decommission one, where you have another one. I will lend my voice to that chorus which says that we should keep both bridges.” He also called the bridge a “tangible heritage” to all Guyanese.  The Demerara Harbour Bridge crosses from Peter’s Hall to Meer Zorgen. It is a toll bridge, although traffic running west to east doesn't have to pay. The toll is $200 Guyanese dollars, which is about $1 USD. The bridge has an ongoing retraction schedule to allow large vessels to pass through. You can check the schedule at the Demerara Harbour Bridge website."
120,Statue of Queen Victoria,"Georgetown, Guyana","Though dynamited and defaced, the statue still stands outside the law courts in Georgetown, Guyana.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/statue-of-queen-victoria,"Outside the High Court in the Guyanese capital of Georgetown stands a stoic-looking statue of Queen Victoria. Since its unveiling in 1894, the controversial statue has been removed and returned, decapitated and defaced, but as of yet remains standing as a contentious symbol of Guyana’s colonial past. In 1887, the colonial rulers of what was then British Guiana commissioned a statue of Queen Victoria to mark her Golden Jubilee. Created by the English sculptor Henry Richard Hope-Pinker, the marble statue was unveiled in 1894 outside the High Court in Georgetown. The statue stood in relative peace for more than half a century. Then, in 1954, the statue became the target of anti-colonial protests stirred up by repressive measures taken by the Colonial Office. The statue was dynamited and its head and left hand were blown off. It was sent to England to be repaired, and returned to Georgetown. Guyana gained its independence in 1966 and became a Cooperative Republic in 1970, at which time the statue of Victoria was moved to a quiet corner of the capital’s botanical gardens. Then, in 1990, the city’s mayor decided to restore the statue and return it to its original location in front of the High Court. Many locals were surprised, and some were enraged. Calls for the removal of the statue continued throughout the following decades, but local authorities were not inclined to listen. Then, in June 2018, Queen Victoria suffered another attack, this time with red paint. Many condemned the act of vandalism, while others saw it as a justifiable move by anti-colonial activists. The person or persons who defaced the statue faced a fine of up to $20,000 or 12 months in prison, but were never caught. The statue, meanwhile, was restored. It still stands outside the High Court in Georgetown, but for how long remains to be seen.  The statue of Queen Victoria stands in front of the High Court in Georgetown, near the corner of Charlotte Street and King Street. It’s easy to see from the road."
