0,Donkey Sanctuary Aruba,"Santa Cruz, Aruba",A safe place for the wild donkeys of a hot vacation destination.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/donkey-sanctuary-aruba,"In the rough desert interior of an island known for its beaches, the Aruba Donkey Sanctuary houses and cares for some of the island’s most vulnerable early immigrants. These adorable equines were brought to the island as beasts of burden during the colonial era and then, when their usefulness came to an end, they were released to fend for themselves. They thrived in packs until overpopulation made them a nuisance. Many of the “wild” donkeys were shot, fed to visiting circus animals and hit by cars. On top of that, their population was decimated by disease, and they nearly died out. However, in the mid-twentieth century, a movement began to save the Aruban donkeys, and today the humble non-profit sanctuary provides food, shelter, and medical care to almost two hundred animals. Visitors can feed and pet the donkeys, and locals are encouraged to adopt them. Take route 4A from the hotels. At the Pizza Hut in Paradera take a left turn. At the second intersection, just before Ayo Rock formation, you will find the white/brown road signs to the sanctuary."
1,Bushiribana Gold Mill Ruins,"Noord, Aruba","The remnants of an abandoned, 19th-century gold mill along Aruba's rugged northeastern coast.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bushiribana-gold-mill-ruins,"On Aruba’s rugged, desertlike northeastern coast sits a remnant of the island’s once-bustling gold mining industry— the Bushiribana Gold Mill Ruins. Constructed in 1872 by the London-based Aruba Island Gold Mining Company, the stamp mill harnessed the power of strong ocean winds to crush stone and isolate gold ore. A smelter on site processed the ore into fine gold, which was driven to a nearby harbor for export. The mill operated for a decade, refining more than 2,000 ounces of gold before production halted in 1883 (likely due to the high cost of operation). It was reopened in 1889 by another British company, the Aruba Agency Company. This operation also lasted for a decade and the Bushiribana mill was permanently closed in 1899 as attention shifted to a newer, state-of-the-art mill at Balashi, in Aruba’s interior. After more than a century of vacancy, only the natural stone walls of the Bushiribana Gold Mill remain. Visitors to the ruins can walk freely throughout the abandoned structure and can carefully climb the remnants of a staircase on the mill’s southern wall to enjoy sweeping views of the Caribbean. The Bushiribana Gold Mill Ruins are a frequent stop on numerous ATV and off-road vehicle tours of Aruba’s northeastern coast."
2,Pig Beach,"Big Major Cay, Bahamas","In paradise, feral pigs have claimed an island all to themselves.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/swimming-pigs-of-big-major-cay,"Just north of Staniel Cay in the Outer Exumas is Big Major Cay. On this small, uninhabited island, there’s a group of feral pigs. The pigs are regularly fed by those who go out to visit them, which is often those staying at Fowl Cay Resort, where boats are available and all the regulars direct visitors to the pigs because they never cease to amaze. If you are offshore in a boat, the pigs will swim out to you. But beware: If you get too shallow (like three feet of water or so), the pigs can—and probably will—jump into your boat and look for your lunch. But that’s only if they’re feeling especially friendly. The pigs control the island, roaming on their own terms, but they prefer to stay in the shade during the sunny hours, venturing onto the beach and into the waters when it cools down a bit. It’s unclear how the pigs got there, some believing they survived a shipwreck, others say that sailors left them there for a future meal and never returned. Recently, up to 10 of the Bahamas’ swimming pigs were found dead. Though initial reports suggested that tourists had given the pigs fatal doses of alcohol, Humane Society inspector Ventoi Bethune told National Geographic that the dead swine had likely ingested sand. Another theory was that this was brought about by the unusually dry January. Veterinarians who visited the site found large quantities of sand in the deceased animals’ stomachs, which Bethune says may have been caused by a recent influx of visitors throwing small amounts of food on the beach.  From Nassau, take a plane to Staniel Cay. Rent a boat from the Staniel Cay Yacht Club and go north about a mile. It is also possible to flight directly from the USA to George Town (Great Exuma) and go from there directly by boat. You can also fly from Fort Lauderdale to Staniel Cay with Watermarkers Air. Another option is to take a day trip from Nassau. Just bear in mind that those tours take up to eight to nine hours, are subject to weather conditions, and are not suitable for expectant mothers, infants, and people with back, knee, neck, and heart problems or conditions affected by high-speed travel."
3,Dean's Blue Hole,Bahamas,One of the deepest blue holes in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/deans-blue-hole,"Plunging to a depth of 663 feet (202 meters) in a bay west of Clarence Town on Long Island, Dean’s Blue Hole is one of the deepest known blue holes. A blue hole is a term that is often given to sinkholes that are filled with water, while the entrance to them is located beneath the surface. While most other known blue holes only reach maximum depths of 360 feet, the 663 foot depth of Dean’s Blue Hole makes it quite exceptional. At the surface, Dean’s Blue Hole is roughly circular with a diameter ranging from 82-115 feet (25-35 meters). After one descends 66 feet below the surface, the hole widens considerably into a cavern with a diameter of 330 feet (100 meters). The water at Dean’s Blue Hole is extremely clear and on good days the visibility can reach 115 feet. In April 2010, professional diver William Trubridge broke a free-diving world record in the blue hole by reaching a depth of 302 feet (92 meters) without the use of fins. He took that even further when on December 14, 2010, he swam to a depth of 331 feet (101 meters) on a single breath while using only his hands and feet for propulsion. In November of 2013, however, free-diver Nicholas Mevoli died during an effort to dive to a new American record."
4,Nurse Sharks of Compass Cay,Bahamas,"They squeal, they nosh, they look like predators.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nurse-sharks-of-compass-cay,"Nurse sharks are kind of like Bahamian catfish in the shape of a predator. Bottom feeders, nurse sharks mostly appear to sit down on the bottom of the shallows and suck sediment and little critters from the sand. If you are underwater near them, you can hear them squeal a high-pitched sound. While they may be benign and catfish-like, the reality is that they look like a shark. They have a dorsal fin. They are big. Did we mention the dorsal fin, that sign so often associated with the terrifying man-eating monsters of the sea ever since Spielberg focused his attention on a young Richard Dreyfuss and that small town’s celebration of the Fourth of July near the sea? At Compass Cay, which is a private island in the Outer Exumas, just south of the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park, the marina workers feed the fish. This makes them very friendly animals; they’re not likely to expend the extra effort to gnaw off a leg when they know that they’re going to get something much better hand-fed to them. They have names. They swim up to you. They are photogenic. Please be aware that they can, and will bite, if they feel menaced. In July 2018, a 19-year-old model was attacked (without major consequences) while taking pictures with them. From Staniel Cay, it's a bit of a stretch by whaler. It can be done, but a larger boat is better."
5,Ocean Atlas,"Nassau, Bahamas",The world’s largest underwater sculpture is found just off the coast of Nassau.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ocean-atlas,"Artist, photographer, naturalist, and diver Jason deCaires Taylor introduced his record-breaking public sculpture to the crystal Bahamian waters in 2014. Entitled Ocean Atlas, the installation encourages coral colonization and deters tourists from endangered reefs. Forged from sustainable, pH-neutral materials designed to kickstart local coral growth, Ocean Atlas is a monumental public sculpture submerged five meters beneath the sea, and an environmental gesture intended to portray the positive potential of human interaction with the natural world. Located off the west coast of New Providence in Nassau, Ocean Atlas is Taylor’s contemporary take on the ancient Greek myth of Atlas—a Titan condemned to carry the heavens on his back for eternity. Rather, Ocean Atlas, commissioned by BREEF (Bahamas Reef Environment Educational Foundation), is a young Bahamian girl “sustaining the ceiling of the ocean,” Taylor’s website explains, as “our oceans and coral reefs currently [face] collapse from numerous threats including overfishing, habitat loss, ocean acidification, global warming and water pollution…” Taylor founded the world’s first underwater sculpture park in Grenada’s Molinere Bay in 2006. The project, entitled Viccisitudes, was inaugurated with 16 statues of local Grenadian women. The installation is now comprised of 75 sculptures—each depicting a real person—sprawling over 800 square meters. Taylor has since designed two more submerged museums: MUSA (Museo Subacuático de Arte) in Cancun, billed on his website as “one of the largest and most ambitious underwater artificial art attractions in the world,” with over 500 permanent sculptures forged to scale; and Museo Atlántico, the first submerged contemporary art museum in the Atlantic Ocean, based off the coast of Lanzarote, Spain.  'Ocean Atlas' is submerged at a depth of five meters off the coast of Nassau within Clifton Heritage National Park."
6,Bimini Road,"North Bimini Island, Bahamas",An underwater road considered a possible Atlantis location.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bimini-road,"According to Greek legend, the city of Atlantis sunk into the ocean in one single day, wiping its existence off the earth 11,000 years ago. Since that time, scientists, treasure hunters and philosophers have searched endlessly to find even a trace of the lost world, said to be partially intact somewhere below the ocean waves. Being one of the most well-known legends in the world, anything found during an ocean dive even resembling a manmade structure has caused serious waves of media attention. In 1968, a diver off the coast of North Bimini Island, Bahamas discovered a series of stones 18 feet below the surface. The stones appeared manmade, and were evenly spaced out in a road-like line stretching a half mile. A storm of publicity immediately descended on the discovery, with a number of individuals claiming the stones were a portion of wall, or a road that was formerly part of a larger city. Everyone hoped the discovery would be connected to Atlantis, and the discovery of two other similar “roads,” spurred the excitement. Unfortunately, carbon dating, and analysis of the blocks led to the conclusion that the roads were made naturally through geological forces. No tool marks were found on the blocks, and there was no evidence that the blocks had ever been stacked to build a structure. Although there is still some speculation and research on Bimini today, it is generally agreed upon that the limestone blocks were formed by erosion, leaving the mystery of Atlantis unsolved."
7,Subsurface Bahamian Caves,"Andros I, Bahamas",Inhospitable caverns just beneath this island paradise offer insights into alien worlds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/subsurface-bahamian-caves,"One can picture extraterrestrial researchers doing any number of things. Scanning starry nights with a telescope. Listening for radio signals beamed from other worlds with skyscraper-sized antennas. Unraveling government conspiracies alongside a skeptical redhead. Yet somehow, scuba diving doesn’t spring to mind. But that’s exactly what regularly brings researchers to the Bahamas, where just below the turquoise water and balmy sea breezes that make visitors lament not being able to stay forever, one of the harshest environments on the planet exists. “Blue Holes,” as they are often called due to the small circle of water they form in the inland soil (and their similarities to the more well-known offshore variety), sometimes form the entrance to a vast network of underground caverns. The caverns are completely submerged and contain zero or near-zero percent oxygen – and that’s just the first of their remarkable traits. Scientists looking to gain an understanding of what life might be like on planets other than Earth have very few resources to turn to. The planet they live on happens to be nearly 100% Earth, and the alternate environments they have some access to (the moon, Mars) happen to, thus far, have zero life forms. So they turn to some of Earth’s least hospitable environments to see what’s going on there. Research takes them from the cracked desert floor of the Mojave to the North Pole and the sub-freezing water beneath it – anyplace, really, where nothing might turn into something. But the caves in the Bahamas have something those other places don’t: diversity. Zero light and an underwater environment have created some interesting life forms in other places, but the unique combination of reduced gravitational effects and a saltwater-rich environment largely shielded from external forces have created a fascinating incubator for the growth of microorganisms. And perhaps more importantly, a lack of others – the bacteria that usually cause trouble for terrestrial environments have a hard time growing here, and if they do, it’s in a unique way that results in a high volume of deadly hydrogen sulfide. The caves can be an archeologist’s fantasy as well, as the lack of oxygen and bacteria have resulted in some remarkably well-preserved bones and artifacts. But the environment isn’t well explored because it’s highly dangerous and unpredictable. Nearly impenetrable by casual exploration, only highly skilled divers or submersible robots can really delve into the caverns, and if the lack of oxygen and seemingly endless space weren’t problem enough, hydrogen sulfide reaches lethal levels not far below the water’s surface. The Bahamas’ inland blue holes are not the place for a vacation – that much is clear. But for scientists and adventure seekers alike, they do represent a sort of El Dorado, offering a wealth of hidden secrets that have barely been seen or examined to this point."
8,Glass Window Bridge,Bahamas,This isthmus in the Bahamas narrowly separates the roiling Atlantic from the cool Bight of Eleuthera.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glass-window-bridge,"When Winslow Homer painted “Glass Window” he was on assignment for Century Magazine, chronicling his trip to the Bahamas in watercolors. It was 1885, and the artist saw this bridge in its original state—a natural stone arch barely separating the Atlantic Ocean from the Bight of Eleuthera. The stone arch connecting Eleuthera island’s two narrow strips of land that Homer saw is long gone, washed away by hurricanes. But the name he gave the unique site has stuck. Still called the Glass Window Bridge, it’s a vulnerable spot that has been destroyed and rebuilt many times in the intervening 130 years. Often called the “Narrowest Place on Earth”, the bridge today still provides a view of the stunning contrast between the Atlantic and Bight of Eleuthera’s distinct natures. Occasionally, when a strong wave washes over the rocks, for a brief moment that separation disappears, and the two bodies of water shake hands.  Queen's Highway runs the length of Eleuthera, a skinny island only a mile wide in some spots, and 110 miles long. The Glass Window Bridge connects the north island to the south, and you can get there by car or bike.Be aware of the force of the waves from the Atlantic side, which can hit unexpectedly and with some force. Caution is advised."
9,Queen's Staircase,"Nassau, Bahamas",This staircase in a lush tropical grotto was built by enslaved laborers and renamed to honor Queen Victoria's role in ending slavery in the British Empire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/queen-s-staircase,"Hand-carved from solid limestone rock by 600 enslaved people, the Queen’s Staircase was built between 1793 and 1794 to provide a direct route from Fort Fincastle, a battery protecting the entrance to Nassau  Harbor (notorious in that era for attracting pirates and geopolitical intrigue) to the central part of the Bahamian capital. In the 1800s, the massive, 65-step staircase was named in honor of Queen Victoria, who had signed a declaration abolishing slavery on her ascension to the throne in 1837 before reigning for 64 years. The 700-island archipelago of the Bahamas is today an independent Commonwealth, having separated from the United Kingdom in 1973, but still nominally ruled by the British monarch. Today the staircase is the centerpiece of a stunning tropical grotto replete with swaying palms, waterfalls, and an unusual set of bathrooms hewn directly out of the 100-foot sheer limestone walls like the rock-gouged temples at Petra. Exquisite at any time of day or night, after dark the staircase becomes a quiet, cool, lush, and romantic oasis barely a mile from the bustling downtown and cruise ship docks of modern Nassau.  Located at the top of Elizabeth Avenue, off Shirley Street. Local guides hang out at the site and will tell you about the history of the staircase for a fee. Note that the steps are relatively steep and can be slippery when wet."
10,Underwater Plane Wreck Near Staniel Cay,"Rokers Point Settlement, Bahamas",One of the most accessible undersea plane wrecks in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/underwater-plane-wreck-near-staniel-cay,"Divers, historians and scuba enthusiasts often train for years to explore undersea wreckage, but this dive site can be found in just over six feet of water. Located about half a mile away from Staniel Cay Yacht Club, the wreckage of this plane crash might be the most accessible artificial dives in the world. In about six feet of warm Bahamian water, the remains of this plane wreck don’t let the shallow conditions stop them from becoming a sanctuary for many fish and coral species, as crash sites often do. In addition to vegetation and the usual wandering schools of tropical fish usually found near undersea structures, this wreckage is known for the nurse sharks who like sleep under its wings."
11,The Musician,Bahamas,A full-scale sculpture of a mermaid and baby grand piano hidden underwater by David Copperfield.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-musician-bahamas,"A strange surprise waits beneath the waves for snorkelers splashing through the waters around magician David Copperfield’s private islands. Just off the coast of Rudder Cut Cay, swimmers will find a life-sized sculpture of a mermaid lounging atop the sandy ocean floor. The mermaid waits near the bench of a baby grand piano as if beckoning divers to sit down and play her a tune. The stainless steel sculpture is hidden about 12 to 15 feet below the surface and can be a bit difficult to spot when the current stirs up the sand and clouds the water. It makes discovering them on a clear day feel all the more magical. Snorkelers capable of holding their breath for a while like to swim down and pose atop the bench as if they, too, belong in this underwater world. Copperfield, who owns multiple private islands within the Bahamas, commissioned the artwork from Jason DeCaires Taylor and had it sunk as a quirky surprise for the few, exclusive guests who stay on the private island or those who take boat trips to snorkel off the shore."
12,Great Isaac Cay,Bahamas,"Bermuda triangle lighthouse, site of mysterious disappearances, left to crumble into the Atlantic.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-isaac-cay,"Erected in the 1850s to prevent merchant ships from disappearing in the Bermuda Triangle, the 152-foot tall Great Isaac Lighthouse has become more of a participant in the area’s mysteries than a protector. The cay itself is one giant coral head - a colony of genetically identical coral polyps - rising a few feet out of the area’s shallow, dangerous reefs. Razor sharp terrain makes the land inhospitable and difficult to traverse. For over a century the barren island was occupied by lighthouse keepers, but on August 4, 1969, it was discovered that the caretakers had gone missing. Their bodies were never found, and while it’s anyone’s guess as to what may have happened, a hurricane that passed through a few days prior is thought to be the likeliest culprit. After their disappearance, the Great Isaac Light was automated, shining a white beam every 15 seconds to sailors up to 23 nautical miles away. The rest of the compound’s buildings have been left to crumble. Adding to the island’s macabre history, 19th century lore has it that a ship wrecked on Great Isaac Cay, killing everyone aboard except one young infant. Locals claim that the infant’s mother (known as the Grey Lady) can still be seen roaming the island, and her wails of sorrow can be heard on full moons. Though the cay’s grounds are open to the public, the bottom few stairs in the tower are missing, and the storage bunkers and buildings are locked. Exploring is expected and part of the fun, though falling on the rocks or cutting yourself while shimmying up the lighthouse’s rusty staircase are both real possibilities and may earn you a fresh tetanus shot. Moderate agility and seafaring skill is required to make landfall.  Located 20 nautical miles North of the Bimini Islands. You'll need a boat and a map to get there on your own. Commercial tours can be arranged from Bimini."
13,Primeval Forest National Park,"Nassau, Bahamas",Impressive sink holes fill this untouched old-growth forest in the Bahamas.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/primeval-forest-national-park,"The Primeval Forest National Park is a geological and botanical gem, tucked away in the bustling, commercial capital of the Bahamas. The ancient hardwood forest, which is largely untouched by humans, is one of the best preserved plots of old-growth woodland in the country. From the early 1700s up into the 1970s, the logging industry within the Bahamas led to the mass exploitation of large hardwood trees. A shift in logging licenses, plus an increased awareness of the environmental importance of living, standing trees, finally slowed the culling. Pericles Maillis, the former president of the British National Trust, stumbled upon the undisturbed patch of forest that would one day become the Primeval Forest National Park as a boy. In the late ’90s, he led the initiative to protect the land. It’s a small park, only about 7.5 acres in total, but it serves as a mini time capsule of Nassau’s former evergreen, tropical environment. The forest is filled with an array of pines, hemlocks, mosses, termite mounds, and even a fossilized conch shell. But the star attraction is the sinkholes. The impressive limestone caverns, some of which are up to 50 feet long and 30 feet deep, are scattered throughout the park. The sinkholes occur because of the abundance of water that causes the limestone, a highly porous rock, to weather. They’re easily accessed via a series of boardwalks, steps, and bridges. The park, which also has a small visitor’s center full of geological facts, was established in 2002.  Park hours are limited, so be sure it will be open when you go."
14,SS Sapona,Bahamas,A steamer run aground near Bimini lives a second life as a playground for scuba divers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ss-sapona,"The SS Sapona - a concrete steamer built for war, used for decadence, and in death, serving as a haunting and beautiful place for divers to explore. The SS Sapona never had a chance to live up to her potential. Built by the Liberty Ship Building Company, she wasn’t finished by the time the war ended, and was sold for scrap before getting a chance to sail. Moved to Bimini by new owner Bruce Bethel, the ship served her first real purpose - as a sneaky storage spot to stash booze in during the prohibition. Bethel had wild fantasies of turning the vessel into a floating nightclub, but alas, that glamorous plan was never meant to be, and the ship ran aground and was broken into pieces by a hurricane in 1926. After suffering the indignity of becoming target practice for US forces during WWII, and slowly disintegrating as time and weather took their toll, the SS Sapona has broken apart and settled in. Submerged in about 15 ft. of water, the rusty remains serve as a quiet, serene playground for local fish and the humans who snorkel and dive among them."
15,Dolphin House Museum,"Alice Town, Bahamas",One man's love of sea life and art has turned his home into a temple of outsider island art.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dolphin-house,"Ashley Saunders, a local author, artist, historian and retired teacher on the island of Bimini has opened his home, the Dolphin House Museum, to visitors who can take in his chaotic mosaics that act as homages to his island’s history. Saunders whose family has lived on Bimini since the American Revolution has built a unique house and a landmark tourist attraction.  In 1993, he began construction of a house unlike any other using found and recycled materials to decorate every inch of the concrete structure.  The Dolphin House in Alice Town (North Bimini) is a thick and sturdy building, purpose-designed to withstand the ugly forces of passing hurricanes, yet also embellished by the careful touches of an artist.  The interior and exterior walls are completely covered in mosaics composed of colorful tiles, shells, bottles, coins, and all manner of other found objects. He has used materials from demolition sites and shoreline cast-offs from various places. Saunders warmly invites any and all guests to see his home and learn not only about his unique artistic vision but also of the history of the Bahamas island he loves so much.  The intense love he has for his island home motivated him to write two volumes of the History of Bimini and four books of island poetry. Mr. Saunders considers himself a dolphin inspired artist who tells a story of swimming with a large pod of wild Bimini dolphins and attributes his artistic vision to that inspirational experience. “The dolphins touched my heart and made me an artist.” - Ashley Saunders"
16,The Cow and the Bull,Bahamas,These two giant boulders mysteriously perched on a 60-foot cliff may have been slung up there by a raging tsunami.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-cow-and-the-bull-bahamas,"Two enormous limestone boulders are perched at the edge of a cliff, on a rocky surface 60 feet above the Atlantic Ocean. They formed on the ocean floor anywhere from 300,000 to 400,000 years ago. So how did they get up there? The rocks, known locally as the Cow and the Bull, are part of a mysterious series of giant boulders on the coast of Eleuthera island in the Bahamas. Seven massive rocks form an almost perfect line along an especially narrow portion of the 110-mile coastline. The “Cow” and the “Bull” weigh 1,000 and 2,000 tons respectively and are each over 20 feet tall. Some scientists believe the massive boulders may have been lifted to the clifftop millennia ago by a powerful tsunami caused by the changing climate. Bahamians refer to the area’s massive waves—powerful enough that they have displaced the concrete slabs of a road just north of the boulders—as “rages.” James Hansen, a retired NASA scientist, believes those waves were even more powerful 100,000 years ago during catastrophic superstorms produced by a warming period known as the Eemian. The oceans rose a great deal towards the end of the Eemian, and Hansen theorizes it was during that time tsunamis slung the boulders up onto the cliff. The informative placards for visitors concur, claiming the ocean “lifted them atop the ridge.” There is contention, however, among scientists. Hansen is often referred to as “the father of global climate change awareness,” and his opposition believes his explanation is just a ploy to bring more attention to the issue. Hansen’s claim isn’t unprecedented, though; a recent study in the Cape Verde islands off the coast of Africa claims boulders up to 700 tons were lifted more than 900 feet by tsunamis some 73,000 years ago. Some believe the boulders were simply left there after the surrounding rocks eroded to nothing, but that neglects the age of the boulders and the much younger surface below. Regardless of the specifics, something dramatic happened to the landscape so many years ago."
17,Cape Eleuthera Resort Ruins,"South Eleuthera, Bahamas",A paradise hotel turned from opulent to overgrown.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cape-eleuthera-resort-ruins,"Welcome to paradise lost. Located at the southern terminus of Queen’s Highway, on the quiet shoestring-shaped island of Eleuthera, lie the ruins of a decadent era. Opened in 1972, the Cape Eleuthera Resort hosted well-heeled jet-setters during the island’s tourism heyday. Built in conjunction with former Pan Am founder Juan Trippe, who set up a small, now derelict airport nearby, the former resort was an excuse to day-trip from Florida for a round of golf and business luncheons. Described in an advertisement as a “world of beauty on the island of Eleuthera,” the short-lived opulence of the resort ended in 1983 with bankruptcy, followed by a fire and repeated pummeling by hurricanes that pushed the property to disrepair allowing nature to begin reclamation. Included at this site of prime exploration are the ruins of old villas and the former clubhouse, with its palm tree-lined circular driveway and valet parking. Long gone are the tennis courts, manicured beaches, tiled pool, and 18-hole golf course—all of which have been swallowed up by the hungry Bahamian flora. The once manicured network of golf cart roads still exists, albeit pockmarked with potholes and overgrown with vines and invasive Casuarina pines. This jungled landscape is prime for exploration, made up of concentric paths known as the “Outer Loop” and the “Inner Loop,” which houses a ghostly and colossal banyan tree. Today the site lies adjacent to a quaint modern marina with a handful of pastel houses, a milder glimpse into the lavish extravagance of tropical holidays past. Those adventuring to the verdant site can navigate to the predominantly intact “4th Hole,” a fairway that lies adjacent to a secluded beach kissed by azure waves, just one of many natural nooks that make this area prime for fishing, running, and snorkeling.  This site lies at the end of Queen's Highway, past The Island School and adjacent to the rebuilt Cape Eleuthera Resort & Marina. Open to the public, this location is prime for nature exploration, therefore, travelers should dress accordingly."
18,Project HARP Space Gun,Barbados,A giant gun barrel in Barbados that once hoped to shoot outer space with science.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/project-harp-space-gun-barbados,"Not to be confused with the conspiracy factory known as Project HAARP (High-Frequency Active Aural Research Program), Project HARP (High Altitude Research Project) was a joint initiative between the United States and Canada  to research the use of ballistics to deliver objects into the upper atmosphere and beyond. In lay terms, the HARP project was established to create a cartoonishly large gun to shoot things into space. Designed by mad ballistics engineer Gerald Bull, the gun itself was originally built from a 65-foot long, 16” naval cannon, the kind that might be seen on a battleship. The cannon was later joined to another barrel, extending the length of the gun to 130 feet and making it too big for effective military application, but (seemingly) perfect for satellite delivery. The titanic gun was not designed for delivering human subjects, but instead, the cannon fired smaller projectiles in a sabot that would protect the payload during the firing and would fall away as the satellite rose. At its apex, the gun was able to fire an object a staggering 112 miles into the sky, setting the 1963 world record for gun-launched altitude at 93 KM. As the project continued, similar guns were built in locations across the United States, however, the sole surviving fruit of the project is the massive, toppled gun barrel at the Barbados test site. The Barbados gun was abandoned in the late 1960s and left to rust on its original launch site and after years of neglect looks more like a painted sewer pipe than a Godzilla-size gun barrel. Please note that the gun is located on an active military base and is only accessible with permission.  If you really want to do it the right way, contact the military base a couple of months before you go and get their written permission. UPDATE August 2014 : The cannon is now almost totally disappearing under the bushes, and the rust is eating it fast. UPDATE May 2017:  The longer cannon is still easily visible, the secondary one is now hidden in the undergrowth about 10m to the NE of the larger one, sections of its barrel are just visible. Not an easy place to reach, actually (4x4 advised...) It's a ten minutes drive from the Airport. Go East when leaving the Airport, pass by the Concorde Experience warehouse, keep going on the main road (direction : Saint Martins). Then turn right to Gemswick (the turn is in front of a nice park with bended trees), then left (natural curve of the road), then take the first right, straight down, then left again. Take the unpaved path on the right just BEFORE the bar. Keep going until you reach the cliffs. If you have a 4x4 you can try your luck at the narrow path going down to the meadows, then turn right (West) along the cliffs. Otherwise, you can park and continue on foot (10 minutes walk). The cannon is located just underneath the Airport zone about 700m from the bottom of the path down from the houses."
19,The Animal Flower Cave,"Conneltown, Barbados",Under the desolate and windswept northern coast of Barbados stands a small oasis filled with sea anemones.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-animal-flower-cave,"Discovered in 1750 by a Welsh naturalist and author, the Animal Flower Cave sits at the bottom of the north cliffs of Barbados and opens to where the Atlantic Ocean meets the Caribbean Sea. Accessible by a set of steep coral steps, the cave boasts breathtaking views of a wild ocean landscape whose colors change at the whim of the intermingling clouds and sunshine. The cave gets its name from the sea anemones, what Barbadians call “animal flowers,” that live in the cave’s shallower pools. Named after the anemone flower, the sea anemone looks like a blooming underwater plant but acts like an animal. When it senses approaching predators, it retracts its petal-like tentacles into its trunk and all but disappears. During the winter, visitors can see the spouts and tails of humpback whales cavorting and fishing in the deep waters. The cave’s soundscape boasts the haunting echoes of waves crashing upon the cave’s rocky entrances. With every wave, water flows in and refreshes the pools of water dotting the floor. Visitors are permitted to swim in one of the cave’s deeper pools and frolic upon the rocks that bear the ocean’s rage.  Cave tours are offered every 10 to 15 minutes and are led by a local guide; visitors have the option to swim inside the cave. In addition to the cave, there are several above-ground attractions including a cliffside restaurant overlooking the ocean, a playground, a lookout point for spotting whales and birds, and a snack bar and lounge area. The easiest way to get to the cave is by private car. The cave is also accessible via public transportation. Take a bus or van to the Speightstown bus station and then ask around until you find the van that goes by the cave. The cost of the van from Speightstown to the cave is 3.50 BBD."
20,Harrison's Cave,Barbados,This popular tourist cave was ignored for almost 200 years before being mined into an attraction.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/harrison-s-cave-2,"In an environment as gorgeous as tropical Barbados, its a bit strange that a limestone cave is the number one attraction, but its even stranger that the stunning Harrison’s Cave was almost forgotten altogether. Originally charted in 1795 by local explorers, the caves, despite their rich geologic variety and beauty were left virtually unexplored for nearly 180 years. In 1974, an enterprising caver named Ole Sorenson was commissioned to map out the caverns, and he instantly saw the potential for exploitation. Thanks to the calcium-rich water running down the cave walls and dripping from the ceiling, countless unique geologic formations had grown in the depths of the cave. Work began to excavate new tunnels and divert underground streams to turn the eye-popping rock formations into a more tourist-friendly spelunk. Harrison’s Cave, set in the island’s center in St. Thomas, is named for Thomas Harrison, a prominent 18th-century landowner. This site was opened for business in 1981 and visitors can now take tram rides through the caves, experiencing the carefully groomed wonders of nature.  If you're taking the bus (cheaper than a car of course), you can take the Route 4 Shorey Village bus (large blue bus) from the Bridgetown Terminal. Bus fare by bus or minibus is BDS$2 (US$1)."
21,The Chase Vault,"Oistins, Barbados",A Barbados crypt where it's said that the coffins refuse to stay put.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-chase-vault-oistins-barbados,"The Chase Vault located in the Barbados cemetery of the Christ Church Parish is a fairly unremarkable semi-sunken tomb save for the repeated stories of the coffins inside being thrown around around by mysterious forces. The vault was originally built in 1724 but was purchased by the Chase family when Mary Ann Chase died at the tender age of 2. The little girl was placed in the vault in a lead coffin along with the vault’s single other occupant who was interred in a wooden coffin. Just a few short years later Mary Ann’s sister Dorcas was also buried in the tomb after starving herself to death. Death continued to plague the Chase family when the sisters’ father Thomas died around a month after his eldest daughter. However, when the thick marble slab that sealed the entrance to the vault was removed, the burial team discovered that the three coffins inside had been violently tossed around and were standing against the walls of the tomb in seeming disarray. There was no evidence of human tampering with the sealed vault, and none of the other vaults in the cemetery had been affected in the same way, eliminating the possibility of earthquake or flood. Regardless, all of the coffins were placed back in their original places and Thomas’ was added to the orderly pile. Years later when the vault was once again opened to add another body to the pile, they found the coffins had been tossed around once again and were lying all about the vault. This time, before resealing the seemingly watertight and impenetrable space, a layer of sand was placed on the floor to detect any footprints should the culprits return again. After a couple of years, with the story percolating among the public, the vault was reopened to check on things, and as the story goes, it was revealed in front of throngs of curious onlookers that the coffins had once again been moved around. At this point, all of the coffins were removed from the vault and reburied elsewhere in the cemetery. The empty vault remains open to this day, filled only with ghost stories. However with no coffins to toss around, any malevolent spirit (or committed prankster) may have a hard time making themselves known."
22,First International Flight Stone and Plaque,"Bridgetown, Barbados",This stone commemorates the island's launch into international aviation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/first-international-flight-stone-and-plaque,"Approaching the green, on the right-hand side of the fifth fairway at Rockley Golf & Country Club, stands a large stone. This marks the spot where international aviation history began in Barbados. Barbados’ first international arrival came by way of an Avro Avian. On March 29, 1929, British aviator Bill Lancaster flew the aircraft from Guadeloupe to the Rockley Golf and Country Club where the plane touched down. The golf club also happens to be the oldest on the island dating back to 1910. Lancaster was already a celebrity before the flight, having flown with companion Chubbie Miller from England to Australia, making her the first woman to do so. Lancaster’s later life was marred by scandal and tragedy. He was acquitted of killing Miller’s new lover, before crash-landing in Algeria attempting to break the speed record traveling from England to South Africa. His log confirms that he remained alive for at least eight days, but his remains were not discovered until 1962, when French troops came across his mummified body and the crash site.  There is space to walk down the right hand side of the fifth hole, without interfering with players. The Rockley Golf & Country Club has a hole-by-hole video, and a brief aerial shot of the memorial stone can be seen toward the end of the footage of the fifth hole."
23,The Unfinished Church,Bermuda,"Storms, funding, and in-fighting have kept this Bermuda church from ever being completed.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-unfinished-church-bermuda,"While Bermuda’s Unfinished Church looks as though it was built in medieval times and left to fall apart and rot, it is actually a fairly recent construction that was just never able to be completed due to disastrous weather, the objections of the congregation, and empty coffers. In the 1800s St. Peter’s Church in St. George, Bermuda was severely damaged by a storm. The damage was so devastating that the decision was made to build a brand new church as opposed to even attempting to repair the original. Thus work on the Unfinished Church began in 1874, although it would never finish. Almost immediately, the funding for the project became an issue as there was just not that much to support the project. This led to a decision to turn the funds towards repairing the old church instead, making the new construction obsolete before it was even finished. The project was essentially abandoned despite being a great deal complete and would possibly have been picked up again were it not for a 1926 storm that destroyed a large portion of the work that had been done. St. Peter’s was restored and is now the oldest Anglican church in the New World, but the Unfinished Church still sits, much as the name describes, unfinished. The structure has been crumbling for over a hundred years but is now a well-tended national landmark, albeit one that is totally unsafe. In fact the interior of the church is now closed to visitors due to safety concerns, although the exterior of this almost-was holy house can still be visited. Bus routes 1, 3, 10, and 11 go to St. George."
24,Spittal Pond Nature Reserve,"Smith's, Bermuda",Where a rare geological phenomenon created a section of rock that resembles a checkerboard.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/spittal-pond-nature-reserve,"You might not be able to play checkers at Spittal Pond Nature Reserve, but there is a checkerboard. Or, at least something that resembles one, thanks to a unique geological phenomenon. One of the highlights of Bermuda’s largest nature reserve is its rocky shore. A series of lines eroded into the limestone is a particularly peculiar attraction. Locals dubbed it “the Checkerboard” because of its familiar criss-crossing appearance. The lines are actually a rare geological phenomenon called tessellated pavement. Over time, when cracks or joints in a rock become eroded, it creates a unique effect that makes it look as though the land mysteriously transformed itself into a tile floor. The Checkerboard is made of limestone that cracked, weathered, and as a result, sprouted its signature squares. It’s likely stress from caves that once collapsed on the island also contributed to its unique appearance. In addition to the odd rocks, Spittal Pond Nature Reserve offers plentiful trails that wind through lush greenery. It’s also a great place for birdwatching."
25,Cooper's Island Nature Reserve,Bermuda,A tropical paradise once home to space exploration and military installations.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cooper-s-island,"Cooper’s Island in sunny Bermuda was used to house ammo bunkers and underground storage tanks during World War II. In 1960, NASA built a tracking station there to keep tabs on all the manned missions, which remained in operation through the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions. The eastern end of Cooper’s Island has become a wildlife refuge, open to the public and under active restoration since 2009. As of May 2013, one of the NASA radar towers has been converted into an ideal birdwatching station. Bermuda is home to a wide variety of marine life and seabirds, particularly the Tropic Longtail and the Bermuda Petrel, dolphins, humpback whales, and sea turtles. Parking is on the grass outside the gate. Dogs are restricted from the Nature Reserve. The beaches can be accessed through the pedestrian gate at the end of Turtle Beach. Reserve is accessible only by foot."
26,Somerset Bridge,Bermuda,The world's smallest drawbridge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/somerset-bridge,"At 22 inches wide the Somerset Bridge is said to be the world’s smallest drawbridge. The bridge is just wide enough for the mast of a well-sailed sail boat to pass through, although the ship will have to either have an appointment or wait for a kind passer by to help out by lifting the gate. Cranked open by hand in the past, the drawbridge is now two cantilevered half-spans, separated by a 18-inch gap connected by a wooden panel that needs to be removed by hand. The bridge is nearly 400 years old (built 1620) and has been featured on a 2009 series of Bermudian five dollar banknotes. A few nearby buildings share the Somerset name, in homage to the tiny, manpowered bridge.  In Sandys parish, connecting Somerset island with the mainland."
27,Admiralty House Park,Bermuda,"In Bermuda, this formal naval residence has become a go-to for cliff-jumpers and hikers.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/admiralty-house-park,"Located just two miles from Hamilton City is a remote cliff-jumping point with a unique history. Admiralty House was gifted to the British Royal Navy by the Bermuda Government back in the 1800s. Today, what’s left of the historic home is now surrounded by a park, hiking trails, and a hidden beach called Clarence Cove. Originally built for admirals who were stationed at the nearby dockyards, Admiralty House has had many lives, once serving as a Navy Hospital and as a signal center for the British Royal Navy during World War II. It was here that British officers would intercept coded messages from ships en route between the US and UK. When Admiralty House was built back in the 1800s, a nearby manmade cave—now known as Admiral’s Cave—once housed British convicts. In fact, there are several underground tunnels connecting underground caves, that were constructed in the 1800s by the British military. In 1951, Admiralty House was given back to the Bermuda government, abandoned and then eventually demolished. What is left are the remains of the once grand ballroom of this former naval outpost. By far, the biggest draw of Admiralty House today is its surrounding hiking trails, manmade caves, and cliff-jumping. A rocky path to Admiral’s Cave reveals a stairway leading to the open ocean. Visitors will opt to either jump into the inviting cerulean water from the stairs or jump off of the overhanging cliffs.  Admiralty House Park is open from sunrise to sunset daily and is free to enter. The park is visitor friendly, offering on-site portable toilets, picnic areas, hiking trails, a basketball court, and more. The park is located on Spanish Point Road, near the intersection of North Shore Road. It is advised visitors do not go to the park alone, after dark, as the evening hours can attract unsavory characters."
28,Royal Navy Docks,Bermuda,"Once a strategically imperative naval base, portions of this Bermuda dock complex now serve cruise ships.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-abandoned-royal-navy-docks-bermuda,"At the far northwestern end of the island of Bermuda lie the former dockyards of the Royal Navy. Once the most feared fighting fleet ever to sail the ocean, the gradual collapse of the British Empire during the 20th century saw the port’s usefulness fade away, until the 1950s, when the last ship sailed for England. The dockyard was abandoned in 1958. Following the loss of the American colonies after their defeat in the War of Independence, the island of Bermuda took on an increased importance for Great Britain. Faced with threats to their naval supremacy from both the burgeoning American fleet and marauding French privateers sent by Napoleon to cripple British trade in the New World, Bermuda was selected to become the new headquarters for the North America and West Indies Station of the Royal Navy. The Royal Navy immediately started pouring money into Ireland Island, the northwestern-most island in the Bermuda chain. Developing over 200 acres, it began building a giant dockyard and port, protected by a system of fortifications. Bermuda was where the immense Royal Navy could refit its ships, and be used as a base to protect its dominance in the Western Atlantic. The dockyard was built by slaves from the British colonies of the Caribbean, and by thousands of convicts shipped over from England, but principally Ireland: the forced labourers lived in appalling conditions on the sub-tropical colonial outpost. The importance of the new base was shown during the War of 1812, with the blockade of American ports being orchestrated out of Bermuda. When the Royal Navy, carrying an expeditionary force of 5,000 troops and Royal Marines, attacked Washington DC, setting fire to the White House, they sailed from the new Navy Dockyard on Ireland Island. It was from one of the Bermuda ships that prisoner Francis Scott Key wrote the Star Spangled Banner. The Royal Navy dockyard retained its strategic importance through the two World Wars; the protection of the trans-Atlantic convoys from the U-Boat wolf packs was organized from Bermuda. But devastated by both World Wars, and with its Empire drastically reduced, Britain found its influence in the Western Atlantic usurped by the United States. The once bustling and vital dockyard found itself surplus to requirements, and it was eventually left by the Royal Navy. Its status was reduced from Dockyard to Naval Base in 1951, and the dockyard facilities were mostly removed in 1958 (althouth still serving as a British Navy outpost until 1995). The physical plant was left abandoned to the turbulent weather conditions of the Atlantic after naval units were withdrawn. After 20 years of decay, a group of volunteers took over the keep, restoring the old fortifications as a home for a new Bermuda Maritime Museum. As tourism to the small colonial island grew, $50 million renovations transformed parts of the old dockyard into a complex of restaurants, shops, and a new dock for cruise ships to accompany the excellent museum. But large parts of the old dockyard, including the old victualing yard, remain untouched, as they were when the Royal Navy left. The victualing yard was comprised of a square, guarded by cannon and surrounded by warehouses, the former home of the Royal Navy stores. Run by the Board of Commissioners for the Victualing of the Navy, under the auspices of the Admiralty, it would have been stocked with enough provisions to send the fleet out for months at a time. Barrels of ship’s biscuit, salt beef, pease, lime juice, grog, beer, as well as livestock and grains were kept here. Other warehouses were home to Navy ordnance. If a ship of the line limped into port, its sails, masts and rigging ravaged by storms or enemy grapeshot, the yard was the first port of call for the ship’s Master. The northern end of the yard was home to the cooperage, where the thousands of barrels used to house the Navy stores were manufactured and maintained. Whilst some areas of the old dock have benefitted from restoration and have been reclaimed for tourism, large stretches have been left alone. The organization behind the development of the Dockyard, the West End Development Corporation, (WedCo, created by an act of the legislature in 1982) are looking for ways to restore the yard that will retain its historical importance. Andrew Dias, the WedCo General Manager, says “the worst thing that can happen to these structures is that they remain empty. At the same time we have to strike a balance with their history, and that’s not always easy.” Invitations for ideas to restore the rest of the Dockyard were requested in 2015, and proffered suggestions are being evaluated and worked as funds become available. In the meantime, many of the ship yards and lofts of what was once the world’s greatest Navy lie empty.  Most cruise ships that visit Bermuda dock in the royal navel dockyard.There is also ferry and bus services available to and from the city of Hamilton"
29,The Abandoned Royal Navy Commander's House,Bermuda,The abandoned Bermudian home of a British naval leader is surrounded by crumbling sporting fields and the graves of convicts.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-abandoned-royal-navy-commander-s-house-bermuda,"When the Royal Navy left its station in Bermuda in 1953, handing over 300 years of dominance in the Western Atlantic to the United States, it kept a small presence on the island. The historic, sprawling dockyards to the west on Ireland Island were left to ruin, but the venerable old navy maintained a token force behind, named HMS Malabar. For 40 years the small garrison force was run out of a now abandoned complex on the southern tip of Ireland Island North. The centerpiece of the outpost was a once grand home belonging to the Royal Navy Commanding Officer, Bermuda. Standing proudly on a bluff overlooking the ocean, the elegant white house featured a two-story wrap-around porch, club rooms, and extensive playing fields. The home is situated on the corner of Cockburn’s Cut, itself named after Vice-Admiral Sir George Cockburn, commander of the British forces in Bermuda, who not only had the distinction of burning the White House in 1814 but of conveying Bonaparte to his final exile on St. Helena. The grounds surrounding the once elegant home were made of limestone, most of which was quarried by slave and convict labor, to construct the larger dockyard to the north. The grounds of the Commander’s home were turned into playing fields for the sailors’ games of tennis, cricket, and football. A short distance further south is a small cemetery which was used to bury the convicts who died while building the dockyard. Rather than be executed in Britain, over 9,000 convicts were shipped to Bermuda, of whom 2,000 died amidst the horrific conditions endured. Despite the thousands of deaths, only 13 graves are marked here, of which only four are named. When the small garrison finally sailed to England for good in 1995, the former home of its commander was allowed to fall apart. The old playing fields, like the house overshadowing it, were also left to fall into disrepair. For a short time, they were home to the Ireland Island Rangers football team, who plied their trade in the second tier of Bermudan association football. But today the playing fields are also closed and forlorn. Of all the types of abandoned places, there is always something quite poignant about a decaying sporting venue. Where once the concrete flagstaffs would have clattered with the sound of studs on boots, signaling the beginning of a new football season, today the fields lie silent and overgrown. The goal nets have withered away, and the changing rooms shuttered closed against the volatile sub-tropical winds. Bermuda, once one of Britain’s most strategically important outposts, is filled with similar such abandoned buildings; the last remnants of the old Empire, which are slowly fading away on a small island, isolated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Update: Since Bermuda hosted the America’s Cup in 2017 this property has now been completely renovated."
30,The Royal Naval Cemetery,Bermuda,"The final resting place for Bermuda's British military, including a man who died of sunstroke.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-royal-naval-cemetery-bermuda,"Known as bucolically as “The Glade,” Bermuda’s small Royal Naval Cemetery holds the remains of British naval officers posted to Bermuda who died during the 19th and 20th centuries including victims of drowning, and sunstroke, but mostly yellow fever. Many of the soldiers who perished in mid-Atlantic battles during the World Wars, instead of being returned to their home countries, were simply buried on the nearby islands. The Royal Naval Cemetery in Bermuda was actually established before the docks it was meant to serve were even complete, almost as though it was a statement on the acceptance of death during wartime. In any event, before the large population of military men were buried in the cemetery, which in the beginning were open to all (except for convicts), an outbreak of yellow fever quickly began to fill up the plots. During World War II, a number of the soldiers who died in nearby engagements were buried in the naval cemetery as it transitioned to a private military burial ground. American forces would later lease some of the land on the island from the British government, but this cemetery stands as a reminder of who owned the land first. Bus routes 7 and 8 stop by the graveyard."
31,The Baths,"Spanish Town, British Virgin Islands",This huge pile of volcanic boulders hides a stunning network of secret grottoes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-baths-spanish-town-british-virgin-islands,"Strewn about a sun-drenched beach on Virgin Gorda Island are a number of massive boulders known collectively as “The Baths,” and hidden around and beneath these titanic rocks are a number of pools and grottoes waiting to be discovered by leisurely vacationers. The Virgin Islands are known for their scenic vacation spots but few are as unique and wondrous as The Baths. Huge rounded stones composed mainly of granite are piled up on top of each other at the Southern tip of Virgin Gorda, left there by volcanic shifting that deposited the great rocks and shaped them into their present shape. Thanks to the largely spherical shape of the boulders, they settled over one another imperfectly creating a short system of voids within the piles, many of which have partially filled with sea water, creating magical natural grottoes. The rest of Virgin Gorda is no slouch when it comes to beauty, either, with a number of golden beaches and even some abandoned industrial ruins. Unfortunately, such beautiful natural wonders could not stay hidden for long, and now the rocky maze of tidal ponds is a well known vacation destination. Yet no amount of gawking tourists and sunbathing beauties can ruin what is one of the most amazing natural phenomena anywhere on earth."
32,Anegada Conch Middens,"Anegada, British Virgin Islands",A mountain of conch shells created by centuries of fishermen.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/anegada-conch-middens,"On the East End of Anegada, the most remote and sprawling landmass in the British Virgin Islands, a 12-foot-high mountain range of conch shells—carbon-dated to the 13th century—serves as the sole visual reminder that indigenous people once hunted the turquoise waters of the Caribbean’s yachting capital. First appearing on charts in the 1600s, the mounds were at one time thought to be the “Indian burial grounds” that Anegadeans still speak of. The shells have been occasionally removed and burned for lime, with no trace of human remains found. It appears more likely that the shells, each with a hole cut in the tip to more easily remove the marine snail dwelling within, were tossed there to get them out of the way, the current not being strong enough to carry them off. The local theory, which science may support, posits that the fishermen began the pile—instead of scattering shells on the sea floor—to keep the live conch around, since they’ll naturally avoid places full of their dead brethren. In any case, even as the conch elsewhere in the Caribbean dwindles due to overfishing, the population in Anegada remains stable and continues to be the BVI’s bread (or fish) basket. Tour guides have begun motoring curious visitors to gawk at the mounds, accessible only by boat and keen local piloting skills. Fishermen continue to visit them to discard their daily catch, ensuring that even as the lower shells dissolve into the seabed the mounds themselves will remain."
33,Kodiak Queen,British Virgin Islands,Divers can encounter an abandoned warship encircled by a giant kraken submerged in the British Virgin Islands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kodiak-queen,"The Kodiak Queen is a decorated World War II Navy fuel barge previously named the YO-44. It is believed to be one of only five ships that survived the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. After being converted into a commercial fishing trawler and used for a few decades, it finally ended up abandoned in the British Virgin Islands. There it was waiting to be, most likely, picked apart for scrap metal. Instead, things took a very different turn after British photographer Owen Buggy came across the ship. Buggy approached his former boss, Sir Richard Branson, with an idea: to create an artificial reef and art exhibit out of the abandoned barge. An 80-foot-long sculpture of a kraken was built around the Kodiak Queen, made to look as if the sea monster was attacking the ship and dragging it into the deeps of the ocean. The art reef was then towed out into the bay and sunk in April of 2017. The sculpture and the Kodiak Queen both survived the massive hurricanes of that year, but were damaged in one of the biggest series of swells that’s ever occurred in the area. The whole ship was shifted about 30 feet, and the head of the kraken sculpture was damaged. Most of the tentacles are still wrapped around the ship, however, and the strange site is still a spectacular dive.  The Kodiak Queen is located in a bay just outside of Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands. It's possible to see by snorkeling, but divers will get a better experience of the sculpture."

Most people picture flames engulfing most of the underworld, when in fact, Hell is mostly covered in black limestone, tourists, and excessive kitsch. Poking out from its lush surroundings on Grand Cayman is a small patch no bigger than a soccer field of rough, black limestone formations referred to as Hell. Hell was created by salt and lime deposits over 24 million years, and the legend of its name’s origin is controversial. Some say locals believed the place was similar to Hell’s landscape. Others assert that a British general hunting in the area exclaimed “Oh hell,” when he missed a shot near the area. Whatever the history behind the name, the area has attracted huge numbers of visitors and fostered a blooming tourism industry. Men dressed as the devil roam the gift shop and Club Inferno serves as the location’s top watering hole. There is even a post office where you can send friends and relatives postcards from Hell. According to Wikipedia, “Hell can be quite busy as it is a stop for cruise ship tours.” Those planning a visit from nearby George Town should schedule their trip accordingly.

35,Bloody Bay Coral Wall,"Little Cayman, Cayman Islands",A glowing underwater cliff attracts marine life and divers in equal measure.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bloody-bay-coral-wall,"Little Cayman has a population of less than 170, and nearly everyone who lives there is associated with diving in one way or another and even among these connoisseurs Bloody Bay is the island’s most wondrous dive. Supposedly named for numerous pirate battles, the bay is best known for the incredible underwater drop not far from shore: a nearly vertical wall of coral 300 meters down. While this impressive expanse would be enough to attract divers from around the world, the coral here doubles down on the natural wonder with its natural bioluminescence. This coral is home to numerous bioluminescent creatures, most of which are microscopic. While many organisms use bioluminescence to distract prey or predators or to indicate willingness to mate, no one is really sure what the symbiotic benefit is for the coral. In addition to the near invisible organisms residing in the coral, the living rock also fluoresces. Fluorescence is often confused with bioluminescence, but while bioluminescence is light created by an organism, fluorescence requires an external source of light (like sunlight or blacklight).  Most coral are capable of one and Bloody Bay does both, making it one of the most colorful and otherworldly dives in the world. Diving is easy and popular here on Little Cayman and a night dive is easily arranged, but you’ll need sophisticated equipment to capture the full range of colors on display. However if you aren’t afraid of the dark, Bloody Bay may be one of the most impressive sights in the natural world."
36,Wreck of the Ten Sail,"Gun Bay, Cayman Islands",A massive maritime collision may have led to the myth of a resort island's strange financial status.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wreck-of-the-ten-sail,"At the East End of Grand Cayman, far from the island’s cruise ship terminal and financial centers, a simple memorial commemorates a maritime disaster that gave rise to a legend about the island’s tax free status. On the evening of February 7, 1794, a convoy of ten British ships en route from Jamaica met disaster on the treacherous reefs of Grand Cayman. The Royal Navy frigate HMS Convert led a group of nine merchant ships, six of which were bound for England, three for the United States. The Convert’s captain, John Lawford, went to bed on that evening believing he had already safely passed by Grand Cayman. Unbeknownst to Captain Lawford, during the night six ships in his convoy sailed ahead of the Convert on a course which sent them directly towards the Cayman reefs. At 3:00 AM, one of the ships fired a distress signal and Lawford returned to the deck to discover that his own ship was now bearing down on the reef as well. As Lawford attempted to change course another ship in the convoy collided with the Convert driving both vessels onto the reef where they quickly foundered. All ten ships in the convoy ultimately wrecked on the reef. As the passengers and crew struggled to survive amid the breaking waves, island residents from the East End and Boddentown, having heard the ships’ distress signals, paddled out to the reefs in canoes to attempt a rescue. In the darkness and pounding surf, the Caymanians saved 450 of the stranded souls. Amazingly, only six people lost their lives in the disaster. The heroism of the Caymanians in rescuing the English sailors and passengers fueled a legend that lingers to this day.  The story goes that one of the passengers rescued from the wrecked ships was a son of King George III. When the King learned of the island residents’ bravery, he decided to reward them by decreeing that the Cayman Islands would forever be free of taxation and war conscription. However, there is no record that any member of the royal family was on one of the ships or that the King ever issued such a decree. Yet the legend is commonly repeated to explain the island’s unique financial status. In 1994, on the 200th anniversary of the disaster, Queen Elizabeth II visited the island’s East End and dedicated a memorial to the six victims. On a cliff with a view looking out to the reef where the ships wrecked, a stone monument and plaque commemorate the event. Perched along the cliff adjacent to the monument are six small concrete blocks representing the unfortunate few souls the Caymanians were unable to rescue."

Based on the increasingly bizarre log entries found on the ship, it’s believed that due to sailing troubles he left the race and started reporting false positions, and eventually jumped overboard to drown. The ship then had several different owners, until it was left to decay in the Cayman Islands. Near the Kidco Dock, on the beach"

Stunning beaches, incredible snorkeling, and a thriving nightlife–throw in a few bank privacy laws and no direct income tax and voila! The fifth largest financial hub in the world and hot spot for the famous and wealthy. Alas, all is not well in paradise. The renowned tax haven also happens to be a nucleus of destructive hurricane activity. The small, flat island that hosts about two million tourists a year is extremely susceptible to heavy winds and rising sea levels. This factoid becomes particularly consequential in the face of devastating hurricanes that hit the island on average, every 2.2 years. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan submerged over 25% of Grand Cayman. Researchers estimate that over 80% of the island’s buildings were damaged in the hurricane. George Town’s incredibly resilient financial sector reopened with power only days after the hurricane struck. Impressive as it was, the recovery was criticized by many of the island’s less fortunate inhabitants who were left in the dark. However, the situation isn’t entirely obvious–Grand Cayman has more registered businesses than it has citizens. It seems the government was just serving the larger constituency."
39,Davinoff's Concrete Sculpture Garden,"Old Man Bay, Cayman Islands",Grand Cayman is home to a colorful sculpture garden filled with giant concrete animals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/davinoffs-concrete-sculpture-garden,"For those on Grand Cayman looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the island’s west side, a visit to Old Man Bay will bring solitude, quite and… concrete. Located snuggly between the main island’s North Side and East End, the private residence and concrete sculpture garden of David Quasis, aka Davinoff, seemingly appears out of nowhere. Drive too fast on the rural neighborhood road and you might miss it. Davinoff’s Concrete Sculpture Garden is home to a larger-than-life Blue Iguana (a species unique to the island), a giant crab and an octopus, among others. Most of the sculptures depict animals from around Grand Cayman, a place that Davinoff vacations in for part of the year. Quasis began the park in 1999 with the smaller sculptures and then gradually introduced larger sculptures to the park. On average, it took him about seven weeks to construct some of the larger all-concrete sculptures. Made on one concrete slab, the sculptures are coated in a mix of cement/sand mortar and weigh an average of 1,000 to 2,000 pounds.  Although the sculpture garden is located on private property, it is open to the public. The sculpture garden is right along the roadside and admission is free. Though visitors are welcome and encouraged, please obey the signs and park in designated areas."
40,Temple Beth Shalom,Cayman Islands,"This tiny, charming synagogue in the Cayman Islands was built by a man as a present for his Jewish wife.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/temple-beth-shalom,"You might not expect to find a synagogue in the Cayman Islands, where the population is almost exclusively Protestant. Yet nestled amidst the lovely gardens behind the Mango Manor inn is one of the smallest and most charming Jewish temples around. The Jewish population of Cayman Brac is comprised of just a few members, including the couple who built this synagogue with their own hands. Lynne met George Walton in college. She was an Ashkenazi Jew from Brooklyn and he was a “Bracker,” a native of Cayman Brac, descended from one of the early families with Sephardic roots. The two married and traveled the world. After George retired from 20 years of Air Force service, the couple returned to Cayman Brac and opened a bed and breakfast. The Caymans are very Christian and there was no place for Jewish worship on Cayman Brac. George wanted his wife to have a spiritual home, so in 2002 he built her a synagogue in the garden. Temple Beth Shalom is humble, but not shabby in the slightest. The round white building stands out against the blue Caribbean sky. George laid pearl granite floors and Italian marble beams. Lynne carved the heavy mahogany doors, which read, “HOUSE OF WELCOME, MAY ALL WHO ENTER HERE FIND PEACE.” The domed ceiling is painted like a starry sky, with 12 lanterns representing the 12 tribes of Israel. Over the years the couple has collected important Jewish artifacts, including a Byzantine oil lamp given to them by the British Commonwealth Jewish Council for their work in promoting Judaism in the Caymans. Services are held most every Friday, with Lynne often acting as lay rabbi unless someone more learned is present. Even if there are visiting rabbis and cantors, she still plays a mean shofar and delights in giving tours of the synagogue her husband built for her. Temple Beth Shalom has also become a sort of community and events center, hosting island weddings as well as orchestral concerts, AA meetings, etc. The tiny synagogue has established Cayman Brac as a popular destination for vacationing Jews, but as the door’s inscription suggests, people of all faiths are welcome."
41,Ugland House,"George Town, Cayman Islands",There is one corporation registered for every three square feet of space in this inconspicuous office building.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ugland-house,"In 2015, American multinational corporations held an estimated $2.5 trillion in overseas tax havens, more than the GDP of the entire country of France. These tax havens are scattered across the globe, and one of the largest is inconspicuously situated in a five-story office building in the city of George Town in the Cayman Islands. There are nearly 100,000 corporate entities worldwide that use the Cayman Islands’ 0% tax rate to dodge corporate taxes, a number higher than the territory’s population itself. These thousands of corporations could together form a miniature city or a major financial district, but in fact thousands of their offices have the exact same address. The Ugland House in George Town covers a mere 10,000 square feet of land, but is simultaneously the official home of a whopping 18,857 corporate entities. Spanning just five stories, there is one corporation registered for every three square feet of space in the Ugland House. As President Barack Obama has remarked, “either this is the largest building in the world or the largest tax scam in the world.”"
42,Fusterlandia,"Havana, Cuba",A Cuban artist reclaimed his impoverished neighborhood as a dreamy folk art kingdom.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fusterlandia,"Cuban artist José Fuster’s art is “naïve,” meaning he uses childlike crude shapes and bright colors in his untrained composition. His work has been compared to that of Picasso, a comparison that followed him in successful gallery tours across Europe. After one such tour, Fuster was struck with a desire to recreate something like Gaudi’s public works in Barcelona and Brâncuși’s across Romania in his own homeland. He wanted to put his artistic reality into his real-world surroundings, and he began in his own neighborhood. In 1975, after moving into a modest wood house in the rundown neighborhood of Jaimanitas outside Havana, Fuster set about decorating his studio in colorful mosaic. Once he was done there, he asked his neighbors if he could decorate their homes and business as well. A few accepted his offer and the tile creations grew. Over the course of a decade, doctors’ offices, bus stops, fountains, benches, gateways, and more were enveloped by Fuster’s whimsical imagination. Today, his artwork coats the neighborhood in a rainbow of strange, enchanting fantasy. Jaimanitas was an economically depressed area before Fuster arrived, and now it has turned into an artist’s paradise. Tourists are bussed into the neighborhood to admire Fuster’s still-growing kingdom, which has spawned a new generation of artists inspired by the surroundings they came up in.  Taxi from downtown Havana (about CUC$20 unless you are a better negotiator than me), or regular local bus (MN$0.80, or about 1/500th of the taxi fare, if you are adventurous enough) - it just off Avenida 5ta and even the bus-stops are Gaudi-esque. I think one of the hop-on-hop-off tour buses goes to the area too, and some regular tours of Havana go there. It is in the Jaimanitas area, not at the spot marked on the map as Playa Jaimanitas, but a few blocks south towards the main road (you might have to scroll the map a little to see it). There is no charge, but Fuster and his neighbors (many of whom have become artists as a result of his work) will surely appreciate you buying any of their works, small or large."
43,Discoteca Ayala,"Trinidad, Cuba",This subterranean disco dance club in a Cuban cave comes with bright lights and a dark legend.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/discoteca-ayala,"In the colonial city of Trinidad, Cuba, the nightlife is underground. As in, 100 feet under the earth, in an actual cave. Disco Ayala, also known La Cueva, is a dance club built into a natural cave, an unlikely union of Top 40 dance hits and naturally formed stalactites. It also was once the home of an infamous serial killer. La Cueva (“The Cave”) is a favorite weekend spot for locals and the venturesome tourists that get wind of it by word of mouth. The cavernous disco is located on the northern outskirts of town, about a 10-minute walk up a hill away from the center of Trinidad, an old Spanish colony that feels even more preserved in time than the rest of Cuba. Two hundred miles from the bustle of Havana, horses still trot down the narrow cobblestone streets of sleepy Trinidad, a Caribbean coastal town founded by Spanish explorers in the 1500s that rose to prominence as Cuba’s sugar economy boomed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The historic town is an unlikely setting for one of the world’s most bizarre discos. As you approach La Cueva, the first curious thing you’ll notice is there’s no noise at all coming from the club. It’s not until you walk through the gated entrance, descend down a long flight of stairs and through a tunnel into the jagged cavity that the dance floor opens up and the music starts blaring. The second thing you’ll notice is that it’s very hot. You’re in the Caribbean after all, dancing in a throng of a thousand people. In a cave. Inside, the scene is marvelously unique, if somewhat tacky. A mix of techno and salsa music explodes from the speakers, while videos of spring breakers and Cuban dancers play on suspended screens above the crowded floor. Stalactites and stalagmites surround the room, illuminated by colored lights. Rumor has it the staff has to smoke out the bats from the cave before the club opens at 10 pm each night. A few CUC will get you admission plus a free drink from the bar, a hole carved out of the natural stone. This is Cuba; make it a mojito. As if cave-dwelling bats and disco lights isn’t a strange enough juxtaposition, the cave was also once home to a notorious serial killer: Carlos “Coco” Ayala, who legend has it would abduct children and murder them in this very cave. According to the oral histories, Ayala was a deserter from the Cuban War of Independence in the late 1800s, and went into hiding underground where he committed unspeakable crimes. As myth and truth have blurred over the years, the killer has become a popular figure in Cuban culture—generations of parents have warned their children to be good or else Carlos Ayala will get you.  Meanwhile, the decision to name the club after the cave’s murderous former inhabitant remains a mystery.  From Trinidad center, walk up a path leading directly behind the cathedral, off Juan Manuel Márquez, or take the longer route from Hotel Las Cuevas.

44,Colón Cemetery,"Havana, Cuba","In terms of history and architecture, this is one of the most remarkable cemeteries in the world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/colon-cemetery,"When you think of world-class cemeteries, places like Paris, London, New Orleans, or Buenos Aires might come to mind. But this cemetery in the heart of Havana is as stately and impressive as any of the more familiar “haunts” (sorry). Established in 1876, the Cementerio de Cristóbal Colón was named after Christopher Columbus and designed by a Madrid-educated Galician architect by the name of Calixto Arellano de Loira y Cardoso. Built around a central chapel that was loosely modeled after the Florence Cathedral (aka “Il Duomo”), the 150-acre cemetery is laid out in a grid of main central avenues and smaller side streets. As planned by Loira, the layout organizes the occupants of the cemetery according to their rank and social status, with the wealthy and well-connected occupying prominent spots on main thoroughfares while more lowly individuals (such as the condemned, victims of epidemics, and “pagans”) are relegated to the “suburbs.” Colón Cemetery contains over 500 major mausoleums, chapels, and family vaults, with styles running from renaissance to neoclassical to art deco. In addition to the countless stunning examples of funerary architecture, unique sites include: an elaborate 75-foot-tall memorial for firefighters who died in a disastrous citywide fire in 1890; mausolea for various trade and professional organizations (such as the Workers Society of La Tropical Brewery); special monuments dedicated to two baseball players, a chess champion (shaped like a white king piece), and a dedicated domino player (shaped like a double-three domino); and the burial sites of a remarkable number of poets, filmmakers and musicians, including Ibrahim Ferrer Planas of the original Buena Vista Social Club. One can also find here and there abandoned and unmaintained tombs and chapels of families now living in exile. The very first occupant of Colón Cemetery was the architect Loira himself, who died before the project was finished. Currently, the cemetery holds over 800,000 graves and included a million interments. This of course means that space for this still-operational cemetery is a premium, so typically remains are removed after three years to be boxed up and put in storage (yes, you read that correctly) in order to make room for new interments."
45,Callejon de Hamel,"Havana, Cuba",A colorful narrow alley in Cuba is full of street art and sculptures made of found objects.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/callejon-de-hamel,"Callejon de Hamel is a narrow alley in Havana filled with lively colorful murals and sculptures made from bathtubs, hand pumps, and pinwheels. It offers visitors to Cuba’s capital a taste of the city’s local art. Cuban artist Salvador Gonzáles Escalona describes his Afro-Cuban style as a mix of surrealism, cubism, and abstract art. After spending more than two decades producing artworks in Cuba, as well as the U.S., Norway, Italy, and Venezuela, the self-taught artist began adorning the alley outside his apartment with art in 1990. After filling the alley, which stretches for about two blocks, with mosaics, paintings, and sculptures, including a throne that bestows good luck and a bench made of old bathtubs, his works started spilling out onto street and up the sides of the buildings. The area was once rather desolate, but the colorful street now provides an eccentric backdrop for musicians and rumba dancers who entertain the increasing crowds of tourists and locals. Sunday afternoon rumba sessions are popular with tourists. A local children’s art program meets in the alley. The surrounding Cayo Hueso neighborhood once had a dangerous reputation, but Salvador’s art has helped to change perceptions of the area. Map the alley before you go because internet access in Cuba is iffy. The alley is located about a 15-minute walk east of the Hotel Nacional."
46,Coppelia,"Havana, Cuba","Castro's communist ice cream mothership has been serving five-scoop ""salads"" for over 50 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/coppelia,"In Cuba, you don’t have to look far to find an ice cream joint. But the aging citadel of cold confections known as Coppelia is the Alpha and Omega of the Cuban ice cream craze. Commissioned by Fidel Castro in an effort to bring the tasty phenomenon to his people, the sprawling, retro-modern helado complex has seen better days, but it continues to serve up thousands of scoops every day. Located in Havana, Coppelia was originally built in 1966 at the behest of Castro himself, who was notoriously interested in dairy products and sought to produce more quality flavors of ice cream than America. In truly grandiose fashion, the ice cream compound was erected on the site of an old hospital in the bustling Vedado district and designed to look like a sort of UFO, with long concrete spokes radiating from the top of the structure, surrounded by a park and assorted seating covering an entire city block. Coppelia was named after a 19th century comedy ballet by Celia Sánchez, Castro’s secretary and close confidant, who took charge of the project. Never has a communist dream of eating ice cream in the bowels of a stylized spaceship been more fully realized. In the early days, Coppelia offered 26 different flavors including such heady delights as orange-pineapple, coconut with almonds, and muscatel. Flavors were often mixed and matched in multi-scoop sundaes their eager customers couldn’t get enough of. Coppelia continued to grow and other locations opened around the country, but the central mothership never lost its iconic appeal. Over the years, the political tides have altered Coppelia’s offerings in different ways, as the price and availability of ingredients wax and wane, but through it all, the site has survived, becoming a “people’s park.” In the 1990s when trade fluctuations meant the country had to decide between dairy resources for butter or ice cream, ice cream won out. Coppelia still serves thousands of scoops each day to the hordes of people lined up for an “ensalada” (five scoops in a bowl), many of whom order more than one. According to some modern accounts, the number of flavors on offer are usually around three (of varying quality), down from the 50 or so offered during the shop’s heyday. Yet that hasn’t slowed Coppelia’s popularity. For all of the political, social, and economic influences on Coppelia’s significance, the simple truth is: Cuba’s hot, and ice cream’s not."
47,Los Jardines de la Tropical,"Havana, Cuba",A Spanish-style estate that has traded black ties for rock concerts.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/los-jardines-de-la-tropical,"All of the great parties in Havana could not stop Los Jardines de la Tropical from falling into a picturesque state of decay. Built in the late 1800s by the Herrera family, owners of La Tropical brewery, this Cuban pleasure garden is now a somewhat abandoned gem on the outskirts of Havana. Meant to mirror a lush Spanish estate, the Tropical Gardens, as the site is known in English, was built around 1912 and quickly became a hot spot for high society and the most popular orchestras of the time. In its prime, the grounds were scattered with waterfalls, gazeboes, and a small palace in the style of the Alhambra in Granada. There was also a huge ballroom capable of entertaining around 500 amorous couples. As the popularity of the lush social space waned, the structures fell into disrepair and many of the extravagant flourishes throughout the garden became overgrown. The site was partially refurbished and a number of different ventures including nightclubs and restaurants tried to bring the gardens back into favor but none of them stuck. Now the Los Jardines de la Tropical belongs to the Havana Metropolitan Parks organization and efforts are underway to preserve the verdant tropical history of the site. Frequent rock concerts and dance festivals are held on the grounds, so while the tuxedoes and finery may have disappeared, the parties rage on."
48,Presidio Modelo,"Nueva Gerona, Cuba",A series of five defunct panopticon prisons in Cuba.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/presidio-modelo,"Built between 1926 and 1928, the Presidio Modelo was designed to be a model prison by President-turned-Dictator Gerardo Machado. Each building is a circle of prison cells surrounding a center watchtower. The idea behind the design was that the watchtower would be darkened making it impossible for the inmates to tell if they were being watched. This would cause a sense of invisible omniscience. Fidel Castro, his brother Raul, and other survivors of the rebel attacks on Moncado Barracks were housed in these particular panopticons, which were designed to hold up to 2,500 prisoners. With Castro’s rise, the Presidio Modelo was used to hold political dissidents, homosexuals, Jehovah’s Witnesses, counter-revolutionaries, and any other “enemies” to the dictator. The population quickly ballooned to more than 6,000 inmates. Riots broke out in the prisons in 1961 due to overcrowding, and in 1966 they were permanently closed by the Cuban government. Today, the buildings remain open as a museum and national monument. The old administration building functions as a school and research center."

Encompassing 11 acres, the square was conceived by the French Urbanist Jean Claude Frostier and built on the Loma de los Catalanes hill during the Batista era. Until 1959 it was known as Plaza Civica, but following the Cuban Revolution the plaza was renamed by Fidel Castro. The vast Plaza de la Revolución is surrounded by grey administrative buildings that today house some of the most important offices of Cuba’s vast governmental bureaucracy. Huge political rallies are held in the area and the Castro brothers, along with the other leaders of the Cuban government, have addressed millions of Cubans from the square. The square is dominated to the north by the Jose Marti Memorial, which predates the revolution. A 109-meter-tall tower built from gray granite stones stands in front of the Palace of Revolution, the seat of the Cuban Government. The National Library, Cuba’s largest, and several other important government buildings are also located in the vicinity. Arguably one of the most iconic images in Cuba is a giant mural of Cuba’s revolutionary hero Ernesto “Che” Guevara. The can be found on the eastern facade of the Ministerio del Interior, a grey concrete monolith situated to the northern side of the plaza. The steel sculpture is modeled in the likeness of Che’s 1960 iconic photograph captured by Alberto Koda — the very same one to be found in every backpacker hangout the world over. Below, you can see his most famous utterance “Hasta La Victoria Siempre.” (“Always onwards onto victory”).  At night, the mural is lit from behind with a golden glow that is said to symbolize the spirit of Cuba’s revolution. In 2009, Che’s mural gained a companion. A portrait of Camilo Cienfuegos was installed on the adjacent Telecommunications Building with the words “Va Bien, Fidel” emblazoned below. The Plaza de la Revolución is the administrative focal point of Cuba — the buildings, ministries and governmental divisions that operate from the plaza form an integral part of present-day Cuba. When Pope Jean Paul II had held Mass in the Plaza back in January 1998, nearly a million Cubans congregated at the location. The plaza captures the raw spirit and heritage of Cuba. A few memorials and sculptures like the contemplative man in front of the Jose Marti Memorial and the Monumento El Legado Cultural Hispánico behind the National Library capture the varied and long cultural heritage of the Communist nation. A trip to the country would be incomplete without visiting this square. Adapted with Permission from Andy of Go Apocalypse."
50,Hotel Nacional de Cuba,"Havana, Cuba","Once a favorite playground for the world's most illustrious guests, Hotel Nacional's secret weapons and bunkers reveal a more menacing side to its golden history.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hotel-nacional-de-cuba,"Long ranked among the world’s finest hotels, the Hotel Nacional de Cuba had been a playground for the upper crust of society when life was golden, and survived wars both real and threatened – with relics to prove it. Built in 1930 and operated by Americans until the Cuban Revolution of 1959, its eclectic architectural mishmash of Art Deco, Moorish, and neo-colonial styles distinguised the hotel from its Caribbean contemporaries. Glamorous guests arrived immediately and haven’t stopped since. Its guestbook reads like a who’s-who of superstars from all walks of culture; few places on Earth can claim to have hosted Mickey Mantle, Ernest Hemingway, Yuri Gagarin, Jean Paul Sartre, Naomi Campbell, and Jesse Ventura. Perhaps most notorious of all, the hotel played host to a mob summit of the Cosa Nostra families in 1946, which Francis Ford Coppola would later dramatize in The Godfather: Part II. Glamor and mafia aside, the Hotel Nacional had always been chased by a darker reality that remains palpable to this day. From colonial powers, unaffiliated pirates, and nuclear terror, the hotel seemed destined to be under siege. Two giant cannons used in costal defense remain on prominent display, reminding visitors that the hotel was constructed atop the site of the 18th century Santa Clara Battery. Daily historic tours of the hotel touch on more delicate, recent history in the form of broad mentions of a nuclear bunker on premises, dating back to 1962 when Hotel Nacional served as Fidel Castro’s headquarters for aerial defense during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Around this time, anti-aircraft machinery was installed on the lawn and reinforced trenches were dug beneath the gardens, traces of which still dot the grounds. With over eighty years of the good life and skirmishes under its belt, the Hotel Nacional is now a state-sanctioned national monument where people from all walks of life can book a night or two to commune with the giants of history, no matter which version you prefer."
51,Viaje Fantástico,"Havana, Cuba",No one knows the meaning behind this giant sculpture of a nude woman with a fork riding a rooster in Havana.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/viaje-fantastico,"There’s a mysterious brass statue in Havana’s Plaza Vieja. A woman sits atop her big, feathery mount, her voluptuous form completely naked except for the stilettos on her feet. A massive forks rests on her right shoulder. The rooster, ever so stoic, gazes ahead. No one knows the meaning behind the puzzling sculpture. The piece is called Viaje Fantástico, so perhaps she’s heading off on an adventure to some sort of nudist dinner party. Or, as some online theories speculate, it could have a more sexual connotation given the rooster’s association with male genitalia. Or, maybe, it’s just a figure of the sculptor’s imagination and has no greater symbolism at all. Recent tour guides have suggested it is meant as a tribute to the long history of prostitution in Havana. The nude woman is earning her meals (fork and chicken) by selling herself. Yet, she is unabashed by this behavior, as seen in the defiant look on her face. Roberto Fabelo installed the nugget of art in Plaza Vieja in 2012 without explanation or context. The artist, who won the country’s 2004 National Arts Award, frequently features nude women with birdlike appearances in his work.

The town gained it’s significance on January 27, 1924, the day of Lenin’s funeral in Moscow, when thousands of local Cuban people gathered on the hill on the outskirts of town to pay tribute to the former soviet leader. The events on the hill —formerly called Loma del Fortin — inspired the socialist mayor of Regla, Antonio Bosch, to rename the hill Colina Lenin, and he planted an olive tree to commemorate the late leader. It was the first monument to honor Lenin built outside of the USSR. Over the following years, the Colina Lenin was the stage for numerous demonstrations against some of the oppressive Cuban governments and dictatorships. The site was attacked many times, but there was particularly violent day in 1930 when during a demonstration, protesters were attacked by soldiers of President Gerardo Machado and the olive tree was cut down. (A new olive tree was planted before long.) Sixty years after the death of Lenin, in 1984, a bronze sculpture of Lenin’s face created by the Cuban artist Thelma Marin was added to the site, and can still be seen there today. Surrounding the bronze sculpture are twelve white human figures, symbolizing solidarity with the October Revolution in Russia. Today the site is a national monument of the Republic of Cuba, and there is a museum on the site detailing much of the history of the area. Adapted with Permission from Andy of Go Apocalypse.

The 15-acre property was originally built in 1886 just outside of Havana. Hemingway purchased the home for himself and his third wife in 1939 and he would live in the residence until 1960, just one year prior to his death. The colorful writer filled the home with letters, big game trophies from his African hunting trips, books, and cats to make himself feel at home. It was during this time that the author took an interest in breeding cats, leading to the population of six-toed mutant cats still found at his home in Florida. During his time in the Cuban villa, Hemingway also wrote a great deal of his masterpiece For Whom The Bell Tolls, about the Spanish Civil War, and penned the entirety of The Old Man and the Sea, for which he would go on to earn a Pulitzer Prize and a Nobel Prize for Literature. The vibrant Cuban culture and inviting climes at Finca Vigía seemed to do the author well. After Hemingway’s suicide in 1961, the house was preserved in his memory but began to fall into disrepair in the 1990s. In 2005 Finca Vigía was restored via an unprecedented collaboration between US and Cuban organizations. The home is now known as the Museo Ernest Hemingway and the home is preserved as it was when Hemingway lived in it. The museum features such items as unpublished writings, his original typewriter, and even his fishing boat, Pilar, which inspired his Pulitzer Prize-winning novella."
54,Bacardi Building,"Havana, Cuba","After the Cuban Revolution, the famous rum company had to leave their swanky headquarters behind.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bacardi-building,"In 1930, the Bacardi rum company opened a new headquarters: a gorgeous Art Deco building on the edge of Old Havana. In 1960, Bacardi left Cuba after the newly installed revolutionary government confiscated their Cuban assets, including the aforementioned headquarters that by then was a prominent landmark in the capital city. Bacardi was founded in Santiago de Cuba in 1862, taking advantage of Cuba’s status as largest producer of sugar in the Caribbean to launch what would eventually become perhaps the most recognizable brand of rum in the world. The early decades of the 20th century were boom times for Cuba and Bacardi alike, with World War I making the sugar trade particularly lucrative and Prohibition in the U.S. making Havana a popular party destination for American tourists. These flush times led to a good deal of new construction in Havana, much of it in the Art Deco style that was wildly popular at the time. The Bacardi Building is regarded as a signature masterpiece of Havana Deco and is likewise considered to be one of the finest Art Deco buildings in Latin America. At the time of its completion, the 12-story Bacardi Building was Havana’s first skyscraper and for decades thereafter continued to be the city’s tallest building and one of its principal landmarks. Characterized by a facade of red granite, golden glazed tiles, brass fixtures, and colorful terracotta reliefs of nude nymphs designed by Maxfield Parrish, the building terminates in a stepped, ziggurat-inspired tower topped with a bronze rendition of Bacardi’s bat logo. The bat motif can also be found throughout the building’s richly decorated interior, along with familiar Art Deco details such as geometric patterns, natural imagery, rich wood paneling, and mural paintings. In 2003, the Office of the City Historian of Havana completed renovated the building to put some shine back in its Roaring 20s splendor. Although it is still used as an office building (primarily for tour operators) and thus not generally open to the public, visitors can see the lower floors as well as a little-known mezzanine bar that was once the private watering hole of the Bacardi family. You cannot, however, order a Bacardi at the Bacardi Building bar, as the company is still engaged in an intense trademark dispute (aka the “Rum Wars”) with the Cuban government involving intellectual property (particularly the “Havana Club” brand) confiscated after the revolution.

This project was never completed and the work was abandoned in 1992 with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the termination of Soviet economic aid to Cuba. The original plan was to produce two 440 megawatts reactors, expected to cover 15% of Cuba’s energy needs, which was heavily dependent on imported oil. The US strongly opposed the project due to its close proximity to the Florida Keys. Today, one can observe the huge facilities, including the dome, which can be seen from as far as Cienfuegos.

Cuban authorities considered the music “ideological diversionism,” and decadent American influence during a time of revolution. Young Cubans intrigued by the cultural revolution happening in the U.S. and Europe could sense what they were being denied access to, but could get only a small taste of the 60s by quietly listening to smuggled Beatles tapes in dark rooms. Twenty years after John Lennon’s death, Castro made a complete 180; no longer was his music banned, instead Lennon was to be celebrated as a hero. Castro unveiled a shiny new bronze statue of Lennon in the new John Lennon Park, screened a documentary on Lennon shot by his personal cinematographer, and organized a Lennon tribute concert in 2000. The reason for honoring this musical icon? “I share his dreams completely. I too am a dreamer who has seen his dreams turn into reality.” Lennon was also harassed by the US government in the later years of his life, and Cuba considers him a rebel and a victim; a kindred spirit to Cuba’s relationship with the US. While the glasses have been stolen and vandalized off his face, a security guard at the park who sometimes sits on the bench with Lennon will reportedly put the glasses on the statue if you ask him. On Obscura Day - March 20th, 2010 - Obscuraphiles gathered at John Lennon Park in Havana, Cuba.  In the John Lennon Park, the statue is on one of the benches of the park, nearer the corner of streets 17th and 6th."
57,Che Guevara Mausoleum,"Santa Clara, Cuba",This imposing memorial contains the remains of Che Guevara — and 29 other guerrillas who died with him in Bolivia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/che-guevara-mausoleum,"Standing high on a hill overlooking the city, a soaring bronze statue of Che Guevara bears witness to the status of Santa Clara, Cuba as the “city of Che.” The city was the site of the last conflict of the Cuban Revolution. Fulgencio Batista’s last attempt to retain power was disrupted by forces commanded by Guevara, who derailed an armored train carrying ammunition, heavy weapons, and 300 soldiers. Ultimately overrunning the city’s demoralized defensive forces, the revolutionaries achieved ultimate victory with Batista’s flight from Cuba a mere 12 hours after the Battle of Santa Clara. In recognition of this historic event, the boxcars remain in their derailed configuration even unto this day, with the bulldozer used to rip up the train tracks standing triumphantly nearby. To further commemorate the battle, the Cuban government began construction on a Guevara memorial in Santa Clara in 1982. Officially opened on December 28, 1988, the memorial included the aforementioned statue, a museum detailing the life of Guevara, and an expansive tiled parade ground. What it did not initially include, however, was a mausoleum. This is because Guevara had died in Bolivia in 1967, executed by Bolivian military forces after leading an ill-fated and poorly-managed insurgency in the South American country. His body had been dumped in an unmarked mass grave, where it remained undiscovered until 1997. His remains were identifiable due to, among other things, his hands; they were missing, having been amputated from his corpse 30 years prior and sent to Buenos Aires for fingerprint identification to verify that the executed rebel was indeed the famous Che Guevara. His remains — along with those of six other guerrillas found in the same grave — were returned to Cuba and buried with military honors on October 17, 1997, all under the memorial that had already been built for Guevara ten years previously. Subsequent excavations in Bolivia have brought an additional 23 combatants’ remains to rest in the starkly rectilinear memorial to Guevara. Visitors are forbidden from bringing any personal effects into the complex. The museum includes Guevara’s rifle (a .30-cal M2 carbine), medical certificates, field binoculars, and water bottle, as well as pictures of the revolutionary smoking cigars and playing golf."
58,Klein Curaçao,"Willemstad, Curaçao","Shipwrecks, ruins, and turtles are all that remain on this haunting Caribbean ghost island.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/klein-curacao,"After two hours sailing, bearing southeast from the old Dutch Caribbean outpost of Curaçao, travelers can find an abandoned island. Called Klein Curaçao (Dutch for “little”), it is a ghostly island that has been uninhabited for generations. Measuring just over half a square mile in size, the silent, flat coral atoll is home only to a deserted lighthouse, the shipwrecks of vessels it failed to save, several collapsed ancient stone buildings, and a burial site. Whilst many desert islands bring to mind tropical paradises, Klein Curaçao is a haunting, windswept place. The lighthouse, once painted a vibrant coral pink, was built in 1850. Standing alone in the centre of the island, it is now abandoned. The wooden stairs to the top of the lighthouse are still intact, as are the two stories of rooms that housed the lighthouse keepers; with no natural source of running water, it must have been a desolate place to live and work. In 1888 the German Navy attempted to build a base here as part of the hoped for Imperial colonization of the Deutsche Karibik, but were driven off by the windswept conditions of the remote outpost when a tropical storm swept away the first foundations of a wharf. Klein Curaçao neatly highlights the effects of the nature on the island. The northern side is a tropical paradise of palm trees, white beaches, and crystal waters. The southern, windward side, more exposed to the elements, is an unforgiving shoreline of pounding surf, and ragged coral reefs. Here lie the shipwrecks of Klein Curaçao. Looming on the southern beach is the hulking rusted remains of the oil tanker Maria Bianca Guidesman, which ran aground here in the 1960s. Gradually being eroded away by the merciless waters of the Caribbean sea, already half of the tanker has sheared off and washed away. Next to the Maria Bianca is the remnants of a once glorious 30 foot luxury boat cruelly smashed against the sharp coral reefs. Dotting much of the island are crumbling stone structures that looked like simple dwellings, perhaps once home to passing fishermen. On the northeastern end there is also a simple burial site, marked by a bleached plain wooden cross without a name. Today, day trips are offered by several companies operating out of neighboring Curaçao that sail to the island by catamaran. A visit to Klein Curaçao is a visit to a remote, ghostly island, surrounded by waters where for many years the principal profession was piracy. And where all you will have for company are shipwrecks, turtles, lizards, and a beautifully faded pink lighthouse, gradually falling into ruin. Two hours sail south east from Curacao.

59,The Abandoned Pietermaai Mansions,"Willemstad, Curaçao",The mouldering manses of wealthy colonials still pock the streets of a Curaçao neighborhood.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-abandoned-pietermaai-mansions-willemstad-curacao,"The island of Curaçao in the southern Caribbean sea was colonized by the Dutch West India Company in 1634. With no natural gold deposits, the small island had been passed over by other European naval powers, but the Dutch found it an ideal base for their burgeoning slave trade with Africa. Building the capital city of Willemstad in the natural bay of St. Anna, the colony soon prospered. The Dutch lined the inner harbour with brightly painted buildings that mirrored the architecture of Amsterdam. Prior to the slave trade, the principal business of the Caribbean was piracy, so the Company ringed the city with forts. As the colony prospered and grew, the walled city could no longer contain enough housing, so a narrow strip of land bordering the sea was developed into a residential district. Named Pietermaai, the new neighborhood was set aside for the wealthier merchants, bankers and ships captains of the Dutch West India Company. In addition to colonial mansions along wide breezy boulevards, it was littered with theaters and fine restaurants. After the Dutch abolished slavery in 1863 the colony’s fortunes began to fade until oil was discovered in 1914 and the Royal Dutch Shell company built a refinery. As the refinery, located on the northern side of the Willemstad harbour, prospered, the exclusive Pietermaai district’s fortunes began to wane. By the end of the 20th century, with the merchants and bankers of the West India Company long since departed, the colonial mansions began to crumble and fall into neglect. The once fashionable neighbourhood steadily fell into ruin. But within the last 10 years the Pietermaai has begun to show signs of revival. As tourism began to increase, many of the colorful mansions have been restored into boutique hotels, diving centers, and restaurants. But many of the buildings remain dilapidated, living side by side with the newer developments. A local initiative has seen many of the empty buildings set aside as giant canvases for local artists. The crumbling plasterwork is now painted over with giant murals, many of which depict the slave trade which once characterized the colony. A walk through the Pietermaai neighbourhood is filled with beautifully faded mansions, covered with wild tropical flowers, through which the original coral pinks and pastel blue plaster work can still be seen. Once home to the wealthy merchants and ship captains of a colonial trading company long since disappeared into history, today the boulevards are undergoing a steady and colorful renaissance."
60,Mikvé Israel-Emanuel Synagogue,"Willemstad, Curaçao",The floor of the oldest surviving synagogue in the Americas is entirely covered in sand.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mikve-israelemanuel-synagogue,"Mikvé Israel-Emanuel Synagogue—often referred to as the Snoa, another term for synagogue—is the oldest surviving synagogue and Jewish congregation in the Americas. This is more than enough to make it a place of historical significance but it has another element that makes it unusual. The floor is entirely covered in sand. Founded in Curaçao in 1651, the congregation’s original name translates to The Hope of Israel. The Mikvé Israel-Emanuel Synagogue itself began construction in 1729, was completed in 1732, and has been in continuous use ever since. The synagogue is tucked into a quiet street in the Punda neighborhood of Willemstad, the historic capital city of Curaçao. Though it has an inconspicuous exterior, once you step inside, you’ll find rows of pews, towering chandeliers, and a shining mahogany bemah. As you walk around, your feet sink softly into the floor of sand. Spanish and Portuguese Jews from the Netherlands and Brazil were early settlers in the Caribbean islands, taking on influential roles in the local communities, and the Jewish community in Curaçao was notable among those in the New World. (Nearby the Hendrickplein Jewish Temple built in 1865 is also well worth a visit.) The reasons for the Jewish migration to the islands and the reason for the sand floor may be connected–an attempt to avoid persecution. As Jews made their new home in the Caribbean, fears of persecution lingered. The sand floor is said to have been there to muffle the sound of steps as a reminder of the secret Jewish services performed in the recent past. While that is one interpretation, the true origin of the sand-floored synagogue is largely mysterious. Nonetheless, the tradition has carried on in other far flung Jewish communities. Sand floor synagogues can be found in four other locations, in Jamaica, in Surinam, in Saint Thomas, and in the Portuguese Synagogue of Amsterdam. The building is in very good condition, and guests can attend the regular services. You can also check out their Jewish Cultural Historical Museum, which contains information on the island’s Jewish community and history as well as artifacts such as old scrolls and spice boxes. The city of Willemstad, a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site, looks at first glance like an Amsterdam lookalike, though it has a population of only around 150,000. Curaçao, an island in the Caribbean just off the coast of South America, only gained autonomy from the Netherlands on October 10, 2010, which was the first time since the arrival of the Spanish in 1499 that the islanders regained political control."
61,Cathedral of Thorns,"Willemstad, Curaçao",This living labyrinth made entirely of thorns is filled with art.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cathedral-of-thorns,"As you wander through this maze, look but don’t touch—everything is made from thorns. This prickly labyrinth is a work of visual art, with indentations in the walls to display different sculptures from modern artists. The Cathedral of Thorns is a work in progress. It was first conceived in 2014 by  the award-winning Dutch artist Herman Van Bergen, who continues to tweak this building-sized piece of art. The living labyrinth is made from sumpiñas, the thorns of Acacia tortuosa, a desert plant that is plentiful in Curaçao. Creating this building-sized piece of art became a community effort. Van Bergen enlisted local youth to help, some working on the construction and others collecting plant material. Visitors are invited to walk through the maze, experiencing what the artist describes as “a journey through a troublesome history toward a bright future.” Each of these extremes are represented by the “hostile yet beautiful thorns.” While experiencing the cathedral, you may even meet the artist himself as he fine-tunes his creation."
62,Williwood Sign,"Sint Willibrordus, Curaçao","This tiny tropical village was sick of anonymity so the locals made this sign, which actually changed the name of the town.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/williwood-sign,"Sint Willibrordus was once just a nice, if little known, village 12 miles northwest of Willemstad, the capitol of Curaçao, but the locals, tired of being overlooked, have now rebranded their small town as “Williwood” by building a cheeky, hillside monument. Previously, the remote town was best known for its grand church that dates back to the 1880’s, but in recent years the town’s independently constructed “Williwood” sign has taken the spotlight as the can’t miss attraction. Taking the nickname for the area and writing it large in a parody of California’s iconic Hollywood sign, enterprising citizens built a new identity for their town. The sign itself rests on a modest hill at the back of a barren soccer field and is prone to blowing over during storms, but the monument is so beloved by locals that people will run out before the gales are even over and fix any fallen letters, claiming bragging rights if they get there first. While the Williwood sign began as somewhat of a joke, its appeal took almost immediate hold and the town of Sint Willibrordus was officially renamed Williwood in 2011. Now visitors, of which there are markedly more, can buy hats, t-shirts, and other pieces of tat bearing the Williwood name with nary a celebrity to block traffic in sight."
63,The Wreck of Air Aruba P4-YSA,"Willemstad, Curaçao","Like something out of a pulp adventure, this abandoned plane wreck is slowly being retaken by the Caribbean jungle.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-wreck-of-air-aruba-p4-ysa-willemstad-curacao,"Top of every intrepid explorer’s list must be to find a ruined airplane hidden away in a tropical locale. Bringing to mind the television show Lost or the 1986 film Romancing the Stone, there is just something haunting about coming across the wreckage of a plane slowly being reclaimed by nature. Just such a plane lies in waiting on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao. About half an hour drive south of the capital of Willemstad, just north of Kontiki Beach and nestled at the foot of the southern mountains surrounding the salt pans of Jan Thiel, lies the remnants of Air Aruba flight P4-YSA. Climbing inside, one finds that all the seats are gone, but the doors and remnants of the airline can still be seen. Overhead panels indicate the old reading lights and stewardess call buttons. Strewn on the floor amongst the derelict emergency oxygen masks are the signs indicating seat row numbers followed by aisle or window. Walking through the wrecked fuselage it looks like a plane that crashed into the tropical jungle decades ago and where all signs of the passengers have simply disappeared. As you walk forward carefully on the bared struts of the fuselage towards the pilot’s cabin, now home to wasps and pink jungle flowers, you can see that most of the machinery is still there. Altimeters, air pressure dials, countless electrical switches and fuel pump gauges, just as the pilot left them. The front glass has smashed inwards allowing vines and palm fronds to grow inside over the wrecked cockpit. The airplane was a turboprop airliner originally designed by the Nihon Aircraft Manufacturing Company of Japan. Built between 1962 and 1974, the NAMC YS-11s were capable of carrying 60 passengers and looked similar to the multipurpose American Douglas DC-3s. The one slowly disintegrating on a small island in the south Caribbean sea was bought and run by the commercial airline Air Aruba. Beginning as a short haul company in 1986, Air Aruba principally ran between the ABC islands of the Lesser Antilles: Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao. Rising costs led to the company declaring bankruptcy in 2000, by which time the airline was chartering flights to further destinations such as Domino, St.Maarten, and Miami. The first two planes in its fleet, bought in 1986, were the Japanese twin props, registration numbers P4-YSA and YSB. Both of the planes have suffered differing fates. One, YSB, currently lies in 40 feet of water in the reefs surrounding Aruba. Damaged beyond repair during Hurricane Lenny in 1999, it was intentionally sunk where it now enjoys a new lease of life as a popular scuba diving wreck. Its twin plane, YSA, ended up in Curaçao. At one point, the broken and wrecked plane, shorn of its wings and twin props, had been planned to be used as a restaurant. An adjoining brick and adobe structure on the starboard side of the plane was to house the kitchens, whilst diners enjoyed the unusual setting for their evening meal. But the restaurant never came to fruition. No records show who owned this forgotten plane, or how it came to be here. It seems more likely that it was moved rather than crashed, as no newspaper records tell anything about it. The NAMC YS-11s in general have quite a doomed history. Of the 182 originally built by the NAMC in Japan, there have been over 20 hull loss accidents leading to over 260 deaths. One of the planes, run by Korean Air, was hijacked in 1969 over North Korean airspace; the plane, its crew and passengers are still held in North Korean territory. In 1976 one of the planes, owned by Olympic Airways, crashed into the side of a mountain in Kozani, Greece. The history of the planes is one of forced landings, overshooting runways, and being ditched at sea. For now, the former Air Aruba plane falls gradually into ruin as the tropical forest slowly grows around it."
64,Boiling Lake,"Delices, Dominica","This mountaintop lake bubbles and steams in a perpetual boil, thanks to its direct link to the Earth's interior.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boiling-lake,"There’s nothing quite like a secluded lake. Passing through a thicket of trees or over a rugged trail, and suddenly catching a glimpse of that clear blue water, its surface sparkling like glass in the hot sun, and sipping the cool, refreshing water from the mountain springs that feed it. Or, on a particularly hot summer day, jumping headlong into it for a jolt of cold refreshment from head to toe. A mountain lake like that is universal in its appeal, and Dominica is no different. Except in one spot. In one particularly odd basin, pooled high atop Watt Mountain in Morne Trois Pitons National Park, the water simply isn’t that refreshing. In fact, it’s boiling hot. And while “boiling hot” is a common phrase used for hyperbole, visitors should not test the veracity of this claim – drinking or bathing in this water will result in death, or at least severe burns. Not that most visitors would be tempted to do such a thing. A thick cloud of balmy steam emanates from and surrounds the menacing lake, leaving no question as to how hot the water really is. But if that alone isn’t convincing enough, the swirling, bubbling maelstrom of churning water at the lake’s center confirms without a doubt that the water has been brought to a boil. Enchanted by evil magic as this body of water may seem, the phenomenon is actually quite simple, though rare. The bowl of rocky clay that forms this lake is not your average scoop in the ground – instead, this lake has a direct line to the molten subsurface of the Earth, with vents pumping scalding steam and gasses into the water, heating it to an instant boil. But magic or no magic, this perpetually boiling-then-evaporating body of water does seem to defy the laws of physics – or at least the laws of logic – and creates a strange and bemusing site at the top of this misty mountain."
65,The Rock at Pagua,"Atkinson, Dominica",A flower grows on this giant stone that is said be able to control minds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-rock-at-pagua-atkinson-dominica,"The Rock at Pagua is the setting of one of the most interesting legends of the Kalinago people involving mind control, flowers, and a rock-dwelling spirit. According to the folklore of the indigenous Kalinago people of Dominica, the nearly 60-foot rock is home to a powerful spirit. Locals say a small white flower grows near the rock, however it blooms only one day a year. Anyone lucky enough to find this flower, should rub the bloom in the palm of their hand. Upon doing so, the legend says that if they point their palm towards someone they wish to have control over, while calling their name, they will have control over that person. However, it’s not all flowers and mind control. There are a number of large cracks on the surface of the rock, and it’s said that if you see the spirit of the rock living inside the rock, a loved one is sure to die soon afterwards. Although much of the story is local legend, there are some interesting observable truths. For example, there really is a white flower that blooms infrequently near the rock. If one does find the plant while it’s in bloom, a strong hallucinogenic and psychedelic tea is said to be able to be made from the leaves. At other times of the year when the flower is not in bloom, the leaves do not have the same effect."
66,Wavine Cyrique (Secret Beach),"Rosalie, Dominica",The hike to this stunning waterfall on a black sand beach is not for the faint of heart.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wavine-cyrique-secret-beach,"This unique natural feature is one of many things that have given the Nature Isle a reputation as an outdoor adventurer’s playground—but getting to it is not for the faint of heart. It is one of the very few waterfalls that descends not into a lake or river, but directly onto a beach/into the sea (depending on the tide level at that time). At low tide, the water drops onto a large stretch of black sand beach, which you will almost definitely have to yourself. At high tide (not recommended as a time to visit), the falls drop straight into the Atlantic Ocean. It is especially magical on a sunny day when the waterfall causes rainbows. Even many locals have never visited, but those who have (mainly those who live on the east coast, or adventurous types) call it “Wavine Cyrique” or “Secret Beach.” The only way to reach this beach is by a series of rope ladders and tree roots that hang from the cliff face. After Hurricane Maria in 2017 destroyed the complex web of roots and ropes that used to serve as a ladder, locals have installed a sturdy new ladder with wooden rungs and strong ropes. Dominica’s tourist board advises that you only visit with a registered guide. Once you reach the beach, the waterfall’s icy cold water is perfect for a shower after the sweaty climb. It is a strange contrast to the warm ocean water washing over your feet. Wavine Cyrique is an idyllic place to sunbathe and play in the waterfall; but not for swimming in the ocean, due to large waves and a strong current.  Discover Dominica advise that you must visit with a registered guide, not alone. You can find a guide by visiting the Tourist Office in Roseau; or on days when a cruise ship is in port, many guides wait onshore. A lot of taxi drivers are also registered guides, so you can ask around amongst drivers. Registered guides wear ID tags or have them in the front of their mini-busses. Your guide will drive you to the spot, which is just south of Rosalie. The climb is not suitable for those with a fear of heights or vertigo. It requires a high level of fitness and moderate agility. The rope ladder rungs are quite far apart so it is more challenging for shorter adults and not suitable for children."
67,Jacko Steps,Dominica,"This historic hiding place, often used by people escaping slavery, is a testament to a heroic struggle for freedom.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jacko-steps,"Like many islands in the Caribbean, Dominica has a dark history concerning slavery but also bears testimony to the valiant fight of oppressed people for liberty. Jacko Steps marks the location of a camp formed by the eponymous Jacko, who in the mid-18th century escaped from Beaubois Estate after he was taken from his home in Africa by European enslavers. After settling a plateau in Dominica’s inland jungle, the place soon became a refuge for other people escaping slavery—who were known as “maroons”—as well as a center for organized resistance against oppression. For decades, Jacko and his fellow maroons fought successfully against the colonial troops, employing guerilla-style tactics and often taking their enemies by surprise. They continued on until their camp was discovered during an offensive by then-governor George Robert Ainslie in 1814, which led to the death of Jacko and many of his followers and the destruction of the camp. Today the place is a poignant reminder of the bloody colonial history, as well as the maroons’ fight against the brutal practice of slavery. From the 17th to 19th centuries, some five million enslaved men and women were taken from Africa to the Caribbean. Only one historical marker of the camp remains: A series of massive steps, cut into the rock by Jacko and his people leads down to the river and provided an alternate route to access—or escape—the camp. Apart from these steps, barely any physical evidence of the settlement remains. And still, as soon as one stands in the middle of the plateau surrounded by the thick, verdant jungle, the history of the place seems to invade one’s pores. With a little imagination, you begin to see the camp and its inhabitants around you.  Getting to Jacko’s Steps involves a hike through the jungle starting close to the roundabout in Pont Cassé on the road leading to Marigot. After reaching the plateau, you can either turn around to go back the way you came or, if you’re adventurous and fit, continue down the slippery steps to the Layou River, through which you can hike back to the road. If you choose the latter option, be careful, as it involves hiking through sometimes knee-deep water and the current can be strong."
68,Bubble Beach Spa,"Soufriere, Dominica",Thermal springs underneath the seabed provide the heat and bubbles for these beachside natural hot tubs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bubble-beach-spa,"Dominica is a hotbed of the weird and wonderful things that nature has to offer. One of the most striking examples is this mineral-rich sea that fizzes like a vat of champagne due to volcanic gasses bubbling up from thermal springs on the seabed. While most tourists will experience this spectacular phenomenon—not to mention the plethora of colourful coral and sea life that it nourishes—by snorkelling or diving off at Champagne Reef, locals tend to head a little farther south, to Bubble Beach in the village of Soufriere. Run by Dale Mitchell, a Soufriere local who often goes by “Mr. Bubble,” the waters here offer the same fizzing wonder as Champagne Reef, but with added bonuses. Mitchell fashioned natural baths in the shallow parts of the sea, using rocks and sandbags to mark out the best areas to sit and maintain some of the potent heat of the springs. Depending on the tide, different spots in these baths range from pleasantly warm to almost unbearably hot. At most times of day, you can find local people of all ages (plus some fish and small crabs) in these baths, relaxing and enjoying the many supposed health benefits of the waters. They’ve been credited with everything from easing joint pain to preventing the itch of mosquito bites. Swim out in the deeper water to cool off and see various fish, corals and bubbles. Full-face masks, snorkels and flippers are available to rent on the beach. The excellently-maintained sandy beach features a bar with homemade rum punches, local beer and soft drinks served by Dale himself. Try his bush rum for a taste of the amazing Dominican-grown spices. It is a fantastic place to sit and enjoy the view of Scott’s Head, the tombolo at the southwest tip of the island where the Caribbean Sea meets the Atlantic Ocean. There is also a shaded area, changing rooms, sun-loungers for rent, a photo bench, and a massage bungalow. It is directly in front of St. Mark’s, one of the oldest and prettiest churches on the island decorated in red, blue, and yellow. Bubble Beach is an important hub for village life and is especially popular around sunset, when there is often food available. On Sundays, Mitchell often cooks up a big lunch for the many Soufriere residents who come together after church. Arrive before 2 p.m. if you want some food! Bubble Beach Spa is publicly accessible and free to use. However, it is recommended to put some money in the donation box, and spend generously at the bar if you can. This is a local man’s business that had to be rebuilt from total destruction after Hurricane Maria in 2017.  Take the local bus from Roseau to Soufriere. Ask to be dropped off near Bubble Beach or if the driver does not know it, ask for the village church. Follow the first turning right (towards the sea and the visible tower of the church) when you enter the village, and there is a sign for Bubble Beach at the end of the road, instructing you to turn right again. Bubble Beach is open at all times of day; if nobody is there and you want something, call Mr Bubble's number which is written on the bar. Remember to bring some cash for the donation box (as well as the bar and equipment rental)."

Beginning life as prehistoric sinkholes the lakes were once underground caves that collapsed in on themselves and filled with water. The lakes are continually fed by an underground river that keeps the waters fresh and full. The constant flow into and out of the lakes brings a diversity of minerals, bacteria, and animal life into the site. This constant shifting causes the waters of the lakes to turn vibrant shades of greens and blues. In addition to the arresting colors the lakes are host to an abundance of turtles, bats, and fish. Surrounding each of the lakes is dense tropical foliage giving them the air of hidden jungle oases. The Three Eyes also welcome a vibrant and diverse population of another species: the tourist. The site has become a popular destination for travelers looking to experience a little bit of the natural magic that the Dominican Republic has to offer. The admission ticket costs 100 RD. If you want to see the fourth lake you need to pay an additional 25 RD at the boatsman at the fourth lake."

Two years later, it was turned into the Meson de la Cava restaurant. The restaurant, considered one of the most distinguished in the area by both residents of and tourists to the Dominican Republic, is tucked into a natural limestone cave created by waves over billions of years. In addition to provisions from the OAS, the restaurant displays several of the valuable belongings found in the cave from previous occupants, which include the Taino Indians, buccaneers who hid in the caves before launching an attack on Santo Domingo, and the guerrillas who fought against the occupation by foreign forces in 1930. The restaurant has three entrances at street level, but visitors must descend a 40-foot spiral staircase to get to the lobby, which is filled with stalactites and stalagmites. While some might expect that the restaurant relies on its unique environs to draw visitors in, the Meson de la Cava is known for preparing some of the region’s best cuisine. Local, hand-selected ingredients are brought in daily, as is a catch from the Caribbean Sea. The diverse menu is focused around Spanish-influenced modern classical French and local Caribbean cuisine."
71,Cueva de las Maravillas (Cave of Wonders),"La Caña, Dominican Republic",Hundreds of pieces of ancient Taíno art cover the walls of this Caribbean cave system.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cueva-de-las-maravillas-cave-of-wonders,"The 800 meters of Cueva de las Maravillas National Park are decorated with hundreds of Taíno cave paintings. The Taíno people are the Indigenous residents of Greater Antilles. It was the Taíno who greeted Christopher Columbus’s arrival in Hispanola (now the Dominican Republic) in 1492. Throughout the Spanish colonial period that followed, their culture was ruthlessly suppressed, and through both violence and disease their numbers greatly depleted. In 1561, colonist and early humanitarian Bartolomé de las Casas wrote: “There were 60,000 people living on this island [when I arrived in 1508], including the Indians; so that from 1494 to 1508, over three million people had perished from war, slavery and the mines. Who in future generations will believe this?” The caves are significant in Taíno mythology. Distinctive art made by the early Taíno are etched on rocks around the island and on stalagmites in caves across the island. Inside the cave you’ll find approximately 10 petroglyphs (engravings in the rock), and 472 pictographs (paintings on the walls). The art depicts a diverse range of subjects that includes humans, plants, animals, and abstract designs. In one room, known as the Water Mirror Gallery, the roof of the cave and the Great Panel can be seen in the reflection of an artificial lake. The Great Panel features a cave painting that depicts a Taíno funeral ritual. Cueva de las Maravillas was declared a national park in 1997, and the caves have been open to the public since 2003. Although the cave has come under criticism for the way in which paths and lighting were installed, possibly damaging some of the geologic features, it was awarded the 2003 Gold prize in the International Landscape Architecture Bienal Award.  Today, visitors can explore about 200 meters on footpaths that wind through the galleries. Visits to the cave are strictly controlled, in small groups with a guide. Tours take about an hour."
72,Castillo Mundo King,"Sosúa, Dominican Republic",An eccentric German artist built this weird and wondrous castle packed with shocking sculptures and alien art.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castillo-mundo-king,"Probably one of the most bizarre places on the planet, this five-story castle on the top of a hill in Sosua is home to hundreds of unusual artworks, including alien-themed art, extraterrestrial messages, and at least four spaceships, as well as a sizable collection of exotic Haitian sculptures. Rolf Schulz, a German artist, decided at the age of 51 that he would leave his hometown, Hamburg, to pursue his dream of building a castle in the Dominican Republic. And so the Castillo Mundo King was born. The artist began this labor of love in 1990 and lived in the dwelling with no electricity or running water until he died, in January 2018. Before his death he would regale visitors with stories of UFOs and extraterrestrial life. His self-built palace now functions as an otherworldly art museum. The castle’s five floors are filled with several hundred pieces of surreal art, including an impressive collection of sculptures made by Haitian and Dominican artists (many of them exotic), as well as carvings in stone and wood, paintings, and murals. Those that climb the stairs all the way up to the top floor are met with a reward: The view looking out over the Bay of Puerto Plata is breathtaking.  Open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The entry fee is 300 DOP ($6 USD). For a small tip a local guide will show you around the museum."
73,Museo Del Ambar (Amber Museum),"Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic","Collection of fossils, plants, and ancient animals encased in amber.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-del-ambar-museum-of-amber,"The Dominican Republic has a special relationship with amber, producing and extraordinary range of colors. Christopher Columbus wrote about the local Taino Indians amber-adorned shoes, which he exchanged for a necklace made of Baltic amber. Considered a semi-precious gem, amber is formed when tree sap fossilizes, sometimes catching plants, and animals in it. Amber mining has, over the centuries, been big business in the Dominican Republic. The German Bentz brothers made their fortune at the turn of the last century in another popular export: sugar. They built the opulent Villa Bentz in 1919 at the peak of their success. In later years hard times would force them to sell the mansion, after which it began to fall into disrepair. It was not until Didi and Aldo Costa restored it for their museum that it reclaimed its former beauty. In 1970, the Costa family moved to Puerto Plata and began the collection of amber that would eventually fill the museum. Curated with the assistance of the American Brandt Ghepart of the Museum of Natural History in Cleveland, the museum opened in March 1982. On display are many rare finds, including the most famous display: a nearly 17-inch long ancient lizard trapped in amber. About 100 meters from the Church of San Felipe on Calle Duarte"
74,Faro a Colon (Columbus Lighthouse),"Santo Domingo Este, Dominican Republic",The final resting place of Christopher Columbus - or possibly someone else.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/faro-a-colon-columbus-lighthouse,"In 1506, at the age of 55, the explorer Christopher Columbus died in Spain. But death was not the end of his adventures - his body continued to travel in a centuries-long shell game. Keep your eyes on the body: Immediately after his death, Columbus was buried Valladolid, the town in which he spent his last days. Then, on the wishes of his son Diego, the body was moved to Seville. Meanwhile, Diego headed back to the Dominican Republic to begin construction of a cathedral to hold his father’s remains, in accordance with his final wishes. Unfortunately, Diego died in 1526 before he could make that happen, and he was, in turn, interred in Seville next to his father. Both Columbuses stayed there for another 16 years, but when the Cathedral of Santa Maria was completed in the Dominican Republic, Diego’s widow put the wheels in motion to have both bodies moved there. In 1542 the remains sailed the ocean blue again, and joined the body of Christopher’s brother, Bartholomew, who had died in Santo Domingo the year before. There they remained for more than 200 years, but when the Spanish were ousted from the Dominican Republic in 1795, they took the explorer’s body with them to the other Spanish stronghold in the Caribbean: Havana, Cuba. Back in the Dominican Republic, nearly a century late a construction worker working on the cathedral renovation uncovered a lead box - unimpressive, save for the inscription on the inside of the lid: “The illustrious and excellent man, Don Colon, Admiral of the Ocean Sea.” At first pass, it seemed obvious that the Spanish must have, in their haste, taken the wrong box. But there’s a catch - both father, Christopher, and son, Diego, were known as “Don Colon” in their lifetimes, and both held the same title “Admiral of the Ocean Sea”. By 1898, when the Spanish were pushed out of Cuba by the Americans, both the Spaniards and Dominicans had decided firmly that the remains in their own possession were the authentic item, and that the other must be holding onto the son. Therefore, in Seville an elaborate cathedral tomb was prepared for the explorer’s return to his homeland, while in his adopted home another “official” tomb was planned. It took the Dominicans somewhat longer to get their design act together. It was not until 1931 that a design competition was held, won by a Scottish architect who proposed the 688 foot long cruciform memorial complex that now stands. The building was barely ready by the 1992 500th anniversary of Columbus’ arrival, when the remains were finally interred. In 2003, the controversy was tackled by DNA science, and the remains in Seville tested against known remains of Columbus’ brother Diego and son Fernando. Although promising, the results are not conclusive, and thus far, the remains interred at the lighthouse in Santo Domingo Este have not been tested, so for now, the mystery endures."
75,Ruins of San Nicolás de Bari Hospital,"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic",The first hospital in the New World.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruins-hospital-st-nicolas-of-bari,"A place of mercy built under a reign of terror, what many consider to be the first hospital of the Americas was constructed in 1503-1508 by order of Nicolas de Ovando, Spanish soldier, knight, and Governor of the Indies. Only a few years had passed since Columbus was removed from governorship of the island in chains, accused of gross abuses of power. Columbus was replaced by Francisco de Bobadilla, who was replaced just a few years later by Ovando. Ovando arrived in Hispanola (now the Dominican Republic) from Spain with 2,500 colonists, including a young Francisco Pizarro, not yet a conquistador. The colony also included the Dominican priest Bartolomé de las Casas who would go on to write about the plight of the natives and African slaves to be amongst the first human rights activists of the new world. Although this first hospital was founded under his rule, Ovando was no gentle ruler. He is remembered for his ruthless and violent suppression of native uprisings, and for forcing those who survived into a kind of indentured servitude. After his eventual return to Spain, he was replaced by Columbus’ son Diego, whose home, the Alcazar de Colon, still stands nearby in Santo Domingo. The hospital is named for the famous Saint Nicholas of Bari, Italy whose tomb emits a holy ooze that has been regarded as a cure-all for centuries. Over its 350 years of operation it has been attacked by pirates, acted as a military hospital, and witnessed revolution. It finally succumbed to a combination of old age and earthquake damage, with much of the structure torn down in 1911 to reduce the risk of collapse. It now sits abandoned and in ruins, home to flocks of pigeons."
76,Altos de Chavon,"La Romana, Dominican Republic",This replica medieval European village in the Dominican Republic was built by a Hollywood set designer.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/altos-de-chavon,"Sitting in stark contrast to the traditional Dominican architecture, the purpose-built village of Altos de Chavon in La Romana was designed by a Hollywood set designer to look like a medieval village from halfway across the world using the stones of a blasted mountain. The village was founded in 1976 after an executive from Paramount Pictures learned of a road in the area that had to be forged through a portion of a mountain. His idea was to use the leftover stones from the demolition of the mountain to recreate an entire village that would celebrate the artisans of the Dominican Republic. It took six years to be completed but thanks to the efforts of a small army of regional artisans, the village was handcrafted using era-appropriate techniques including woodworking and stone-cutting, to make it as authentic as possible. The jewels of the village include a scenic historic church and a wide stone amphitheater that can seat around 5,000 visitors. There is also an art school located in the hilltop village devoted to making sure a new era of artists and artisans will continue to come out of the area. Despite being a completely fabricated village, the authentic artistry on display in the verdant settlement makes stepping into Altos de Chavron like stepping back into medieval times. Or at least watching a movie about them. On the town of La Romana. Next to Casa de Campo complex. $25 a head to get in."

One can see the pictures of the original building before reconstruction inside. Within the museum are numerous exhibits showing the history of rum and sugar cane, both its basis in slavery and eventually its transformation to a source of revenue for the island. There are stoves of bronze, a still and numerous other items from the history of rum making in the Dominican Republic, as well as plows and other items for harvesting the sugar cane to make it. Sugar cane can be found growing inside of the open patio. Also included are pictures of the “Roneros” (the men who made the rum) and some old casks filled with glorious Dominican rum. The front of the museum also has all the Dominican rums for sale at reasonable prices. If seeing all this rum has made you thirsty, there is a nice bar inside where you can enjoy a rum drink, with all the satisfaction of knowing the history found in your glass."
78,La Isabela,"La Isabela, Dominican Republic",Columbus' failed colony in the New World.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-isabela,"Named for the Spanish queen who funded his expeditions to the New World, this was among the first European settlements - Viking contact pre-dates it - in the Americas. La Isabela was established on the northern coast of Hispanola in 1494 by Christopher Columbus and 1500 colonists. By 1498, it was abandoned. Archaeological investigations led by a team from the Florida Museum of Natural History between 1989 -1999, revealed most of what we know about this early town. Returning on his second voyage, Columbus arrived at the site of La Isabela with 17 ships loaded with settlers, livestock, and materials for building and trade with the local Taino Indians. A sturdy town wall and stone buildings were complimented by 200 palm thatch huts, not unlike those of the natives, for living quarters. It was not technically the first buildings by Columbus - in 1492 on his first voyage, he built a small fort at Concepción de la Vega which was surrounded by a small settlement. Years later, when gold was discovered there Concepción became America’s first gold boomtown. But La Isabela was intended to be a city, not a fortress. But much like Jamestown and Roanoke to come, settling in the Americas proved much harder than imagined. The rough weather, crop failures, and hurricanes on the coast drove the settlers away from La Isabela in just four years, moving instead to Santo Domingo. Visitors to the site can find more information at the Museum of la Isabela."
79,Dr. Rafael M. Moscoso National Botanical Garden,"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic",A remarkable range of flora and fauna are represented in this Dominican nature preserve.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dr-rafael-m-moscoso-national-botanical-garden,"Named after the accomplished Dominican botanist who cataloged the considerable range of plant life of Hispaniola, the Dr. Rafael M. Moscoso National Botanical Garden was founded in 1976. Covering 400 acres (160 hectares), the park showcases the remarkable endemism in both the birds and vegetation native to the second-largest island in the Caribbean. The garden features collections of bromeliads, ferns, palms, succulents, medicinal plants, and an exhibit of over 300 types of orchids. The expansive, well-maintained park is also a popular destination for bird watchers, as a wide variety of avian species—both familiar and rare—make either permanent or transitory homes in the Dominican Republic. Species such as the Hispaniolan woodpecker, Hispaniolan parakeet, Limpkin, Broad-billed tody, and the West Indian Whistling-duck can be seen here among the lush and verdant vegetation. A traditional Japanese garden can also be found on the premises. The park’s symbol, found throughout in various representations, is the leaf of a guanito, which is a palm tree common to the garden."
80,El Carnaval de la Vega,"La Vega, Dominican Republic",Largest pre-Lent festival in the Dominican Republic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-carnaval-de-la-vega,"The Dominican Republican’s African heritage is reflected in the wildly colorful masks and costumes that are brought out and into the streets for the annual El Carnaval de la Vega celebrating the pre-Lent season, one of the oldest and most popular Dominican traditions. The El Carnaval de la Vega dates back to the time when the first European settlers arrived in the 1500s. Beginning as a religious activity to celebrate the time just before Lent, El Carnaval de la Vega’s theme revolved around the victory of good over evil. In recent years this festival has evolved to include the celebration of Dominican independence, which falls on February 27 every year. During the entire month of February, carnivals are celebrated on weekends and have spread to include most provinces, but El Carnaval de la Vega remains the biggest of them all. For El Carnaval de la Vega, all the stops are pulled: Music, costumes, food, drinks, and more all add up to a colorful and vibrant celebration of the island’s traditions and folklore. Some of the activities that take place during the festival include a choosing of Miss Carnaval Vegano in a pageant; the crowning of the king of the festival; an opening parade; a concert every Sunday with popular singers; and a closing parade. La Vega, where the festival is held, is the largest city and municipality of the central Dominican Republic and the third largest of the whole country. The area was settled by Europeans when Christopher Columbus built a small fort near what is today the city in 1494. Intended to guard the route that interior gold deposits were carried along on their way out of the country, the fort was managed by keepers who eventually allowed a Spanish settlement to grow around it. In 1562, the town was destroyed and completely buried by an earthquake."
81,Memorial Museum of Dominican Resistance,"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic",A collection cataloguing one of the most brutal dictatorships in modern history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/memorial-museum-of-dominican-resistance,"An unflinching manifestation of the darkest corners of national memory, the Memorial Museum of Dominican Resistance honors the men and women who fought the dictatorial regime of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and continued to push for change during the chaotic years of political transition under Trujillo’s successor Joaquin Balaguer. Almost cartoonish in his self-aggrandizing, sadistic villainy, Trujillo, known as “El Chivo,” spent 31 years ruling with an iron fist, seizing whatever property he liked, building lavish homes, funnelling the country’s wealth to family and friends, violating young women at will, and commissioning massive monuments to his own greatness. Along the way, he systematically eliminated any opposition to his regime, filling the cemeteries of the Dominican Republic with more than 50,000 of his own people. He controlled the Dominican Republic from 1930 up to his assassination in 1961, and although he was far from the only dictator in Latin America at the time, his ruthless command put his contemporaries to shame. Both a reckoning and a condemnation, the Memorial Museum of Dominican Resistance in Santo Domingo features replications of infamous torture centers, dioramas of particular historical episodes, rotating exhibitions, and a record where families can register Trujillo Era victims of violence and crime. Opened to the public in 2011, the project is a reminder to future generations that the past must not be forgotten, lest the present be taken for granted."
82,Fortaleza Ozama (Ozama Fortress),"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic",The oldest colonial fortress in the Americas was once the home and later prison of Christopher Columbus.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fortaleza-ozama,"Fortaleza Ozama is an imposing fortress located in the old city within Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. Built as a defense against native rebellions as well as foreign invasions, the fortress has been resilient to time, having outlasted numerous nations and governments who have used it as a symbol of their ultimate authority. Built in 1502, Fortaleza Ozama, named after nearby Ozama River, is considered to be the oldest fortress of European design in the New World. Spanish colonizers used Taino and African enslaved people to build the fortress using local coral stone. The walls are almost 10 feet (three meters) thick, making the fortress nearly impervious. In addition to being a military base, the fortress was home to the viceroys of Santo Domingo. The most well-known of these viceroys was Christopher Columbus who, along with his family, lived in Fortaleza Ozama during his tenuous reign. So corrupt and tyrannical was Columbus that even the imperial Spanish government judged him unfit to govern and had him jailed in the very fortress he called home. After he was dismissed, Columbus never returned to the building. The tumultuous history of the island would see the fortress exchanged between various countries including England, France, Haiti, the former Gran Colombia, and the United States. It proved to be so well-constructed that it was still used as a prison well into the 20th century. During the draconian rule of dictator Rafael Trujillo, Fortaleza Ozama was where countless political prisoners were detained and tortured. After much-needed national reforms, Fortaleza Ozama closed as a prison in the late ’60s. No longer a symbol of oppression and war, it is now a national landmark where visitors can enjoy the splendor of the island. Visitors can climb la Torre del Homenaje (Tower of Homage), once used to look out for pirate ships, and enjoy a beautiful 360-degree-view of Santo Domingo.  Visitors can enter Fortaleza Ozama from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday. On Sundays, Fortaleza Ozama closes at 4 p.m."
83,Cathedral of St. Mary of the Incarnation,"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic","Built in 1512, the oldest cathedral in the Americas.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cathedral-of-st-mary-of-the-incarnation,"The oldest cathedral in the Americas, the construction of the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Incarnation began in 1512 and wasn’t completed until 1541, 29 years later. On February 12, 1546, Pope Paul III granted the status of Metropolitan Cathedral and Primate of the Indies on the site. It has since been the only Archdiocese to have held this title. The Cathedral of St. Mary of the Incarnation in Santo Domingo, dedicated to St. Mary of the Incarnation, contains a vast treasury of art constituted in paintings (including a panel of the Virgin of Altagracia dating back to 1523), old woodwork, furniture, monuments, and tombstones, among other things. The treasures that stand out the most are the mausoleums of the archbishops of the colonial period. For a time, this cathedral housed the remains of Christopher Columbus. Located between Calle Arzobispo Merino and Isabel la Católica, next to Columbus Park in the city of Santo Domingo de Guzman, the cathedral is fronted by a golden-tinted coral limestone facade. The church combines elements of both Gothic and Baroque with some lavish styles as exemplified by the high altar chiseled out of silver. The first noticeable feature of the structure are the solid limestone walls and three doors, two of which are Gothic and the third main door which is plateresque. There are twelve side chapels, three aisles, and a nave within. The roof of the nave is pitched, while the aisles have cross vaulted ceilings. The length of the basilica is 177 feet, the width of each of the three aisles is 75 feet, the height to the vaulted ceilings is 52 feet, and the total area is 32,000 square feet."
84,The Sundial of Santo Domingo,"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic","The first official clock in North America, it kept time for the Spanish government of Santo Domingo.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sundial-of-santo-domingo,"Before there were cell phones, watches, clocks, and about a million other ways to check the time, there was the sundial. The El Reloj de Sol de Santo Domingo is one of the oldest sundials in North America, and among the first known “official” time telling devices in North America. Located in Santo Domingo and built in 1753, it was used to keep official time for the Spanish under the administration of Francisco Rubio. Built on a square pillar of rock, the sun dial - which works by casting the shadow from the moving sun onto a sort of time map - has two vertical dials and a equatorial dial on top, a replacement for the original which was broken off in a hurricane. Having no moving parts, and being made of only metal, mortar and rock the sundial is in excellent condition and continues to tell the time perfectly."
