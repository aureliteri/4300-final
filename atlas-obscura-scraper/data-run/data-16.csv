0,Blue Lagoon,"Grindavík, Iceland",Medicinal spa created with the discharge from a geothermal energy plant.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blue-lagoon,"The lava fields by the Svartsengi geothermal plant were accidentally transformed into a spa in the 1970s. Discharged water from the plant, which is rich in salt, blue-green algae, sulphur, and white silica, was found to help with skin problems by locals who ventured into the run-off. All of Iceland’s electricity comes from hydroelectric or geothermal sources, like that at the Blue Lagoon. By utilizing the water left by the many glaciers and the heat coming from below the volcanic island, the country requires fossil fuels only for its transportation. The Icelandic power plants are not generating energy so much as harnessing the renewable sources that are constantly coming up from the ground. The Blue Lagoon is now one of Iceland’s most popular attractions, while the geothermal plant continues to work at its edge, pulling seawater up from 2,000 meters underground, bringing earth minerals with it. Once moved through the turbines in the plant, the seawater comes into the lagoon via a pipeline, free of bacteria and with a temperature of around 39°C (102°F). Hundreds of thousands of visitors come each year to swim in the sapphire waters, shrouded with an ethereal steam mist."
1,Svartifoss,Iceland,The unique waterfall in Iceland's south features a backdrop of geometric black lava columns.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/svartifoss,"On paper, the Svartifoss Waterfall is nothing to write home about. It doesn’t enter the top 10 lists for size or volume, and it’s quietly tucked in a small national park in southern Iceland. But a picture is worth 1,000 words, and the black, hexagonal columns that frame the thin falls make it one of the most striking and unique waterfalls in the world. Formed from lava flows in Skaftafell National Park, the Svartifoss are situated along a beautifully marked track a few kilometers into the park. Over centuries, lava flows cooled at a languid pace in Iceland’s frosty air, gently forming the stacked hexagonal crystals that provide the backdrop for the falls. Turned to a striking black color over its creation, the cliffs contrast with the green flora and cascading falls and provide the site with its name. Although the falls are so beautiful you might be tempted to step in for a dip, it is far from recommended as the bottom of the falls are covered with sharp rocks. Instead, visitors should hike through the park to the falls, which were recently featured in the Bon Iver film clip, Holocene.  There is a marked track from Skaftafell National Park to lead you to Svartifoss"
2,The Museum of Icelandic Sorcery & Witchcraft,"Hólmavík, Iceland","Staves, storm-calling, and of course, necropants.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-museum-of-icelandic-sorcery-witchcraft-holmavik-iceland,"While witches are traditionally thought of as female, those accused of witchcraft in Iceland were traditionally male, but during a superstitious time in the country’s past, they were executed just the same. At Strandagaldur, the museum of Icelandic sorcery & witchcraft, these times of magic and fear are remembered in often shocking detail. The museum focuses on the elaborate and esoteric spells and rituals that the regional magic called for which would provide such effects as conjuring a creature to steal goat’s milk or making someone invisible. The collection features a number of artfully displayed original artifacts and entertaining replicas such as rune-carved pieces of wood, animal skulls, and a number of Icelandic magical staves. However, the most shocking and remarkable piece is easily the so-called “necropants“ which is the dried skin of a man from the waist down. These horrifying leggings were used in a spell that would supposedly bring the caster more money. The museum also features a display of an undead skeleton breaking up through the floor to further explicate the terror sorcery once caused the local people. Strandagaldur stands as a graphic reminder that while witchcraft has been feared the world over, Iceland really turned sorcery into something terrifying."
3,Hvítserkur,Iceland,Rising from the sea like a stone monster.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hvitserkur,"Hvitserkur, which translates to “white shirt” and derives its name from being covered in Shag and Cormorant guano, rises 15 metres, or nearly 50 feet from the sea. It was once the plug of a volcano, but over the years the craters surrounding the rock plug gave way to the pounding Atlantic Ocean leaving only the unusual outcropping Hvítserkur behind. Curiously, Hvítserkur itself would have given way to the ocean as well, had its foundations not been shored up with concrete some years ago. Icelandic legend has it that the rock was a troll who forgot to retreat from the light and was turned to stone in the sunrise, though from some angles it is said to look like a dragon drinking from the water. The geological oddity was commemorated on an Icelandic stamp in 1990."
4,Gljúfrabúi,"Hamragarðar, Iceland",This fantastical waterfall is hidden in a cave located in a cracked cliff.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gljufrabui,"Waterfalls can make for some of the most magical vistas in the world as they carve solid rock into often incredible formations. Such is the case with Iceland’s Gljúfrabui waterfall, which is almost completely hidden behind a cliff face. The waterfall has carved a mossy cylindrical chamber into the rock which can only be reached through a thin crack in the outside cliff wall. Once through the crack, explorers are hit with the incredible majesty of the hidden waterfall as it crashes into a pool at the base of the cave. The interior of the cave is nearly completely covered in a thin carpet of greenery thanks to its continually moist surroundings. These clandestine waterworks distill the natural wonder of Iceland’s scenic beauty.  This waterfall is easily accessible from Route 249 is a short distance off the Route 1 Ring Road in Iceland. It is a few hundred feet past the more famous Seljalandsfoss."
5,Kerid Crater Lake,Iceland,This eye-popping Icelandic crater lake is surrounded by red volcanic rock.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kerid-crater-lake,"In Iceland, you can’t just have a stunning lake. No, it also has to be inside of a volcanic caldera. And sometimes that’s not even enough, so the showiest country in the world provides something like Kerid Crater Lake, which is a nearly neon blue lake sitting in a volcano surrounded by rare red volcanic rock. Located in southern Iceland along the so-called Golden Circle, Kerid is unique among crater lakes in that its caldera likely didn’t form from an explosion as most do. The Kerid volcano is thought to have formed when the magma in the center simply depleted itself, and the empty chamber beneath caved in. Regardless of the geological minutia that led to the lake’s creation, its bright rainbow of colors look unearthly. In addition to the bright, sapphire-colored waters, the steep slopes of the caldera’s bowl are almost entirely covered in red volcanic rock. There is one, less-steep side of the slope that is covered in rich green moss, as though the lake weren’t colorful enough. During winter, however, Kerid transforms from a vibrant place to a hotspot of Icelandic desolation and starkness. In truth, it’s no less beautiful or impressive in winter, just different. The lake itself freezes over and becomes a giant ice rink for the most adventurous tourists. The rest of the crater, like the surrounding landscape, is caked in ice and snow. Though bleak, it’s perhaps easier to feel the vastness and raw power of the natural forces that govern Iceland. The lake can be visited along with tours of the Golden Circle, just try not to lose yourself in its beautiful blue eye.  In the southern part of the Golden Circle, the crater is located 15 km north of Selfoss, right off highway 35. It costs 400 kronur to enter and walk around the rim. You will get an informational brochure.  The parking lot is small and often fills up and there are no facilities available."
6,Hallgrimskirkja,"Reykjavik, Iceland","One of the tallest buildings in Iceland, and perhaps, the most visually impressive.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hallgrimskirkja,"Rising 244 feet above the streets of Reykjavik is Hallgrimskirkja. The building is situated in the capital city’s center and has become one of Reykjavik’s best-known symbols. The Lutheran church has a stylized concrete exterior inspired by the distinctive basalt formations found throughout Iceland, such as the waterfall Svartifoss. This gives the building an appearance more akin to a spaceship than a place of worship and makes it a unique feature of Reykjavik’s skyline. Although construction began in 1945, the church took 38 years to build, as many parts of the church were consecrated and in use at different times. Besides its stunning exterior, its most famous feature inside is a huge organ that was built in Germany in 1992, boasting 5,275 pipes. It is 15 meters tall and weighs 25 tons. Along with an exploration of the inside of the Hallgrimskirkja, the bell tower, which is accessible via an elevator, provides the best views in the city. A hidden gem is the large stained glass window above the church entrance. From the outside the window isn’t done justice, it’s only when you see it with natural backlight that you really see its beauty. The window is on the tower’s second floor, accessible through stairs on the right-hand side of the entrance. There is also a statue of Leif Ericksson in front of the church, a gift from the United States in 1930. The statue predates the actual construction of the church and was given to Iceland in commemoration of the 1000 year anniversary of Althingy, the Icelandic parliament at Thingvellir in 930A.D. Perhaps the best time of year to see Hallgrimskirkja is New Year’s Eve. Icelanders and tourists alike gather in the square in front of the church to count down towards midnight and welcome in the New Year. A huge fireworks display takes places all across Reykjavik, with a particular focus above Hallgrimskirkja. The results are spectacular and the church really comes alive, illuminated by the dazzling colours.  There is an admission fee for the tower, which is only accessible via a lift. It is ISK 1,000 (Icelandic króna) for adults and ISK 100 for children, which is payable at the church's gift shop."
7,Jökulsárlón,Iceland,Iceland's largest lagoon is home to stunning multi-colored icebergs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/joekulsarlon,"Despite the splendor of Jökulsárlón’s light blue and milky-white icebergs, the beauty of the glacial pool in southeastern Iceland is bittersweet. As the melting of nearby glaciers has accelerated, the landscape grows both increasingly stunning and fragile. Since the 1970s, the melting glaciers have grown the Jökulsárlón lagoon to be four times larger, now measuring at 11.1 square kilometers wide. Formed entirely from glacial melt, Jökulsárlón is situated directly next to Iceland’s largest glacier, Vatnajökull, which covers eight percent of the country. As chunks of ice break off Vatnajökull, they float atop the icy blue waters of this whimsical glacial lagoon. Scientists estimate that the continued rate of melting of Vatnajökull will cause a massive fjord to exist where the glacier once stood, again adding to the natural beauty of Iceland’s landscape, but doing so at a great environmental expense. A visit to Jökulsárlón has become a must for Iceland bound travelers keen on seeing the lagoon that has become popularized in such films as “A View to a Kill,” “Die Another Day,” “Tomb Raider,” and “Batman Begins.” For those keen on seeing the Aurora Borealis, Jökulsárlón is a fantastic place to watch the Northern Lights. Photographers will often come and set-up their tripods before sunset.  Jökulsárlón is located between Skaftafell National Park and Höfn, in southern Iceland and is only accessible by car or bus. Travelers can rent a car from Keflavik Airport, outside Reykjavík, or may book one of the many available tours to in Reykjavík to Jökulsárlón and other Golden Circle highlights. Upon arrival at Jökulsárlón, travelers will find available zodiac boat tours that take people on a tour of the glacial lagoon and up close to the Vatnajökull iceberg. If hungry, you'll also find a small cafe at Jökulsárlón with available snacks. For a more robust meal—and perhaps one of the only food options in the immediate area—drive 15 minutes east to Hotel Hali, which serves up Icelandic comfort food. Pro tip: For a stellar view nearby, leave the main parking lot, cross the bridge and park in one of the rocky pull-offs. Hike up and over the hills to get down to a private rocky beach that offers a fantastic vantage point for the Northern Lights."
8,Fjaðrárgljúfur,Iceland,Strange rock formations tower above the river that snakes through this enchanting Icelandic canyon.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fjadrargljufur,"Fjaðrárgljúfur (Fjadrargljufur in English) is a canyon a bit off the path off Iceland’s famous Ring Road. At just over a mile long, it certainly doesn’t boast the enormous expanses of the world’s other mighty canyons. But what it may lack in size, it absolutely makes up for in beauty. The canyon is made up of an assortment of crazy rock formations. They stretch skyward, flanking a river like gargantuan grass-clad guardians. A walking trail traces the top of the crags, leading to a certain spot that lets hikers feel as though they’re standing atop a kingdom of sublime natural wonders. When the river bled from the glaciers and carved its way through the land about two million years ago, it whittled out strange geologic patterns. The walls jut in and out, swerving back and forth so the water takes the shape of a blue snake slithering across the terrain. The majestic canyon slices through a patch of lush green earth. The river weaves through the verdant chasm, reflecting the colors of the sky and clouds above in its rippling water. The whole place has an enchanting feel. It’s the kind of landscape where you half expect to see elves or fairies peeking out from the many nooks and crannies. The canyon gains an even more evocative aura on a wet, dreary day when clouds cloak the sky and the river swells and surges with rain."
9,Bridge Between Continents,Iceland,Walk in the footsteps of the gods and straddle two tectonic plates.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/midlina-bridge-between-continents,"Iceland is slowly being pulled in two. At a rate of 2.5 centimeters per year, the mid-Atlantic ridge is pulling apart the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. While most of this happens deep on the ocean floor, in Iceland, the ridge—a major tectonic plate boundary that sits between the North American and Eurasian plates—runs right through the middle of the island. A large fissure can be seen running across the land and splitting rock formations down the middle. In the eerie, otherworldly landscape of the vast lava fields on the Reykjanes Peninsula, the “The Bridge Between Continents” bridge crosses one of these rifts created by the mid-Atlantic ridge. It’s also referred to as “Midlina.” The bridge was previously called “Leif the Lucky” bridge, named after the famous explorer Leif Ericson, who was known for being the first Icelander to set foot in North America over 1,000 years ago. It also serves as a symbol for the connection between two continents, Europe and North America, new world and old. On the midway point of the bridge, a plaque reads, “The Bridge Between Continents,” and it serves as a borderline between the Eurasian plate and North American plates. The two sides are marked: ″Welcome to America″ and ″Welcome to Europe.″ Despite the epic feeling you may have jumping across ancient continental boundaries as old as the Earth, the border is entirely symbolic."
10,The Arctic Henge,"Raufarhöfn, Iceland",This modern monument to pagan belief looks like it was transported straight from ancient times.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-arctic-henge-raufarhofn-iceland,"Located in one of Iceland’s most remote northern villages, the Arctic Henge is a colossal piece of stone construction that evokes neolithic monuments throughout the world. Started in 1996, the Arctic Henge project is a monument not only to the country’s Nordic roots, but also to some of the neo-pagan beliefs that have arisen in certain areas. The piece was inspired directly from the Eddic poem Völuspá (Prophecy of the Seeress), taking from it the concept of 72 dwarves who represent the seasons in the world of the poem, among other symbolic queues. In the Arctic Henge, 72 small blocks, each inscribed with a specific dwarven name will eventually circle four larger stone monuments, which in turn will surround a central balanced column of massive basalt blocks. Each aspect of the deliberate layout corresponds to some aspect of ancient Norse belief and when each piece of the monument is installed, visitors will be able to “capture the midnight sun” by viewing it through the various formations at different vantage points depending on the season. As of September 2021, the monument is still a work in progress. When it is complete, the Arctic Henge could easily become the premier site for Paganism in the entire world, and millennia from now it might seem as mysterious as Stonehenge seems to us today."
11,Dettifoss,Iceland,The most powerful waterfall in all of Europe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dettifoss,"In Iceland’s Vatnajökull National Park, the waters of the mighty Dettifoss are ever-crashing. The waters of the falls comes from the nearby Vatnajökull glacier, whose sediment-rich runoff colors the water a greyish white. The superlative of “most powerful” comes from its water flow coupled with its height. The falls, fed by the wide River Jökulsá, fall a total of about 150 feet, causing a massive, crashing spray. This can make getting close to the falls difficult. The pathways surrounding are frequently slippery, and authorities warn visitors to maintain a safe distance due to frequent accidents on the paths. This doesn’t stop visitors though. Dettifoss is the Niagara of Iceland and draws thousands of sightseers. The best view is by reaching the waterfall from the east. Bring rain gear if you want to get close!"
12,Thrihnukagigur Volcano,Iceland,Climb right into the heart of this colorful Iceland volcano.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thrihnukagigur-volcano,"Volcanos are usually things to be admired from a safe distance, but inside of most everyone is an excitable inner voice that really just wants to climb into that caldera and see what its like inside. Iceland’s Thrihnukagigur Volcano actually lets adventurous spelunkers live out that adolescent dream. Last erupting over 4,000 years ago the three calderas of Thrihnukagigur Volcano have lain dormant for so long that one of them is even safe to climb into. Unlike most dormant volcanos which simply cool with their previously roiling ocean of magma in place, creating one solid plug, the fathoms of magma that once boiled inside of one of Thrihnukagigur’s peaks seem to have simply sunk back down into the earth, leaving a massive, stunning cavern. Hiking out almost an hour into the Icelandic highlands, visitors can now approach the open summit and descend hundreds of feet into the main magma chamber via a cable lift. The main chamber is so large that according to the website, it could house the Statue of Liberty in its entirety. The craggy walls of the cavern are not the jet black obsidian that one might expect either, but instead they are covered in a gleaming pearlescent rainbow of colors that almost make the cave look as though it is made purely of gems. Each excursion into the volcano’s depths lasts around an hour or two, making the experience a bit truncated considering how incredible a feat it is to literally lower one’s self into a what was once one of the most impossible locations on Earth."
13,Icelandic Phallological Museum,"Reykjavik, Iceland",An encyclopedic collection of mammal penises.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/icelandic-phallological-museum,"Housing the worldʹs largest collection of penises, more than 320 penises from 115 species of mammal, the Icelandic Phallological Museum offers visitors a unique experience. It´s a family-friendly museum that has grown steadily and as of 2020 the presentation has been improved immensely. And now with a phallic themed bistro, they offer exclusive craft beers and dishes.  The museum is now located at Hafnartorg, but the entrance is on the corner of Geirsgata and Reykjastraeti."
14,Reykjadalur,"Hveragerði, Iceland","Iceland's ""Smoky Valley"" is a beautiful river that is shrouded in a constant cover of steam clouds.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/reykjadalur,"Located within the vicinity of the quaint town of Hveragerði, just 45 kilometers away from Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik, this smoke-shrouded, hidden valley is a part of one of the largest geothermal areas in the country. A popular local hiking trail leads into the valley after about an hour’s trek, which is eventually dominated by a gorgeous geothermal river. The river bank is reminiscent of a muddy expressionist painting due to the natural composition of the waters. Near boiling waters from a natural hot spring mix with cold river waters in the valley, creating hot baths that visitors can relax in. Many locals and visitors actually come here to bathe in the warm river but keep in mind there are no bathroom facilities so you’ll have to strip in the cool Icelandic air. Also, pay heed to the signs warning “Hætta!” (this means “Danger!” in Icelandic). Along the gravel path leading into the valley, not only will you see beautiful sights of waterfalls, but you’ll also find hot, bubbling (and yet beautiful) mud pools that reach temperatures of 100ºC. The steam rising from these pools pours over the hiking trail like a warm sulfur-smelling fog. Signs remind hikers to stay on the trail because flowing under the ground is hot, molten lava and you never know when a hot spring might erupt in your face. The town of Hveragerði is actually powered in part by the same geothermal energy that makes Reykjadalur such a haunting location. You can park your car in the parking lot right outside the northern part of the town, Hveragerði, where you can then take a path into the valley."
15,Godafoss,Iceland,This elegant arc of a waterfall marks a religious turning point.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/godafoss,"The story of the Goðafoss (Waterfall of the Gods) is that of Iceland’s remarkably democratic conversion to Christianity in the year 1000. The question before the Althing parliamentary assembly in that year was whether Iceland should embrace Christianity, or continue in “the old custom.” The assembled lawmakers were bitterly divided. According to the Íslendingabók, a civil war was narrowly avoided through the leadership of a man named Þorgeir Ljósvetningagoði. After a day and a night of meditation, Ljósvetningagoði, who was himself a pagan priest, decided in favor of Christianity. The compromise brokered by the Althing left pagans able to practice in private, even though Christianity became Iceland’s official religion. Following his monumental decision, Ljósvetningagoði formally converted to Christianity. To demonstrate his new faith, he threw idols of the old Norse gods into this waterfall, giving it its name. A thousand years later, a church named after Ljósvetningagoði was built nearby, complete with a stained glass window depicting his dramatic effigy disposal. Today, Godafoss remains one of the largest and most beautiful waterfalls in Iceland, running through Bárðardalur and Kinn in the country’s northeastern corner. At 30 meters wide and curving gently along a semicircular rim, it falls 12 meters into a frothing pool - a sight for the gods in more ways than one."
16,The Long Room Library at Trinity College,"Dublin, Ireland",The gorgeous library at Trinity College is home to remarkable treasures of Irish identity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-long-room-library-dublin-ireland,"Built between 1712 and 1732, the Long Room at Trinity College’s Old Library holds the collection’s 200,000 oldest books. The distinctive and beautiful barrel ceiling was added in 1860 to allow space for more works when the existing shelves became full. Marble busts of famous philosophers and writers line the central walkway of the nearly 200-foot-long room, created by sculptor Peter Schemakers beginning in 1743. The enormous collection housed in the long room includes a rare copy of the 1916 Proclamation of the Irish Republic and the 15th-century wooden harp in the library which is the model for the emblem of Ireland. By far its most famous holding, however, is an extraordinary illuminated manuscript known as the Book of Kells. Decorated with lavish Celtic and Christian iconography, its distinctive designs have become firmly rooted in Irish identity. Thought to have been created around 800 AD by Christian monks on the Isle of Iona in Scotland, it is composed of the four gospels, hand-transcribed on vellum in a script style known as “insular majuscule” or “insular script” which flourished in Ireland and Scotland between 600 and 850. It is named for the monastery at Kells, County Meath where the monks took refuge after a Viking raid and which became the manuscript’s home for centuries. The Book of Kells came to Trinity College in Dublin in 1661, for safekeeping after the Cromwellian raids on religious institutions. It has been on display since the 19th century."
17,St. Michan's Mummies,"Dublin, Ireland",An Irish church where an 800-year-old mummy is reaching out of his coffin as if to shake hands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-michans-church,"Down a set of dimly lit narrow stone steps, in a vault underneath the church, lay dozens of coffins, and one mummy ready to shake your hand. The mummies in the basement of St. Michan’s church in Dublin, Ireland, are really only available for viewing because of a loophole in the rules of the church. St. Michan Church has an interesting history even without the mummies. The foundation of the church was built in 1095 to serve the ostracized Vikings, who were still in Ireland after the rest had been killed or kicked out by Wolf the Quarrelsome and other Irish forces in 1014. The church was rebuilt in 1686, and a large pipe organ was installed in 1724, on which Handel is said to have first played the Messiah. But all along, as the church changed, the crypt stayed the same: slowly mummifying all that lay within it. There are a number of theories as to why the corpses in the basement have been preserved over time. One is that the basement contains limestone, making the basement particularly dry and therefore good for mummification. Another is that the church was built on former swamp land, and that methane gas is acting as a kind of preservative of the bodies. Other theories involve the presence of oak wood in the soil, or the building materials used in the church. Regardless of the reason, whatever is preserving the mummies is also disintegrating their coffins. After a certain amount of time, the wood falls away and a well-preserved mummy comes tumbling out. This is where the loophole comes in, for though it would be inappropriate for the Church to break open caskets looking for mummies, when the mummies reveal themselves, so be it. The mummies have indeed revealed themselves. While there are caskets strewn about and in small nooks in the wall—some coffins are falling apart enough to reveal an arm or leg—the most visible mummies are “the big four,” four mummified corpses which have no lids on their coffins and are displayed together. On the right is, a woman, simply called “the unknown,” and well, there isn’t much more to say about her. The middle one is known as “the thief” and is missing parts of both feet and a hand, some say the hand was cut off as punishment. It is believed the “thief” later converted and became a priest or respected man, which is why he is buried in the church. (Or possibly, he was never a thief at all and lost the hand in some other way…) Next to him on the left lies a small woman, thought to have been, and known as, “the nun.” But the true star here is the coffin set apart from the others and belonging to an 800-year-old mummy called “the crusader.” Though it may be apocryphal, it is believed that he was a soldier who either died in the crusades or returned and died shortly thereafter. (This assumes that these were the fourth crusades, the only ones that match with a date of 800 years old. Curiously, the fourth crusades turned into a kind of piratical free for all, ending in the sacking of Constantinople, without the permission of the church. The Crusader was quite tall for the time, six and a half feet tall, a giant back then, and his legs have been broken and folded up under him to fit him into his small coffin. His hand stretches out of the casket slightly and visitors were once encouraged to give it a shake. The crypt also holds the coffins of the Sheare brothers who were executed by the British—and as was discovered recently drawn and quartered as well—for the Rising of 1798, as well as mathematician William Rowan Hamilton, the many Earls of Kenmare, and supposedly, though others claim him too, the remains of Robert Emmet, the Irish rebel killed by the British in 1803. The crypt is said to have been visited by a young Bram Stoker, inspiring a certain morbid streak that would later serve quite well for the author. Update July 2019: In February 2019, the crypt was broken into and desecrated. The head of the 800-year-old Crusader was stolen, the nun’s body was decapitated, and another body was turned over. An Garda Síochána detained and questioned a man in relation to the desecration and theft. The head and other bones were recovered and sent to the National Museum of Ireland for safekeeping as they had sustained water damage during the commission of the crime. After undergoing special conservation at the National Museum Ireland, the skull has been returned and St. Michan’s will be open for tours again.  As of July 2017, you can no longer touch any of the mummies."
18,Skellig Michael,"Kerry, Ireland",Perfectly preserved ancient monastery in an impossibly dramatic location on a rocky island in the Atlantic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skellig-michael,"“An incredible, impossible, mad place. I tell you the thing does not belong to any world that you and I have lived and worked in; it is part of our dream world.” – George Bernard Shaw Skellig Michael is a remote, precipitous, rocky island situated eight miles from the coast of County Kerry, Ireland. It is the larger of two jagged islands that jut out from the swell of the Atlantic Ocean and thrust 230 meters straight up. Legends tell of the importance of the islands in prehistoric, pagan times, but the known history of Skellig Michael begins when a monastery was founded near the summit in the middle of the 7th century. Consisting of distinctive ‘beehive’ stone huts clustered around an oratory and a tiny vegetable garden, this was truly a place of solitude for the few monks who lived here, only accessible by climbing 600 stone steps up the cliff. Perched on the higher, southern peak of the island is another oratory, intended for a single monk seeking true isolation amongst the cathedral-like rocky spires. The monastic peace was shattered in the 9th century when a number of Viking raids threatened the very existence of this tiny community. But despite this, the monastery survived up until the 12th century when the monks abandoned the island and moved to the mainland. The monastery itself is remarkably well preserved, with daily boatloads of visitors from the mainland making the precarious leap to the small harbor at the bottom of the cliff. The extreme inaccessibility and remote location of these buildings have meant that just a trickle of tourists have visited the site, thus minimizing the erosion of the paved steps and terraces. The smaller of the two islands, Little Skellig, is no less dramatic. Situated a little closer to the shore, the island is Ireland’s largest Gannet colony, with over 20,000 breeding pairs. Skellig Michael is also home to a variety of species such as puffins, gannets, razorbills, and grey seals. The island, once relatively little known, was thrust into fame when the precarious steps, cliffs and beehive houses at the top were used as the setting for Luke Skywalker’s isolated hideaway at the end of Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens and, again in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The island can expect a steady stream of Jedi carrying lightsabers up the winding path.  Landing trips to the island operate between mid-May and early October, weather permitting. Fifteen boats are licensed to carry 12 passengers each so numbers are extremely limited. Contact details are published by the Office of Public Works. It's a mildly challenging walk up the 618 steps to the monastery at the top of the island so be prepared with grippy shoes, layered clothing, waterproofs for the boat, water, and food. Also, there are no toilets on the island. There are also eco-tours that take visitors on a water-based adventure without leaving the boat, getting up close to Skellig Michael to observe local wildlife. Star Wars has now massively increased interest in the island so it's advised to book months in advance. Or, failing that, make contact with a local accommodation provider who may have connections with one of the boatmen."
19,Dunmore Cave,"Kilkenny, Ireland","This Irish show cave is said to have been the site of a Viking massacre that claimed 1,000 lives.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dunmore-cave,"For centuries the relatively small Dunmore Cave has been fascinating writers, archeologists and explorers, and while it’s open to visitors today as a lovely bit of geology, it is possibly most famed as the site of a Viking massacre. The limestone cave, located in County Kilkenny, has been known to modern archeologists since the mid-1800s when the first serious expedition into the depths of the cave was undertaken, however the site was known for centuries prior. The first mention of the cavern is in a 9th century Irish triad poem where it is mentioned as one of the “darkest places in Ireland.” The next mention of the cave is the most sensational, however, where the cave gets named in a 17th century manuscript as the site of a Viking battle that took place in 928 CE that racked up 1,000 casualties. While pieces of gold and silver have famously been found in the depths of the cave, researchers have also found a number of human remains that give some credence to the tale of a massacre (although certainly not enough to prove 1,000 people were killed there). Since the 1960s the cave has been open as a show cave for visitors to explore. A small amount of safety infrastructure was installed including a roof over the cave mouth to prevent debris from raining down as people enter. However there has been no talk of what’s being done about the souls of the restless nords lingering in the air."
20,Irish Sky Garden,"Skibbereen, Ireland","This floating garden in the sky is straight out of a fairy tale, but the real thing is nothing short of magical.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/irish-sky-garden,"The Irish Sky Garden’s name describes what to expect fairly well, but seeing this patch of nature suspended in the air, juxtaposed against the clear blue sky, is far more whimsical and mesmerizing than visitors expect. Designed by American James Turrell, this magical knoll is the perfect symbol for the Emerald Isle, and it’s an unparalleled piece of public art. Turrell is famed for his large-scale experimentations with light and space, challenging the viewer to engage with the boundaries and wonder of human perception. The Sky Garden is set against the natural landscape of the Celtic Liss Ard, or “High Fort,” an ancient structure half reclaimed by nature which lends its own fairytale whimsy to the location. So even though the sky garden is a contemporary piece of art with a strikingly postmodern shape and aesthetic, it is the perfect complement to a place that is already a bridge between two worlds. Shaped like a bowl, the structure features a central stone plinth reminiscent of ancient Celtic and Egyptian altars. The altar rises up at an angle, and features two stone footrests on each end to allow the viewer to lie down facing up and out toward the edge of the crater above. All that is visible from this vantage point is the green grass and sky, creating a uniquely serene experience that invokes past rituals and ancient rites. According to Turrell, “the most important thing is that inside turns into outside and the other way around, in the sense that relationships between the Irish landscape and sky changes.” If you have ever struggled to empty your mind during meditation, a moment alone in the Sky Garden may be the closest you’ll come to achieving optical and aural harmony."
21,The Glen,"Sligo, Ireland",A tiny microvalley etched into the side of Knocknarea Mountain hides another world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ireland-glen-knocknerea,"There are arboretums, and then there are herb gardens. There are mountains, and then there are hills. And in Ireland, there are glens, and then there is The Glen. If a glen is a small valley, then The Glen is something else. One might coin the term “microvalley” just to describe this place. Walking through the rusty iron gate that leads you out of the wind and into the tranquility of The Glen, with its lush and dewy silence – every experience you’ve ever described as being “as if in a fairy tale” will be replaced by this. Nestled between sheer rock walls reaching heights of 60 feet, rare visitors to this enchanted glen are overwhelmed by vibrant hues of slate and green, surrounded by hanging vines and ivy-covered stone, ancient trees and mossy rock. And how fitting that this secret gully be etched into the side of Knocknarea Mountain – a place with fairy tales all its own. Knocknarea is a popular hiking destination filled with Irish lore. It’s topped with a massive pile of stones known as Queen Maeve’s Tomb – supposedly the final resting place of the mythical Queen Maeve. Hikers frequently visit the site to pay homage and take in the countryside. Yet even with that, The Glen is largely unknown and little-visited. The Glen is a geological oddity lacking a commonplace explanation, but it seems likely that the deep crevasse was carved out by a particularly ill-tempered glacier eons ago. Visitors will have to know where to look along the road to Knocknarea Mountain, where just past an old well and nearly eclipsed by overgrown flora, a simple but intriguing gate marks the entrance to another world – Queen Maeve’s own secret garden.  Travel along Glen Road on the southern slope of Knocknarea Mountain, past the turn-off for the Queen Maeve's Grave parking lot. About a half-mile down, on the right-hand side of the road, you'll see an old well (easily missed) surrounded by a low, circular white/gray wall. Roughly opposite the well is an overgrown and barely visible steel gate. That is the entrance. Wellies or muck-proof shoes are recommended as the path into and through the valley can be extremely muddy.  Be aware this is on private land (though it is not posted as such) and the owner is not okay with trespassers."
22,Victor's Way Indian Sculpture Park,"Wicklow, Ireland",An eccentric garden of sculptures crafted in India decorate an Irish green space dedicated to Alan Turing.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/victoria-s-way-indian-sculpture-park,"The unusual spiritual visions of an Irishman were created in stone by craftsmen in Mahabalipuram, India, and now populate a sculpture park in County Wicklow, Ireland. Covering 22 acres, the park includes a series of dancing figures of Ganesh, Shiva, and other Hindu deities. It also includes more bizarre sculptures of a skeletal Buddha-like figure, an enormous disembodied finger, and a sculpture called “The Split Man” which shows a figure ripping itself in two, representing “the mental state of the dysfunctional human.” Intended to represent the spiritual progression to enlightenment, this collection of 14 statues took 20 years to complete. A plaque dedicates the park to mathematician Alan Turing. The park was known as Victoria’s Way until 2015, when it was closed by the owner, who stated, “Too may day-trippers came turned it into a fun park for parents with children. It was designed as a contemplative garden for over 28’s.” It was reopened in 2016 as Victor’s Way (reverting to its original name) with new age restrictions.  From Dublin take the N11 south towards Wicklow. Turn right at Kilmacanogue towards Glendalough. After about 7 miles turn right towards Sally Gap (Route 759). At the first crossroad (after 600 yards) turn left towards Roundwood. Youll find the Indian Sculpture Park @ Victoria's Way, 300 yards up the road on the left.Admission is €5 per adult. Victor is usually outside by the small shed where you pull up to and if he is not there he is probably out within the park; Use the Honesty Box."
23,Brigit's Celtic Garden,"Galway, Ireland",The world of the ancient Celtic civilization explained through a bewitching 11 acre garden.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brigits-celtic-garden,"Themed on the Celtic seasonal festivals, Brigit’s Garden is widely regarded as one of the most spectacular gardens in Ireland, set within 11 acres of native woodland & wildflower meadows. A walk through the gardens is a journey through the cycle of the year, each garden representing one of the Celtic festivals: Samhain, Imbolc, Bealtaine and Lughnasa. This seasonal cycle mirrors the cycle of life from conception to old age and death. These are wildlife gardens, designed to reflect the West of Ireland landscape and managed to encourage biodiversity. The Garden’s features include: a Celtic nature trail, Celtic writings and ogham trees, children’s discovery trail, living willow play area, an ancient Celtic ring fort (fairy fort), Neolithic roundhouse and Celtic calendar sundial – the largest in Ireland – and the Iron Age roundhouse and standing stone circle and Crannog.  Brigit's Garden is located at the gateway to Connemara, 2km (1 mile) from the N59 between Moycullen and Oughterard, just a 20 minute drive north of Galway city. It is well signposted from the main road."
24,Newgrange,"Dowth, Ireland",The ancient tomb acts as a calendar that keeps perfect time.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/newgrange,"Newgrange is one of a number of ancient tombs in the Boyne Valley in the Irish county of Meath, north of Dublin. Built circa 3200 B.C., during the Neolithic era, it far predates Stonehenge and the Pyramids of Giza. A passage tomb, Newgrange was built with astronomical alignment. On the morning of the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, the central chamber is briefly illuminated by the rising sun’s rays coming through the passage. The surrounding area of this and other tombs is open to the public, and entry to the tomb is done with guided tours. On the morning of the Winter Solstice, there is a lottery to determine who can go and watch the event. The annual ticket lottery in 2007 had over 28,000 applications.  Access to Newgrange is only via the visitor center on the other side of the river, ensure you head there rather than to Newgrange itself. The visitor center is undergoing a major renovation and is closed until December 2019, only issuing tickets and toilet access. During this period, entry is free."
25,National Leprechaun Museum,"Dublin, Ireland",A museum that cashes in on its infamous little people while teaching you a thing or two about the Irish fey.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-leprechaun-museum,"The National Leprechaun Museum in Dublin is the first and only of its kind. It may be named after the wee little men with a pot of gold, but the museum is not focused merely on the worldwide fame of the Lucky Charms mascot. This one of a kind museum features exhibits on all kinds of folklore and mythology, bringing to life the long history of the faeries and other Irish legends. By day, this family friendly museum is a lighthearted journey through the myths of the Emerald Isle. The exhibits include the history of the leprechaun from the first sighting in the 8th century to Walt Disney’s visit to Ireland, where he found the inspiration for his 1959 film, Darby O’Gill and the Little People. The tour includes rooms full of incredibly over-sized furniture and other optical illusions, as well as an exhibit that features rainbows and pots of gold after a rain shower. Still others reveal cautionary tales, like what happens when you try to catch a leprechaun and additional stories of mishaps and tragedy like the Children of Lir. The tour mixes predictable exploitation of the infamous little legend with mysteries such as Newgrange and other lesser known Irish myths. It ends in an all-too-bright gift shop full of tourist fare and glitter. The National Leprechaun museum is a wholesome and family friendly excursion, unless you take advantage of the after hours production of “The Dark Lands”. This night time adventure is led through the dark by guides who act out the bawdier and more adult themes found in Irish legends and is not suitable for small children. Audience participation is required in these evening shows."
26,Kilmainham Gaol,"Dublin, Ireland","One of Ireland's most infamous prisons for rebels including men, women and children.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kilmainham-gaol,"One of Ireland’s most infamous prisons was built in 1787 directly on the gallows - where public hangings had already taken place for years. These executions continued throughout its existence both inside the gates and out, including those that were the catalyst for Ireland’s emergence as an independent nation. Kilmainham Gaol was a working and silent prison that housed men, women, and children, and was in operation from 1787 until 1924. The youngest child imprisoned at Kilmainham was believed to have been just seven years old. In the years of the harshest famines, people would intentionally break the law to enter the Gaol, in the hopes that they would be fed while incarcerated, which led to severe overcrowding. Women and children were forced to sleep on the floor in the corridors with no blankets while men were squeezed into cells that held up to five people at a time. Kilmainham Gaol became notorious for its rebel prisoners. Irish Nationalists were sent in great numbers to the prison and almost every Irish Republican leader had been housed within its walls at one time or another, during its years of operation. Many were executed there as well. Many of the prisoners left haunting graffiti on the walls affirming their willingness to die as martyrs for their beliefs. A particularly powerful and prophetic verse by the Nationalist leader Padraig Pearse is scrawled on one of the cell walls: “Beware the Risen People / That have harried and held/ Ye that have bullied and bribed.” In 1916, during an event called the Easter Rising, Irish republican rebels took over the General Post Office and other locations in the heart of Dublin to protest being ruled by the British. They held their positions for six days before surrendering. When they did surrender, the leaders were sent to Kilmainham Gaol. Once there, they were tried in secret, found guilty, and executed by firing squad in the yard. All seven signatories on the Proclamation of Independence were shot at Kilmainham, including one who had just been married in the prison chapel and another who had to be tied to a chair due to his injuries. But the executions, intended to quell the nationalist uprising, had the opposite effect. A movement that had before been the interest of only a few gained momentum and strength as word spread about these martyr-like executions, eventually leading to independence for the majority of Ireland just a few years later. The prison closed its doors in 1924. Today Kilmainham has been restored and reopened to the public. It offers guided tours and houses a tea shop and a museum that spans three floors. Attractions include a major exhibition detailing the political and penal history of the prison and its restoration. Another large exhibition is on the history of Irish Nationalism and features some of the last words of the executed leaders of the 1916 rebellion. The tour of the prison includes a brief overview of both Irish history and the history of the Gaol itself. Access to the prison is limited and is allowed on guided tours only.  Public transport available - there's a bus stop located right outside the gaol or the Luas Red line tram drops off a short distance away."
27,Saint Audoen's Gate,"Dublin, Ireland",The enchanting archway is the only surviving portal into Dublin's lost medieval wall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-audoens-gate,"A great stone wall once hugged the edges of medieval Dublin, enveloping the city’s residents within its embrace. Tall and formidable, access to the city was only granted through the handful of arched gates that peppered the barrier. The wall and its gates were built in 1240 by Norman settlers. For centuries, the fortifications defended Dublin against invading clans and foreign people. In addition to being portals into the city, the gateways also served as tollbooths. As the years wore on, Dublin’s need to maintain its stoic perimeter decreased. Abandoned bits and pieces crumbled. Entire sections fell into disrepair. Eventually, parts of the wall were torn down and lost to time. Only one of the city’s historic gates exists to this day. Tucked behind a side of a church within a small stretch of surviving wall, Saint Audoen’s Gate (also sometimes called Saint Audoen’s Arch) leads to a narrow alleyway. It was restored in 1976, and today visitors can exit the historic center of the city through the gate and follow the winding medieval pathway to High Street and Cornmarket, where they can discover other extant portions of the lost city wall. Under renovation. You can peek through the plywood fence and see the gate"
28,Kingship and Sacrifice,"Dublin, Ireland",This permanent collection of preserved bodies taken from Irish bogs is one of the leading authorities on such morbid mummies.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kingship-and-sacrifice,"Located within the National Museum of Ireland, the permanent exhibition known as Kingship and Sacrifice is a grim collection of withered human sacrifices who were preserved by the natural peat in which they were buried, including the Cashel Man, the oldest bog body ever found that still had flesh on its bones. Starting in 2003, a research project known as the Bog Bodies Research Project was started at the museum, which brought a number of local corpses to the center that had been preserved for thousands of years. Ritual human sacrifice in ancient Ireland was not an uncommon practice, but the disposal of the victims often led to the remarkable preservation of their remains thanks to the unique earthen properties of peat. The bodies, despite being thousands of years old, still have blackened flesh clinging to their bones. The identity of the sacrificial victims remains unknown, but various hypotheses exist, including that they were deposed kings or shamans, simple commoners offered to appease the gods and guarantee harvests, and even “outsiders” such as adulterers and thieves who had broken taboos. In addition to the remarkable bodies dredged up from the muck, regalia and jewelry were found near the bodies, indicating the possibly exalted positions the sacrifices likely held, hence the name of the exhibition. Mummified bog bodies can be found all across the globe, but the blacked bodices on display are some of the only ones that are on actual public display.  It's inside the National Museum of Ireland on Kildare Street, next to the National Library of Ireland. It's 550 meters from the Trinity College entrance and 200 meters northward from the St Stephen's Green. Free entrance."
29,The Hungry Tree,"Dublin, Ireland",An 80-year-old plane tree is devouring an iron bench at Ireland's oldest law school.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-hungry-tree-dublin-ireland,"Most trees feast upon a steady diet of carbon dioxide, water, and sunshine, which they absorb through their roots and leaves. Some, though, like to absorb other things as well. The Hungry Tree in Dublin is an 80-year-old London Plane tree that’s currently in the process of devouring a cast iron bench. As the years have passed, the tree has grown, causing it to swallow the parts of the structure that stands in its way. Its gnarled bark now spills over the back of the bench, making it appear as though the seat is being sucked into the tree’s trunk. It isn’t the first tree to eat something that stood in its way. Other trees around the world have acted similarly when faced with an obstacle that intrudes upon their growth. Still that hasn’t stopped the Hungry Tree from being listed by the Tree Council of Ireland as one of Ireland’s Heritage Trees. The arboreal bench-eater is located within the grounds of The Honorable Society of King’s Inns, Ireland’s oldest school of law, established in 1541 during the reign of King Henry VIII. The grounds are open and accessible to the public and lead on to Henrietta Street, which along with King’s Inns itself has been used as a location for many films and TV dramas. Quickest access to The Hungry Tree is from the Constitution Hill entrance to King's Inns."
30,Drombeg Stone Circle,"Rosscarbery, Ireland",One of the most popular megalithic sites in Ireland stands as a humbler version of Stonehenge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/drombeg-stone-circle-2,"It sometimes seems as though every stray rock in the Irish countryside has some archeological significance, but formations such as the popular Drombeg Stone Circle show that the people of megalithic Ireland were building elaborate stoneworks. Also known as the “Druid’s Altar,” the circle is a megalithic formation that once consisted of 17 stones (only 13 remain) out in the countryside of Cork County, Ireland. Radiocarbon dating of human remains found at the site during a 1957 excavation suggests that the area was built and actively used between 1100-800 BC. Now the site is secluded, tucked away between verdant farmland and network of country roads. Approaching the stone circle requires walking a short way along a gravel path among high bushes that seem to hide the circle. But then the flat expanse of land opens and the stones rise from the landscape. Visitors expecting Stonehenge should think again. The Drombeg stones are mostly less than two meters high, and the stone circle is oriented along the southwest axis to line up with the midwinter solstice. Scattered across the nearby plain are several other relics including dwelling remains and the site of a primitive kitchen.  There are also the remains of a sacred well by the pathway. Given that this is one of the most visited sites of its kind in Ireland, parts of the land have been covered by gravel to preserve the area, but those interested can walk among the rocks and even touch the sacred stones that humans have revered for thousands of years.  The Drombeg Stone Circle is a little over an hour from Cork, Ireland by car. No public transit access exists. Leaving Cork, take N71 southwest through Bandon and Clonakilty (approximately 55km). Turn left onto R597, and follow for 4.2km. Turn left at the sign for Drombeg Stone Circle, and follow the road approximately 1km. Turn right into the parking lot."
31,The Lost Town of Newtown Jerpoint (Jerpoint Park),Ireland,Local legend says the remains of Father Christmas lie within the medieval grounds.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-lost-town-of-newtown-jerpoint-kilkenny-ireland,"What’s left of the abandoned medieval village of Newtown Jerpoint lies just outside the Irish town of Thomastown, in Kilkenny. The ruins of Saint Nicholas’ Church, which dates to sometime between the 12th and 13th centuries, still stand. Local legend has it that Saint Nicholas—a.k.a Father Christmas, the inspiration behind Santa Claus—is buried within a cracked, carved tomb in its grounds. According to local tradition, two Norman crusaders nabbed the saint’s remains while heading home to Kilkenny from the Holy Land over 800 years ago. Saint Nicholas’ supposed tombstone depicts a cleric with the heads of two knights peering over his shoulder, which represent the knights who carried the bones. Though it’s true that Norman knights from the area were part of the crusades, the theory that they stole and relocated Father Christmas isn’t widely accepted by non-locals. Newtown Jerpoint existed until sometime in the 17th century. Though it was once a bustling village with over a dozen taverns, the loss of its toll bridge and the re-routing of the local road eventually caused its residents to abandon it. Now, the ruined church and tomb exist within the privately owned Jerpoint Park, a working farm that offers tours, fishing, and sheep dog demonstrations.  Jerpoint is just 2.0 miles (3.2 km) southwest of Thomastown, and 15–20 minutes from the city center of Kilkenny."
32,Santa Maria della Concezione Crypts,"Rome, Italy","The crypts of Capuchin friars decorated with the bones of over 4,000 friars, including an entire ""crypt of pelvises.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/santa-maria-della-concezione,"In 1775, the Marquis de Sade wrote of it, “I have never seen anything more striking.” Granted, the crypt was to his tastes. Mark Twain wrote about it in his 1869 book Innocents Abroad. When Twain asked one of the monks what would happen when he died, the monk responded, “We must all lie here at last.” And lie there they do. Some 4,000 Capuchin friars who died between 1528 and 1870 are still lying, hanging, and generally adorning the Santa Maria della Concezione crypt in Rome. In 1631, the Capuchin friars, so-called because of the “capuche” or hood attached to their religious habit, left the friary of St. Bonaventure near the Trevi Fountain and came to live at Santa Maria della Concezione, of which only the church and crypt remain. They were ordered by Cardinal Antonio Barberini (the Pope’s brother and a member of the Capuchin order) to bring the remains of the deceased friars along with them to their new home so that all the Capuchin friars might be in one place. Rather than simply burying the remains of their dead brethren, the monks decorated the walls of the crypts with their bones as a way of reminding themselves that death could come at any time. A plaque in the crypt reads, “What you are now, we once were; what we are now, you shall be.” The ossuary contains a crypt of skulls, a crypt of leg bones, and perhaps the oddest—a “crypt of pelvises.” Mummified monks were dressed in friar’s clothes and hung from the walls and ceiling. With the addition of electricity, light fixtures were incorporated into some of the hanging monks, bringing a new meaning to the phrase “the eternal light.” A particular highlight of the crypt is the skeleton enclosed in an oval of bones holding a scythe and scales—tools made entirely out of, yes, bones. The crypt is said to have been the inspiration for Sedlec Ossuary in the Czech Republic.  All photography is prohibited."
33,Valle dei Mulini (Valley of the Mills),"Sorrento, Italy",An Italian crevasse filled with abandoned buildings gives visitors a look at the world without humans.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/valle-dei-mulini-valley-of-the-mills,"The “Valle dei Mulini,” or “Valley of Mills,” is a verdant grouping of modern ruins nestled at the bottom of a deep Italian crevasse. The deep crack in the rock which houses the crumbling buildings originated during a huge eruption which devastated the Mediterranean area 35.000 years ago. The flour mills, built from stone as far back as the 13th century,  took advantage of the constant stream at the bottom of the valley. They ground all the types of wheat needed by the Sorrentine people in the surrounding area. After the flour mills were successfully established, other early industrial outfits began springing up to take advantage of the waters at the bottom: a sawmill was built which furnished the chaff used by local cabinet-masters and there was a wash-house used by women for personal hygiene and laundering clothes. After the milling of flour was largely shifted to nearby pasta mills, the sunken area of industry became largely obsolete and the buildings were closed and abandoned in the 1940’s. Since their closing, the brick buildings have been slowly taken over by the aggressive greenery that thrives in the humid crevasse. The gorgeous buildings hidden in the Valley of the Mills look like nothing more than a slice of what the world will look like when humans are gone. Update: As of November 2019, the city has voted to restore the Mills, which is currently in progress.  The mills can be seen from Viale Enrico Caruso, which is suspended over the canyon and the intersection with Via Fuorimura."
34,Torre Argentina (Roman Cat Sanctuary),"Rome, Italy",Hundreds of lucky felines haunt the ruins where Caesar was murdered.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/torre-argentina-roman-cat-sanctuary,"In Rome the cats have an ancient temple-complex all to themselves. Known as Largo di Torre Argentina, this archaeological wonder was excavated as part of Mussolini’s rebuilding efforts in 1929, revealing four Republican victory-temples that lie sunken 20 feet below modern street level.  In addition to the remains of four different temples, Torre Argentina also contains part of the famous portico of Pompey. Today, volunteers at Torre Argentina care for approximately 130 cats, many of which are disabled or suffer from illness. After the site was excavated, Rome’s feral cats moved in immediately, as they do all over the city, and the gattare, or cat ladies, began feeding and caring for them. Since the mid-1990s, the population has grown from about 90 to a peak of 250, and the organization has ramped up with care for sick or wounded cats, as well as an extensive spay and neuter program to keep the feral population in check. Most of the permanent residents have special needs—they are blind or missing legs or came from abusive homes. On any given afternoon a small crowd gathers here to watch the cats sunbathe on ancient pillars and steps. At first it may be hard to spot the cats, but once you start to see them, they are everywhere. Visitors can admire the cats and their ruins from street level, or head down the steps to the underground office to volunteer, peruse the gift shop, donate, and even adopt cats. There is another Roman cat sanctuary located at the Protestant Cemetery, near the Pyramid of Cestius.  Entrance at Largo di Torre Argentina, corner of Via Florida & Via di Torre Argentina. The ladies who work here are very friendly to everyone. If you do spend any time within the closed off area where the wounded and aged cats stay (who are also very friendly to all), please consider a donation to the Sanctuary."
35,The Monsters of Bomarzo,"Bomarzo, Italy",A 16th-century horror show built in a lovely Italian garden.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-monsters-of-bomarzo-bomarzo-italy,"The Park of the Monsters, or “Parco dei Mostri,” in the Garden of Bomarzo was not meant to be pretty. Commissioned in 1552 by Prince Pier Francesco Orsini, it was an expression of grief designed to shock. The Prince, also known as Vicino, had just been through a brutal war, had his friend killed, been held for ransom for years, and come home only to have his beloved wife die. Racked with grief, the Prince wanted to create a shocking “Villa of Wonders” and hired architect Pirro Ligorio to help him do so. Ligorio was a widely respected architect and artist and had previously completed the Cathedral of Saint Peter in Rome after the death of Michelangelo, as well as the Villa d’Este in Tivoli. This was to be an unusual, but interesting job for him. The park is filed with bizarre and fascinating sculptures for which only the accompanying inscriptions provide any explanation. Among the pieces are a war elephant, a monstrous fish-head, a giant tearing another giant in half, and a house built on a tilt to disorient the viewer. Perhaps the most frightening piece in the garden is an enormous head, mouth opened wide in a scream. The accompanying inscription reads “all reason departs.” Built during the Italian Renaissance, the garden layout bore little resemblance to the symmetry of other Renaissance gardens, and the art was made in a rough “Mannerist” style, a sort of 16th-century version of Surrealism. It makes sense, then, that the Surrealists loved it. Salvador Dalí visited the park and loved it. He was so inspired, he shot a short film there, and the sculptures inspired his 1946 painting The Temptation of Saint Anthony. Jean Cocteau was also a fan of the park. Other artists followed, and a novel, libretto, and opera have all been based on the park. While there is no way of truly knowing how the Prince felt about the park, the final addition indicates that perhaps he was getting over his melancholy. Built 20 years after the park was begun, it is not a monster but a temple, built to honor his second wife. When you visit the park, be sure to enter the giant screaming mouth (known as “the mouth of hell”), inside which, on the tongue, stands a picnic table and enough seating for a small group to have lunch."
36,Libreria Acqua Alta,"Venice, Italy",This Venice bookstore has resigned itself to constant flooding by keeping its books in bathtubs and boats.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/libreria-acqua-alta,"Keeping a collection of books in a city where the roads are made of water is a dangerous idea to begin with, but Venice’s Libreria Acqua Alta has nothing to fear since they just keep all their titles in waterproof basins. The self-proclaimed “most beautiful bookstore in the world” is composed of a number of over-stuffed rooms stacked wall-to-wall with books, magazines, maps, and other ephemera. Due to Venice’s constant flooding, however, these picturesque piles are all placed inside bathtubs, waterproof bins, and in one room a full-size gondola. The name itself even means “Book Store of High Water.” When the local waterways rise to fill the store, the water can rise inches off the floor, which would destroy any other collection. The store’s whimsically cramped atmosphere is even reflected in their “fire escape,” which is simply a door leading directly out into a canal. To really complete the look, the store has become home to more than one stray cat, who are also able to escape the rising tides by hanging out atop the stacks."
37,Quartiere Coppedè,"Rome, Italy",Architectureal fantasy quarter of Rome.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/quartiere-copped,"Quartiere Coppedè is an unexpected and bizarre area in Rome, nestled within the Trieste district in the northern part of the city. The fantastical mix of Ancient Greek, Roman Baroque, Mannerist, Medieval, and, overall, Art Nouveau mishmash was brought to life by Florentine architect Gino Coppedè (from whom the quarter itself takes its current name) in 1919. Coppedè worked on the quarter until his death in 1927. Though the Art Nouveau palaces of Quartiere Coppedè, featuring floral, mythological and medieval details, are abundant, there is plenty of space for the fantasies of Coppedè in this vast area. “The 31,000 square meters of the quarter (with some 40 structures) are alive with Florentine towers and Venetian palazzi decorated with external mosaics and frescoes, Baroque Roman palazzi with real and imitation papal stemmata, a sundial, and even a building devoted to a musical decorative scheme whose exterior ironwork and carvings imitate musical notation” (Source). Thanks to its strange beauty, the Quartiere Coppedè has been used as the setting for a number of films, and is a fun way to leave the beaten path of Rome. You can reach Quartiere Coppedè by taking Tram 3 or 19 to Piazza Buenos Aires, which is a short walk to Piazza Mincio. While you're there, be sure to stop by Piazzo Mincio and check out the whimsical Fontana delle Rane (Fountain of Frogs), in which the Beatles famously dunked themselves after a concert in Rome.

38,Galleria Sciarra,"Rome, Italy",This hidden Art Nouveau courtyard is an opulent feast for the eyes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/galleria-sciarra,"Located just a few steps away from the iconic Trevi Fountain and the fashionable Via del Corso is a largely unknown courtyard that transports visitors back to the height of the Art Nouveau movement. Its gorgeous frescoes and brilliant colors are a feast for the eyes and a welcome change from the pale, faded ancient Roman ruins scattered throughout the city. The opulent courtyard was built in the late 19th century for the wealthy, influential Sciarra family. It was meant to be a shopping mall, which, had the mall come to fruition, would perhaps be one of the most beautiful shopping centers in Rome. Every inch of the four-story walls enclosing the space is covered by colorful frescoes of women and men surrounded by elegant, curling floral designs. The women are the main focus, as the gorgeous artwork, which was painted by Giuseppe Cellini, is intended to celebrate women in the various phases of life. The glass and iron ceiling lets sunlight spill into the courtyard, illuminating the details in the frescoes. When the sun goes down, lights turn on to bathe the courtyard in a warm yellow glow."
39,The Sunken City of Baia,"Baia, Italy",A submerged archeological park still holds the wonders of a Roman Sodom.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-sunken-city-of-baia-baia-italy,"In its heyday, the Classical Roman city of Baia was the hedonist Las Vegas of the time, but now its remains are partying beneath the waves. A prominent resort city for centuries, Baia catered to the recreational whims of the rich and powerful among the Roman elite. The city, which was located over natural volcanic vents, was famous for its healing medicinal hot springs which occurred all around the city and were quite easy to build spas over. Some of antiquity’s most powerful figures such as Nero, Cicero, and Caesar were known to have visited the city and a number of them actually built permanent vacation villas there. Unfortunately, the good times were not to last and the city was sacked by a Muslim army in the 8th century. By 1500, the remains of the formerly luxurious town were abandoned. After the city remains were emptied, the water level slowly rose due to the same volcanic vents that were once a draw to the area, and most of the ancient ruins were drowned under the shallow waters of the bay. Today the ancient remains of Baia can be visited in one of the world’s few underwater archeological parks. Visitors can view the crumbled structures and amazingly preserved statuary of the city through glass-bottomed boats, snorkeling, or even scuba dives which allow people to actually swim amongst the copious ruins. While the city is no longer a resort, its waters still hold wonders."
40,The Dome Illusion,"Rome, Italy","A master of trompe-l'oeil creates a stunning, tourist-fooling dome out of a flat ceiling.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dome-illusion,"The Jesuit church of Saint Ignazio was supposed to have a glorious dome, but when the money ran out in 1642, the plans were scrapped. Instead of forgoing the dome entirely, painter and Jesuit brother Andrea Pozzo proposed that he paint a life-sized illusion of a dome that would fool the eyes of visitors (as long as they looked up from the proper angle). His masterpiece, painted between 1685 and 1694, still deceives the eye today. Pozzo painted another illusion for the barrel-vaunted ceiling of Saint Ignazio. The huge painting depicting the life and works of Saint Ignatius lifts and expands the simple building skyward, using forced perspective to move the figures up into the heights. The technique is known as quadratura, a mixture of geometrically accurate architecture in forced perspective and elements of fantasy, like cherubs and floating saints. Pozzo wrote a book on the subject, Perspectiva Pictorum et Architectorum, which was very influential with other Baroque painters. Both the dome and the central illustration are painted on a single 17 meter canvas. His work on the illusions was so well received that he was granted the commission for the rest of the artwork in the church. In April of 1891 an enormous powder magazine explosion just outside the city rocked Rome and damaged the ceiling artwork. (It also collapsed part of the roof of the Parliament building and sent the city into a general panic.) A restoration in 1961 repaired the painted ceiling. In 1703, Pozzo repeated his dome illusion in Vienna, in a Jesuit church now called the University Church, and at the Church of the Gesù in Frascati, Italy.  The entrance to the church faces Piazza S. Ignazio. The best way to view the illusion is to enter the church keeping your eyes low until you reach the circular marble marker that indicates the ideal vantage point for taking in the “dome.” A second marker on the floor indicates the ideal viewing spot for the rest of the ceiling."
41,The Aventine Keyhole,"Rome, Italy",Rome's semi-secret peephole vista is also a former Crusader stronghold.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-aventine-keyhole-rome-rome-italy,"A nondescript green door at the end of a cul-de-sac features a stunningly well-framed, if comically tiny, view consisting of two nation-states and one country, with the dome of St. Peter’s perfectly situated in the center. The doorway in question leads to the Priory of the Knights of Malta, the legendary crusader knights and religious order. Although the property has been in their hands for centuries, the site has seen many occupants. It originally held a fortified palace belonging to Alberico II, the ruler of Rome from 932-954, then became a Benedictine monastery before passing first into the hands of the Knights Templar in the 1100s, then finally to their brothers in arms, the Knights of Malta, in the 1400s.  As it holds extraterritorial status, it is not technically “Italy” within the walls. The elegant building seen today is a small church known as Santa Maria del Priorato. It is the 18th-century handiwork of the famous architect and engraver Giovanni Battista Piranesi, also known for his romantic etchings depicting the city and for his dark and enigmatic series of imaginary prisons (Carceri d’Invenzione). The church’s architectural motifs evoke ships and the sea, inspired by the longstanding tradition of comparing the Aventine Hill to a ship. The design also incorporates many esoteric and Masonic symbols. Piranesi was buried at the Priory after his death in 1778. The estate also houses the Embassy of the Order of Malta to Italy. The keyhole vista lines up perfectly with the garden, centered on the Vatican in the distance. No one seems to be able to say with certainty whether this was a beautifully planned peepshow—or just a lucky coincidence.  At the intersection of via di S. Sabina and via di Porta Lavernale on the Aventine hill. The gardens themselves can be viewed by appointment only. Be sure to make a reservation in advance."
42,Porta Alchemica,"Rome, Italy","An alchemist's ""magic door"" stands in the middle of a Roman park.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/porta-magica,"While this “magic door” is famous to Romans, it is barely noticed by tourists visiting Rome. But in the central district of Piazza Vittorio, inside the park, the remains of an old villa reveal a Magic or Alchemist Door, a portal into the real and secretive world of 1600s alchemy. Full of symbols and inscriptions, it was built during the early 1600s by the Roman marquis Massimiliano Palombara, a member of a group of people known as “The Alchemists of Palazzo Riario” who congregated around the Roman court of Christina, the Queen Regent of Sweden. Christina was an ardent supporter of alchemy and science, and thinkers and science luminaries like Rene Descartes and Athanasius Kircher were often found in her Italian court along with alchemy enthusiasts like Palombara. The Porta Alchemica is the only remaining of five doors to Palombara’s villa. According to legend, the Marquis met an alchemist at a dinner party who told him he could use a certain herb to turn metals to gold. In the morning the alchemist (said to be Giuseppe Francesco Borri, a sort of alchemical Zelig) was gone but had left behind some gold flakes, evidence apparently of his successful transformations, and an indecipherable sheet, the “recipe” for the transformation. Because the Marquis was unable to read it he inscribed the recipe on his doors in the hope that someone who could understand it would see it and come knocking. Mystery and occult beliefs still surround the door, and a cryptic symbol above the doorway fuels many of these theories. But of course, to most visitors to Rome, it’s just another mysterious ruin. Update as of November 2019: The park is currently under construction and inaccessible. Update as of January 2020: Still under construction and inaccessible.  Take Metro A (Vittorio), Tram 13, 5, or Bus 105. As of April 2018, it was visible, though at a distance behind a locked iron gate."
43,The Mouth of Truth,"Rome, Italy",The yawning maw of this pagan visage is said to bite off the hands of liars.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mouth-of-truth-rome-italy,"Long before the modern lie detector and its harmlessly jittering graphs and wires were invented, the superstitious and untruthful faced a much more severe fate between the jaws of the Bocca della Verità, or Mouth of Truth, an ancient carving which is said to bite the hands off of liars. While no one is exactly sure when or why the frieze was created, there are a number of theories. Dating back to around the 1st century CE, the Mouth of Truth is a tall stone disc carved into a humanoid face with hollow holes for eyes and its gaping mouth. The original purpose of the large medallion has been theorized as everything from a ceremonial well cover, to a piece of fountain decoration, to a manhole cover. The face itself has been said to represent a pagan god although exactly which one is up for debate with scholars guessing at everyone from forest god Faunus, to sea god Oceanus, to a local river god. While the origin is up for debate the one unifying legend surrounding the stone carving is that if one were to stick their hand inside the disc’s mouth and tell a lie, the rocky maw would bite the offending hand off. This belief seems to have originated during the Middle Ages when the disc was supposedly used during trials having the accused put their hand in the slot and if found to be untruthful a hidden axeman would lop off the appendage. While this use seems to be apocryphal, the superstition persists to this day. The Mouth of Truth, which now rests outside the doors of the Basilica di Santa Maria in Cosmedin, has been used as a whimsical lie detector in a number of movies and video games, most famously in the 1953 romance, Roman Holiday, in which the carving was a major plot device.  You can choose your own attire to visit The Mouth of Truth, but if you decide to enter the church and see St. Valentine's Skull, you'll want to make sure your shoulders and knees are covered. If not, you'll wear a plastic tarp over your shoulders or be denied entrance."
44,The Mad Colored Houses of Burano,"Venice, Italy",This community on a small Venetian island has taken to painting their houses in bright neon hues.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mad-colored-houses-of-burano-venice-italy,"The fisherman’s island of Burano sits in the Venetian lagoon and, like most of Venice, is run through by a system of canals. While Venice can take on a melancholy feel, Burano’s cheery and brightly painted houses stand out. Burano is made up of a group of four small islands linked together by a series of bridges and held together even more solidly by their colorful painting trend. The eye-catching color scheme has been upheld for decades and was even beginning to fade until recent years when the practice was reinstated. Now, Burano’s houses pop with bright colors that almost look photoshopped as the homes are repainted every two years. Each house is painted a different color from its neighbors and in fact, anyone that wants to paint their place needs to get approval from the local community government first. In addition to its uniquely painted houses, Burano is renowned for its quality lacework and even boasts a Museum of Lace, although photography is prohibited on the premises. The Museum of Lace may be the only place in the little neighborhood where photography is outlawed as groups of visiting photographers are a regular sight on the streets of this tiny albeit colorful island.  To get to Burano, you'll have to take the Vaporetto (number 12) from the Fondament Nove in Venice. The 40-minute Vaporetto ride will make a stop in Murano—an island known for its glass blowing and well worth a visit—before continuing on to Burano."
45,Galileo's Middle Finger,"Florence, Italy",The middle finger of modernity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/galileos-middle-finger,"It is a remarkable bit of irony, the finger: venerated, kept in a shrine, subjected to the same treatment as a saintly relic. But this finger belonged to no saint. It is the long bony finger of an enemy of the church, a heretic. As with a fine wine, it took some years for Galileo’s finger to age into something worth snapping off his skeletal hand. The finger was removed by one Anton Francesco Gori on March 12, 1737, 95 years after Galileo’s death. Passed around for a couple hundred years it finally came to rest in the Florence History of Science Museum, which has since become the Galileo Museum. In 2009 two more fingers and a tooth belonging to Galileo were discovered at an auction. The spare parts had disappeared in 1905, not seen for 100 years. But then the purchaser was able to deduce their origin, and has returned them to the Science Museum where they match a detailed description from when they were last seen. Today the middle finger sits in a small glass egg among lodestones and telescopes, the only human fragment in a museum devoted entirely to scientific instruments. It is hard to know how Galileo would have felt about the final resting place of his finger. Whether the finger points upwards to the sky, where Galileo glimpsed the glory of the universe and saw God in mathematics, or if it sits eternally defiant to the church that condemned him, is for the viewer to decide. Galileo’s middle finger has since been joined by his index finger, thumb, and tooth enclosed in a bell jar."
46,The Mithraeum at Circus Maximus,"Rome, Italy",The underground sanctuary of a mysterious ancient cult.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mithraeum-at-circus-maximus-rome-italy,"One of the largest secret Mithraic temples in Rome is hidden next to the famous Circus Maximus. Discovered in 1931 as part of Rome’s fascist-era building projects, the small subterranean space was once dedicated to the mystery cult of the god Mithras. Although several mithraeums have been discovered throughout the ancient holding of the Roman Empire, including sites in London, and several in Germany, France, and Hungary, little is known about the actual religious practices of the movement’s followers. The Mithraic Mysteries emerged and gained popularity throughout Rome between the 1st and 4th centuries. The cult and religious sanctuaries were open only to initiates, and their rituals secret. The central imagery is of the god Mithras slaying a bull, a motif known as “tauroctony,” found in most if not all mithraeums. Some trace the origins of the cult to the Iranian god Mitra, based on statements made by 3-4th century AD philosopher Porphyry, but some question whether he actually knew what he was talking about. In any event, the cult died out at the end of 4th century as Christianity began to gain momentum. Mithraeums were often underground, sometimes built into natural caves. The central chamber was dark and windowless, in contrast to the open and bright structure of most early Roman temples. The structures are small and intimate, designed to hold only 30-40 people as a place of secret ritual prayer, sacrifice, and ritual meals of bread and wine. The mithraeum under Circus Maximus is accessible by appointment only. The site dates to the 2nd century AD, and features five parallel but separate chambers with a central sanctuary paved in white marble, with two niches for statues of Caute and Cautopates, and a place of honor which would have held a statue of Mithras."
47,Pyramid of Cestius,"Rome, Italy","The only ""Egyptian"" pyramid in Europe and the legendary tomb of Remus.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pyramid-of-cestius,"Egyptomania gripped Rome in the wake of the conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. Both massive original artifacts and inspired copies cropped up all over the city, but only two actual pyramids were known to have been built, and only one remains. The Pyramid of Cestius was most likely built between 18 and 12 BC. The 36 meter (about 120 feet) high pyramid was built as a tomb for a wealthy Roman under the sway of all things Egyptian. Little is known about the man who may have once been buried here, since the tomb was long ago ransacked and the land around it has changed dramatically over the centuries. Now at the edge of a busy traffic intersection near a major train stop, originally the pyramid was well outside of the center of the city, surrounded by stately columns and two bronze figures (now in the Musei Capitolini). The pyramid rises at a much sharper angle than the famous pyramids in Egypt. This may have been due to incorrect information on the Egyptian front, innovation on the part of the Roman builders who, using concrete as a building material, were able to more steeply, or they may have been inspired by the steeper Nubian pyramids near Jebel Barkal, now in Sudan. In any event, the unusual proportions of this pyramid close to home has been credited as the source of oddly proportioned pyramids in European art supposedly depicting the Egyptian originals. During this craze for all things Egyptian the famous obelisks began to appear in the city. Two of them dating from this period still stand - one in the Piazza del Popolo, and the second in the Piazza di Montecitorio (though neither one stands in its original location). In addition to obelisks and other Egyptian imports there was actually another, larger pyramid in Rome, known as the “Pyramid of Romulus” near the Castel Sant’Angelo. This pyramid did not survive the building crazes of later generations, and its marble was used in the building of the stairs at St. Peter’s Basilica. The Pyramid of Cestius is constructed of brick and cement, covered in white marble. Originally the interior of his tomb was decorated with lively frescoes, described in detail by early travelers, but now mostly gone. Between 271 and 275 it was built into the fortifications of the Aurelian walls, which likely helped it survive the centuries. The inscription on the southeast side of the pyramid reads: “Gaius Cestius Epulo, son of Lucius, of the Poblilian district, praetor, tribune of the people, official of the public banquets. According to his will, this work was completed in three hundred and thirty days; it was executed by his heirs L. Pontus Mela, son of Publius, of the Claudian district, and his freedman Pothus” By the middle ages, stories about the two pyramids named them as the tombs of the legendary founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus. The actual tomb and inscriptions were not (re)discovered until tunnel builders found it in the 1600s. It was restored first in the 1600s, later in 1999, and again in 2015. It is the only pyramid of its kind in Europe. Today the tomb can only be accessed by special permission. For a view of the pyramid with less traffic, go inside the Aurelian walls to the Protestant Cemetery to the northwest side.  Near the Porta San Paolo at the Piramide subway station"
48,Devil's Hole,"St Mary, Jersey",This natural crater along the coast of Jersey may take its name from the devil statues who have watched over it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-devils-hole-st-mary-jersey,"There is a natural crater along the north coast of Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands between England and France. It wasn’t caused by a meteorite, but most likely by the collapse of a cave thousands of years ago. At the top there is a bronze namesake of a statue, to guide you down the trail to the Devil’s Hole. The Hole is about 100 feet in diameter, and 200 feet deep. The constant smashing of the waves makes it into a kind of blowhole, complete with eerie sucking sounds as the water is pulled down and out into the Channel. It was originally called Le Creux de Vis, or the Spiral Hollow, but sometime around 1850 or so the name was changed. How it got to be called the Devil’s Hole is the source of some speculation and debate. Some say it’s the strange sounds made by the waves, but the story most often told goes like this: It was about 1851 when a ship’s carved figurehead was found bobbing up and down inside Le Creux de Vis. The story isn’t exactly clear on where it came from—some say it was from a French shipwreck—or how it managed to hit a perfect bullseye and land in the crater. A local craftsman is said to have taken the figure home, fixed it up, added horns, and placed it back along the rim of the basin. From then on, it’s been called the Devil’s Hole. Being made of wood, such a figure couldn’t survive the harsh elements of the Jersey coast, so over the years, replacement devils have been swapped in. The current devil is weathered bronze, a somewhat spooky guide that stands in an algae-covered pool along the top of the trail. As part of the National Trust for Jersey’s protected lands, the area around the Devil’s Hole and the path to get there has been stabilized in recent years, and a viewing platform has been added for a birds-eye view. It’s surrounded by pasture with grazing sheep, so as you make your way down the path be careful to close any gates behind you. And leave the wooly creatures alone—the statue is scary enough without more little devils to watch out for.  Access to the Devil’s Hole is either from the trail head at the Priory Inn (use La Grande Rue or Le Chemin des Hougues to get to the Inn), or you can walk there along the cliff path. It's about a 10 or 15 minute hike to get down, and on the way to the hole you'll be heading downhill (some of the path is fairly steep). So keep in mind that it's an uphill climb to come back. There are benches along the way, some informational signage about the area, and a viewing platform above the Hole itself."
49,La Hougue Bie,Jersey,A passage grave used in neolithic rituals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-hougue-bie,"Although it has long since been appropriated by two Christian chapels, La Hougue Bie was at one time the site of a vastly different set of spiritual rituals, dating back to 3500 BCE. Hougue is derived from an Old Norse word meaning mound, and seems apt to describe the man-made hill rising from the earth. As with most Neolithic sites, the details surrounding its use are unclear. However, archeological work in the area has discovered that the site was likely used for ceremonies, and some ancient burials. Although it was not used primarily for burials, the site is one of the most well-preserved passage graves in the world. Passage graves were constructed out of giant stones forming a crawl space through a mound of earth. They are found extensively through Europe, but are not usually as well-preserved as La Hougue Bie. The passage grave is similarly fascinating in that it is oriented to receive the sun’s rays and illuminate the farthest recesses of the chamber on the two equinoxes. A few vases were also found in the passage, but without any more information to better understand how it was used and by whom, the 62-foot passage remains a great mystery. With the addition of the two chapels in the medieval period on top of the mound, the site walks visitors through the history of spirituality in Western Europe, and is a fantastic example of pagan sites co-opted by later Christianity. In the Chapel you can see the faded image of fresco paintings of angels over the alter, these were believed to have been painted in the 14th century, unfortunately they were over painted by the victorians in the 19th century.

50,Le Crapaud,"St Helier, Jersey",A statue erected in honor of the toadish nickname given to Jersey residents by the French.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/le-crapaud,"Both friends and bitter rivals since time immemorial, the French and the British have always engaged in a bit of name-calling. You’ll sometimes find the British referring to their continental neighbors as “frogs,” a derogatory term that partially stems from the stereotype that French people dine on frog legs. The French retaliated by calling the residents of Jersey (a United Kingdom territory that lies just off the Brittany coast, where French is used as much as English) “les crapauds,” meaning “toads.” Rather than croak about their nickname, the people of Jersey take a certain ironic pride in their “crapaud” status, to the extent that the warty toad has been adopted as a symbol for the island’s residents. So proud are the Jersey people of their moniker that the capital of Saint Helier has boasted a public sculpture of the hoary creature since 2004. The work of artist Gordon Young, the crapaud squats proudly atop his nine-foot column in an area previously known for its marshland toads. But the amicable amphibious association hasn’t always been friendly. According to an island legend, when Saint Samson of Dol arrived on Jersey, he found the people so unwelcoming that he sent all the toads and snakes from nearby Guernsey to their land. Jersey is the only island in the English Channel that has a population of native toads."
51,National Library of Kosovo,"Pristina, Kosovo","A futuristic, brutalist masterpiece that is also strangely prison-like.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kosovo-national-library,"Pristina’s public library is full of incongruities. The most obviously unusual element is the general appearance of this massive Kosovar structure. While so many libraries work to bring people inside, Pristina’s public library resembles a giant prison, hardly an appealing image to promote literacy. This building was completed in 1986. Covered in a lattice of fence-like metal, the building’s windows are obstructed, giving views from within the library a captive essence. Designed in the brutalist style, in many ways the library seems to look toward the future. Yet the white domes that top the many sections of the library were built to resemble men’s hats of the national outfit, putting the library in the middle of a conflict between tradition and modernity. Despite many people calling the building one of the ugliest in the nation, it is certainly a unique architectural effort, and captures the spirit of a country recently ravaged by war, and working to move forward and rebuild. Inside, there are more than 2 million library items, including rare materials such as books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps and photographs. There are two reading rooms, an amphitheater and a meeting hall. It has been used by Croatian and Bosnian refugees as living quarters and by the Serbian Army as a command center, during which many historical books were destroyed. The library is open to visitors, but guests should bring identification, like a passport."
52,Mitrovica Miners Monument,"Mitrovica, Kosovo",Two distorted Romanesque columns hold aloft a mine cart in honor of laborers who died during WWII.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mitrovica-miners-monument,"Standing in the form of some lost Roman addition to Stonehenge, Bogdan Bogdanović’s huge concrete monument in the town of Mitrovica is actually an homage to the community’s roots and to those who were lost during the fighting of World War II. Located atop a promontory known as Miner’s Hill, Bogdanović’s stark memorial speaks to the area’s rich history of, unsurprisingly, mining. The work is another in a long line of bleak concrete memorials that Bogdanović has created across Eastern Europe to remember those who died fighting German forces. The Mitrovica monument is comprised of two fluted columns that taper near the top to create a bit of forced perspective for those viewing the work from the ground. Perched atop the spires is the curved belly of a concrete mine cart replica that speaks directly to the history of the place. The monument was specifically dedicated to the Serbian and Albanian fighters from the area, many of whom worked as miners. As with many of the cement monuments that still litter Eastern Europe and Western Russia, the meaning behind the Mitrovica miner’s monument is lost both on many of the visitors and on many of the locals to whom it is simply becoming an aging stone curiosity much like the famous henge that inspired it."
53,Kosovo Bill Clinton Statue,"Pristina, Kosovo",A 11-foot former president stands on a Kosovo street that also bears his name.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kosovo-bill-clinton-statue,"Helped Kosovo achieve its independence? Then you get more than just a street sign to honor your contributions to the country. If you’re former President Bill Clinton, you’ll get your very own 11-foot brass statue. Regardless of one’s political leanings, it is hard to deny that President Clinton had a heavy hand in ending the war in Bosnia, and the Kosovo War during the 1990s. So seeing the city of Prishtina, capitol of Kosovo, name its main road Bill Clinton Boulevard after the American leader is no surprise. But the huge statue they built of him seemed to surprise the man himself. When Clinton traveled to Kosovo to unveil the big, brass monument in 2009, the Daily News quoted him as saying, “I never expected that anywhere, someone would make such a big statue of me.” Considering the tarnishing his legacy underwent in America due to his sex scandal, it must have seemed somewhat refreshing. The statue stands atop a blocky, three-tiered pedestal covered in white tile, in a small urban square. No matter how tall the statue is, the replica president still seems dwarfed by the monolithic, brutalist architecture towering around him. Nonetheless it is a reminder of an important revolution in the country and the allies that had a part in it."
54,Church of the Holy Emperor Uroš and Madhe Mosque,"Ferizaj, Kosovo","Christianity and Islam have clashed, yet here a Serbian Orthodox church and a mosque stand together.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-holy-emperor-uros-madhe-mosque,"The Balkans have seen their share of conflict and turmoil. There, for centuries, Orthodox Christians have been at odds with Muslims, and these religious identities have turned into national identities, as Serbians are predominantly Christian while Albanians, which are the majority of Kosovars, are Muslim. Yet in the small southern Kosovo municipality of Ferizaj (Albanian) or Urosevac (Serbian), one plot of land holds temples to both religions. A mosque, known as Madhe Mosque, was originally built in the 1890s, during the time of the Ottoman Empire, though is was destroyed by German bombers during World War II.  The current mosque was completedin 1943 and upgrades, including the second minaret, were completed as recently as 2013. In the late 1920s, it was decided that a Serbian Orthodox church was to be built in the same courtyard as the mosque. Later named the Church of the Holy Emperor Uroš, dedicated to Serbian emperor Uroš V. Over the years, strife and conflict took their toll on the church, including looting and fires after the beginning of the Kosovo War in 1999. Graffiti is commonly found on its walls to this day. Generally, though, the courtyard holding two seemingly conflicting ideologies goes on in peace."
55,Gadime Cave,"Gadime e Poshtme, Kosovo",The ceiling of this cavern is dripping with multicolored marble stalactites.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gadime-cave,"This cave was discovered by accident in 1966, when a farmer in the village of Gadime e Ulët was doing excavation while preparing to build a house. It was not until ten years later in 1976 that the remarkable limestone cavern was opened to visitors. The total length of all the known corridors and channels in Gadime Cave adds up to more than 4,000 feet, but the deeper part of the cave is still unexplored. It is estimated that it may extend for another 10,000 feet. Compared to cave systems like Mammoth Cave (the longest in the world, with more than 400 miles of tunnels) or Grotte di Frasassi (the longest in Europe, with more than 20 miles of tunnels), Gadime Cave is relatively small. But it is the longest cave system in Kosovo, and offers some extraordinary geological features. One remarkable feature of the cave is that most stalactites and stalagmites are made of marble, and they grow at an average of one millimeter every 30,000 years. Estimates place the formation of the cave in the tertiary geologic period (between 66 and 2.6 million years ago). Deep fissures in the rock can be seen in the ceiling and walls of the cave, and they are due to tectonic movements and erosion. Inside Gadime Cave you’ll find some large stalactites and stalagmites, but it is the smaller ones that form interesting, colorful patterns on the ceiling, floor, and walls of the cave. Some have been broken off, especially along the main corridors, but a large number are still intact, and they are cordoned off for protection. The main concrete corridors are quite handy considering that the cave is very wet, and the silt in the cave is both sticky and slippery. There are a few natural limestone basins where water collects, and an underground lake can be found inside the cave, but the corridors do not go that far. The temperature inside the cave is relatively stable all year round, wavering between 9.6 degrees Celsius and 16 degrees Celsius.  Gadima cave can be visited independently, or as part of a guided tour. There are currently two openings sufficiently large to be used as access points to the cave, but only one is used by visitors."
56,Newborn Monument,"Pristina, Kosovo",This massive monument was unveiled the day Kosovo declared independence from Serbia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/newborn-monument,"On February 17, 2008, the government of the Republic of Kosovo declared independence from Serbia and unveiled this monument. The original monument was bright yellow with blue banners to represent the European Union colors. “Newborn”, a single English word in a country dominated by the Albanian language, represents the birth of a new country, its positive connotations, and the potential for a modern, democratic Kosovo. At its unveiling, it was announced that the letters would be repainted annually to celebrate another year of freedom. People worked nonstop for 10 days to complete the monument so it could be unveiled on the day Kosovo formally declared independence. The 10-foot-tall, 79-foot-long monument is hard to miss, and it gained international attention as soon as it debuted. The tradition to annually repaint the monument is still going strong today. One year, the monument was repainted to represent the flags of all the countries that recognized Kosovo’s independence.  You can walk by the monument at any time."
57,Goddess on the Throne,"Pristina, Kosovo","This stone figurine was made more than 6,000 years ago and depicts a female deity of the Neolithic Vinča culture.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/goddess-on-the-throne,"The Goddess on the Throne is a terracotta statuette found in 1956 in Pristina (in modern-day Kosovo), and it is on display at Kosovo Museum. It measures 7.3 inches in height and is estimated to be 6,000 years old. The Goddess on the Throne is a fine example of Vinča art, and there is no doubt that it was inspired by one of the culture’s deities. Vinča culture developed in Southeastern Europe during the Neolithic era, which started with the beginning of agriculture and ended in about 2,300 B.C., when the use of bronze began to spread. One striking discovery made by archaeologists is that Vinča society was far more complex and advanced than it was initially postulated. One of the signs that points to this conclusion are the unearthing of identical figurines, indicating that they had been produced in a proto-industrial fashion unbecoming of Neolithic society. The Goddess on the Throne is an exceedingly well-preserved statuette. Similar, but less well-preserved figures are on display at Kosovo Museum. The Goddess on the Throne and these other figurines do not exhibit obvious or exaggerated female physical traits as other statuettes of that period. In their place, what stands out are the odd-shaped heads. Angular and vaguely anthropomorphic, these heads may call to mind stereotypical depictions of extra-terrestrials. Additionally, the unexpected level of complexity and advancement of the Vinča society has convinced some that such a massive leap forward in human progress could only be explained by the intervention of a benevolent extra-terrestrial entity. The Goddess on the Throne has become the symbol of Pristina, and a stylized representation of the Goddess on the Throne has been adopted as the logo of the Kosovo Museum."
58,Narcis Hotel,"Štrpce, Kosovo","As of 2022, the 124 rooms of Kosovo ski resort remain empty.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/narcis-hotel,"Running along the Kosovo/North Macedonia border, the Šar Mountains offer the best opportunities for skiing in Kosovo. The Brezovica ski resort has been the most prominent center for winter sports in this area since 1954, but infrastructures supporting winter tourism have been neglected over the past 20 years—some would claim for much longer. A glimmer of hope that the area may undergo re-development work surfaced in 2014, but it quickly evaporated due to lack of funds. The high expectations undergirding the establishment of the Brezovica ski resort and the uncertainty around its future are two vastly divergent sets of ideas that intersect in the empty corridors of abandoned hotels in and around Brezovica. Narcis Hotel is by far the most conspicuous example of this state of affairs. With its imposing center block and two sloping wings evoking ski runs, Narcis Hotel is still the unmissable landmark that it was in 1973, when it first opened its doors to Yugoslavian skiers. However, unlike the polished image that Narcis Hotel once had, nowadays its exterior is neglected, and its iconic sign is in ruin. No one but the guards are to be seen on site, which explains why all the doors and windows are intact, and the hotel has not been broken in. If the situation for many a hotel in the area is grim, Narcis Hotel faces an additional difficulty, namely being located in the village of Strpce. In fact, the majority of inhabitants in Strpce are of Serbian origins, while the remaining population is made up of Kosovars. This resulted in businesses in the hands of ethnic Serbs being boycotted by tourists of Kosovar ethnicity. Following Kosovo’s declaration of independence in 2008 the situation worsened, and Narcis Hotel’s rate of occupancy fell to 5 percent. This was an untenable situation, and the managers had to make the drastic but inevitable decision to close down. Future prospects are equally bleak, as the ethnic makeup of the village makes the location highly volatile and unlikely to attract investors."
59,Memorial Complex Adem Jashari,"Prekaz, Kosovo",The site where the leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army was killed is now a memorial.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/memorial-complex-adem-jashari,"History books of the Balkans are peppered with accounts of conflict between the Albanian and the Serbian ethnicities. Unsurprisingly, words such as occupation or liberation are deployed regularly to describe the same events, depending on who is narrating. One such event is the recent Kosovo War, which started in February 1998 and ended in June 1999. The two main entities involved in the conflict were the forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the Serbian side, and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) on the Albanian side, with the latter trying to undermine the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia’s hold on Kosovo. Adem Jashari was one of the key founders of KLA. Jashari was born in 1955 in the village of Prekaz, which belongs to a region inhabited predominantly by ethnic Albanians while the territory was within the borders of Yugoslavia. In 1991, Jashari participated in an uprising against the Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo, and KLA was founded. Shortly after this, Jashari moved to Albania for military training. Upon his return to his hometown, he resumed his activities against the Yugoslav authorities, which eventually led to the Yugoslav forces surrounding his compound on March 5, 1998. More than 60 people were inside the compound, and they included many women and children. By the end of the battle, 28 militants and 30 civilians were killed. Among the militants was Adem Jashari, and most of the civilians that were killed were members of Jashari’s family. This was a turning point that marked the beginning of the Kosovo War.  An unintended consequence of the massacre of Prekaz was KLA’s immediate rise in popularity and respect among the Albanian communities and beyond. Most of the international community turned against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and eventually NATO got involved in the conflict. The Memorial Complex Adem Jashari consists of a garden, a museum, and two buildings. The garden is where the graves of the soldiers that died in the conflict can be found, constantly guarded by soldiers of the Kosovo Security Force (KSF).  The museum displays everyday objects that belonged to those who died during the clash on March 5, 1998, including the AK47 that Adem Jashari used on that fateful day. The two buildings belong to the compound where the fighting took place, and they are riddled with bullet holes and bigger cracks caused by heavy artillery.  These two buildings are surrounded by scaffolding so that visitors can appreciate the level of destruction caused by the battle without actually touching the buildings. Several other buildings in Prekaz village and the surrounding countryside bear the scars of this battle."
60,Ura e Terzive,"Bishtazhin, Kosovo",This 15th-century Ottoman bridge was modified to keep up with the changing course of the river Erenik.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ura-e-terzive,"Ura e Terzive is an Ottoman stone bridge originally built in the 15th century in the proximity of the village of Bishtazhin, on the merchant route linking Turkey to Albania. It averages 3.5 meters in width, making it a one-lane bridge, even though nowadays it is rarely used, and only by pedestrians. Its 11 arches and 10 niches extend for over 190 meters, some of which span the river Erenik. In fact, the length of the bridge vastly exceeds that of the river.  This is due to changes in the course of the river Erenik through time, and the building of additional arches as a result. The current structure of the bridge came about from modifications made during the 18th century, while its polished appearance is due to restoration work carried out between 1982 and 1984. Apart from its historical importance, one interesting thing about Ura e Terzive is the inscriptions and drawings carved into its stones. Among the drawings are two pots or jars, and the Star of David. A Turkish inscription on the bridge testifies that the construction of the original bridge was commissioned by the Tailors’ Guild. This is why Ura e Terzive is locally referred to as the Tailors’ Bridge. By facilitating travels between the cities of Gjakova and Prizren, Ura e Terzive boosted local commerce and acquired utmost strategic importance. Nowadays, a new road connecting the two cities is located a few meters north of the bridge, making it, for all intents and purposes, a monument rather than a functional bridge."
61,The Corner House,"Riga, Latvia",A former Latvian headquarters of the brutal KGB secret police is now open as a grim reminder of their atrocities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-corner-house-riga-latvia,"The lovely Art Nouveau building in center of the Latvian capital of Riga is actually a former KGB headquarters known as The Corner House, where political prisoners would be taken and subject to torture and worse. The city of Riga came under Soviet control in 1940, and the brutal new leaders brought with them the dreaded KGB secret police. Setting up shop in the Corner House, a secretive headquarters in the middle of the city, the KGB began summoning people to uncertain fates within the depths of the building. “Undesirable Elements” could be picked up for crimes as small as having “anti-Soviet conversations” or “instigating panic.” Many of the people captured by the KGB were executed in a killing area in the basement of the Corner House. Still others were crammed into cells with dozens of other prisoners, and made to sweat and go mad with thirst as the basement was kept at around 85 degrees. When the Nazis drove the Soviets out of Riga during World War II, they opened the doors of the secretive house to garner trust from the population by showing them the horrors the Soviets had created. After the war, the Germans left the country and the Soviets came right back, continuing the secret police practices as they had before. Latvia finally regained its independence in 1991, and the Corner House was simply closed off so that the country could move on. In 2012 some of the space was reopened as a museum and visitors can now see first hand, the secretive headquarters of the brutal KGB. Most of the official documents are still kept hidden away, but just being able to see the location itself is a haunting reminder of a dark period in the city’s history."
62,Riga Central Market,"Riga, Latvia","3,000 market stands in five former Zeppelin hangars.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zeppelin-hangers-turned-markets,"At the turn of the 20th century, Zeppelins were seen as the transportation of the future. During that time, five giant hangars were created to house the German-made airships in the center of Riga, Latvia. When Zeppelins fell out of use, a move to convert the hangars was proposed, and the hangars were turned into Europe’s largest market bazaar. Built in stunning Neoclassical and Art Deco style, the market spans an area of 778,000 square feet and houses 3,000 trade stands. Farmers and craftsman set up hundreds of tables there hawking their wares, only slowed by the Nazi and Soviet occupations that came during the next 60 years. During the Nazi occupation, the market was almost completely shut down to house troops and supplies for the army. However, the market was re-invigorated under the Soviets, who took credit for the Riga Central Market, claiming it was a stunning example of a successful market in the Soviet Union."
63,Art Nouveau in Riga,"Riga, Latvia",Flamboyant architecture from the turn of 20th century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/art-nouveau-riga,"Art Nouveau or Jugendstil (as it was known in German influenced countries) was a style in decorative arts which marked the turn of 20th century. It originated in France but quickly spread throughout Europe often merging with local artistic tendencies. It left a trail of iconic examples of design, from Paris metro stations and works of Victor Horta in Brussels to Helsinki main railway station and secessionist buildings in Budapest. Latvian capital boasts one the most extensive assortment of pure Art Nouveau buildings in Europe. There are over 800 Art Nouveau buildings scattered all over Riga’s historic center. The most striking examples can be found along Elizabetes Iela and Alberta. These include buildings by Mikhail Eisenstein the father of the famous director Sergei Eisenstein.

64,The Three Brothers,"Riga, Latvia",The oldest housing complex in Riga is a mini timeline of architectural trends.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-three-brothers-riga-latvia,"According to local lore, the bond that binds these adjacent buildings, dubbed the “three brothers,” goes deeper than just their names and location. Supposedly, they were all built by descendants of the same family. Whether or not that is true, the “brothers” stand next to one another as a striking timeline of architectural trends. The first brother, which was built in the late 15th century, is among the oldest dwellings in all of Riga. The building features impressive Gothic and Dutch influences, all crowned by an intricate set of crow-stepped gables. It was originally used as one large room; a bustling little hub for manufacturing, trade, and everyday life. The middle brother is a pleasant shade of mellow yellow, though its pale color doesn’t mean it’s a structure to be overlooked. This building, arguably the architecturally grandest and most eye-catching one, was built in the mid-17th century. It, too, features Dutch influences thanks to the city’s trade relationship with the Netherlands. The house boasts intricate details including an engraving above the door that reads, “Soli Deo gloria!” (“Glory to God alone!” in Latin). The youngest brother came along shortly after the middle one. It was built in the later half of the 17th century and is the thinnest of the trio. Its green facade is allegedly meant to be a mask to protect the property from evil spirits. Amazingly, pedestrians are invited to step inside the historic dwelling, as it happens to house the Latvian Museum of Architecture. The museum gives visitors an inside look (literally) at the gorgeous house, as well as a peek at the blueprints and drafts of other architectural marvels throughout the city."
65,Bridge to Nowhere,"Irlavas pagasts, Latvia",A railway bridge leading nowhere stands lonely in the middle of a meadow.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bridge-to-nowhere-latvia,"In the middle of the Latvian countryside is an unusual structure bound to pique the curiosity of anyone who happens upon it. The “Tilts uz nekurieni,” or “Bridge to Nowhere,” is a narrow-gauge railway bridge leading nowhere at all, surrounded on both ends by nothing but a lush green meadow. The concrete span across the Abava River, just 180 feet long (55 meters), was built in 1940, intended to be part of the new Tukums-Kuldiga rail line that was under construction. It was one of a number of ambitious projects planned by the newly independent and quickly developing republic of Latvia. Then World War II broke out. With the nation at war, the railway line was never finished. The high costs of civil engineering and construction are a major consideration in building any railroad. As these activities require specialized equipment and personnel, it is not uncommon to have these portions of a project completed ahead of the general track laying. The abandoned bridge still stands intact, a strange sight in the Irlavas village, near Sāti. To many locals, the lonely Bridge to Nowhere also represents a wartime memorial of sorts. It commemorates the failed effort made by the Germans to continue the bridge during the Nazi occupation of Latvia in the early 1940s. The unique structure may serve no practical purpose, but it belongs to Latvia alone."
66,Black Cat of Riga,"Riga, Latvia",A black cat protests the City Guild in Riga's Old Town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/black-cat-on-roof,"Getting into the Great Guild in Latvia in the 14th century, was an incredibly huge honor. Similarly, getting snubbed from the Great Guild was a gigantic insult. One Riga local was so offended that he attached a black cat on top of his building so it would cast its evil glare upon the Guild for as long as the building would stand. With an arched back, the Black Cat of Riga seems ready to strike and clearly states the man’s displeasure at not getting admitted to the Guild. Obviously, the members of the guild hated the sculpture, and a fight between the man and the guild raged for months to come. Although an agreement was reached and the statue turned around, the Black Cat still sits on its perch in Old Town Riga.  Riga's Old Town, Meistaru street 10/12"
67,Liepaja Northern Forts,"Liepāja, Latvia",These crumbling Latvian forts make for some haunting seaside ruins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/liepaja-northern-forts,"Crumbling away on the edge of the Latvian coast, a row of abandoned concrete bunkers have formed a lovely line of ruins that harken back to a fort built by Tzarist Russia. When they were created, the ruins encircled the entire city of Liepaja. The Northern Forts were part of Liepaja’s central fortress and they were built between the 19th and 20th century to provide shelter to the naval base. A line of outer fortifications surrounded the whole city. However, in 1908, after less than ten years of construction, the whole fortress was considered a strategic misstep and it was abandoned. There were attempts to blow up parts of it, but destroying such robust fortifications is no easy feat, and the remains still stand today. Surprisingly, the efforts to destroy the forts had the effect of creating haunting seaside ruins. Each little stone bunker holds its own secrets. Achieving what man’s powerful explosives could not, the sea has started to take its toll and part of the Northern Forts complex has collapsed to the waterline. This has made it a popular place for youngsters to climb in and around these broken bunkers. The bunkers run along the coast and can be accessed via Krasta street, Koknese street or Jatnieku street."
68,Ligatne Secret Soviet Bunker,"Ligatne, Latvia",A top secret Cold War bunker hidden beneath a Latvian spa facility is now open for tours.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ligatne-secret-soviet-bunker,"Deep beneath Latvia’s “Ligatne” rehabilitation centre, a sort of spa centre, is a well-equipped facility that was built to protect the Soviet political elite in case of a less-relaxing nuclear attack. Planning for the hidden stronghold actually began in the late 1960s, but the Soviet facility was not completed until 1982. A sanatorium was built as though nothing was unusual about it, but unbeknownst even to the workers at the rehabilitation center, the site held a number of secrets. Buried 30 feet beneath the building above, the bunker was a powerful, autonomous, self-sustaining structure filled with state-of-the-art-of-the-day equipment and supplies. The 213,000 square foot hideout could support 250 people for up to three months in the case of a nuclear attack, and was protected beneath layers of dirt, cement, and metal plate. The plan was for the Soviet leadership in Latvia to retreat to the bunker should anyone drop the bomb. The bunker wasn’t the only secret on the grounds either. A shallow reflecting pool in front of the spa building was actually a hidden helipad, and another was camouflaged as a basketball court. The Soviets called the secret redoubt, Pansionat, The Pention House. Since it was a military defense structure, the bunker reverted to the Latvian Ministry of Defense after the Soviet regime ended. When Latvia joined NATO, the secret defense did not measure up to NATO s standards and the site was taken out of military control. Thanks to this abandonment by the military, the bunker was left in its original condition, with all of the old equipment and decoration that it originally had. The former secret facility was opened to the public in 2003, and can now enter the strange Stalinist halls that look like they have not only been protected from radiation, but time as well. The bunker is up in the forested area of Skalupes."

Down to every last detail, the ghost town movie set spared no expense. Three bridges cross a man-made river, which also features a steamship replica, harkening back to turn-of-the century Riga. When movies are not being filmed on the cobbled streets of Cinevilla, visitors are invited to wander the town and even spend the night.

70,Castle of Light,"Riga, Latvia",Latvia's symbolic mountain-shaped national library is home to millions of cultural tomes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castle-of-light,"In Latvian literature and folklore, a “castle of light” is a metaphor for lost wisdom that can be reclaimed after the people overcome the symbolic darkness of war, invasion, and occupation. It comes from an old legend in which a mystical castle symbolizing culture and knowledge sinks in a lake but will one day be rebuilt. It’s thus a fitting name for the striking modern structure that now houses the cultural archives of the former Soviet-occupied nation. The Castle of Light, as the National Library of Latvia (Latvijas Nacionālā bilbiotēka) is locally known, was opened in 2014 on the banks of the Daugava River. The building, designed by Latvian-American architect Gunnar Birkerts, is shaped like a large mountain with a glass flame atop the structure. The glass flame makes up the 11th and 12th floors and offers a magnificent panorama of Old Town Riga on the river. The library includes an open space in the center of the building that allows visitors to look up at floors of books, manuscripts, sheet music, and other cultural treasures. The space claims to house more than 1,000 places to read, and shelf space for more than six million items. There is also an auditorium, gift shop, and excellent cafe. A permanent exhibition takes a look at both the history of books in Latvia and how these works have shaped and influenced the Latvian culture. The major collections focus on items in Latvian or about the country and its people, including children’s literature, science, technology, music, and cartography.  Information on visiting is available on the library website, but as of July 2018 visitors can explore portions of the library daily, although levels 11 and 12 are only open on Saturdays. Stop at the welcome desk to register for the visit. Tours are also available and can be set up through the library for a small per person fee."
71,Pokaini Forest,"Naudītes Pagasts, Latvia",Mysterious heaps of stones dot these otherworldly woods.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pokaini-forest,"Strange clusters of stones freckle this Latvian forest. People have been drawn into these woods for ages, lured by the mysterious rocks and their alleged powers. But unusual rock heaps remain unexplained. One proposed reason for their existence is that the stones may have been gathered centuries ago to build a castle that never materialized. This, however, would be hard to prove, as there are no records of such activities in the area. A more mundane explanation is that people gathered them while clearing the fields for farming. But this still wouldn’t explain why they plunked them in various piles so deep in the forest. People have attributed special powers to the stones. Some consider the forest to be a healing center or an old pagan sanctuary, and it’s now frequented by psychics and channelers to boost their energetic charges. Some visitors claim the stones have an uplifting and energizing effect. People will sometimes bring offerings to enhance the stones’ powers. Others treat this place with caution and consider it to be a haunted area, or even a gateway to a parallel world. There are rumors that some people have died or otherwise suffered soon after visiting the forest. It’s said that taking the stones from the woods and bringing them home is dangerous.  You need your own transportation to visit the place. The area is large with different footpaths in many locations. You can get a map from the visitor's center, drive to the forest, make stops on the parking areas and hike along the footpaths from there. If you plan to visit all the locations and footpaths, plan to be there for around four or five hours."

However, if you’re picturing something along the lines of Niagara Falls or Iguazu Falls you will be very surprised. The height of this Latvian waterfall is only about 6 feet (less than 2 meters). Thanks to its relatively squat height, the Venta Rapid (Ventas rumba in Latvian) is much less well-known than Europe’s famous drops. But it is no less a natural wonder. Visitors can enjoy walking along the width of the waterfall and even bathing in it. In spring and autumn, when spawning fish migrate upstream, you can watch from the banks as flying fish try to jump over the rapid. Around 300 years ago, the Duke of Courland invented a technique to catch up to 100 salmon a day using baskets placed all along the waterfall. The neighbouring town, Kuldiga, grew in size as fishermen were drawn to the site. Today, Kuldiga is a beautiful town worth wandering around to admire its views of the waterfall and its quaint buildings. And it’s able to boast that it’s the only place in Europe where fish are caught right in the air. An impressive brick bridge, built in 1874, runs parallel to the waterfall and is an excellent place to admire the site. You may get more than you bargained for if you go in summer though: the Race of the Naked is an annual tradition that takes place on midsummer nights."

In the summer, when the grass grows tallest, they’re difficult to spot. The Mazirbe boat cemetery is located in a forest near the seaside of Mazirbe, Dundaga County. Years ago, many of these boat cemeteries were built across the coast of the Baltic Sea. But nowadays, this graveyard is the only one of its kind in the area. The boats have been here since the 1960s and ’70s, when the discarded vessels were abandoned in the woods. Sadly, their time here appears to be running short, as the wooded graveyard is expected to be lost in about 10 years as nature continues reclaiming the site. Visiting the boat cemetery makes for an interesting walk along the seaside, complete with a touch of history. On a trail, you’ll spot wooden poles with barbed wire. These are markers of a time when the area was closed and civilian movement was restricted.  You can visit the boats free of charge."

In its day the sweeping complex was well guarded and isolated from rest of the city, creating a kind of city inside a city: Occupying 2 square miles, the fortress includes 10 streets and some 80 buildings. Daugavpils is located near the border of Lithuania, Belarus and Russia, and the majority of the city’s population speaks Russian. The mighty fortress was originally a Russian military outpost. Plans for the fortress were first laid out in 1772 by Russian Tsar Alexander I, and construction started in 1810 in anticipation of Napoleon’s attack on the Russian Empire.  Two years later the fortress successfully repelled Napoleon’s army. Although the official count states that more than 1,000 people could live inside the premises, most of the complex is now abandoned and looks like a ghost town. The complex is closed off, but you can find your way and sneak in to many of the abandoned houses, barracks and old hospital. You can also observe and walk on the old bastions, moats and ramparts, and a former Soviet military academy on the premises. Today all these places are perfect for urban exploring. The status of the whole complex might change in the nearby future as some of the buildings have already been restored and given a new function (Mark Rothko Art Center is now located in one of the buildings). Still, according to locals the city government has no particular plan of what to do with this piece of history and most of the buildings are still awaiting their fate."

Known as the Hill of Witches, this public trail through the woods takes visitors on a trip through the most well-known legends and stories in Lithuanian folk history. Work began in 1979 on the sculpture park, and it now features 80 different wooden carvings from local artists. Painstakingly hand-crafted, each sculpture depicts a popular character from folk and pagan traditions in the Juodkrante. The public park got its name long before the sculptures were placed along the wooded trails, and is in fact a reference to the pagan celebrations that take place on the hill during the Midsummer’s Eve Festival. Each year on June 24, people across Lithuania dance, sing, and bring in the midsummer with the older folk traditions of the country. After Christianity came to Lithuania, the celebration was renamed Saint Jonas’ Festival, but many of the practices still have pagan roots, as is echoed by the fantastic world of the Hill of Witches sculptures.

78,Hill of Crosses,"Meškuičių seniūnija, Lithuania","An old hill fort covered in over 100,000 crosses is a symbol of Lithuanian nationalism and beliefs.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hill-of-crosses,"Located 7.5 miles north of the town of Siauliai, in northern Lithuania, the Hill of Crosses occupies a low rise of ground once thought to have been a Domantai, or hill fort. The nearby city was founded in 1236 and occupied by Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire during the 14th century. Crosses are thought to have first appeared on the site during this time as a way of expressing the desire for Lithuanian independence. Crosses continued to be placed on the site throughout the medieval period by local Catholics. During a peasant uprising against Russian control of the area in 1831, the practice of placing crosses in remembrance of missing and dead rebels began. By 1895, it is recorded that there were 150 large crosses on the site, and this number grew to 400 by 1940. During Soviet occupation of the area that lasted from 1944 to 1991, the Hill of Crosses became a symbol of defiance. Three times during the Soviet occupation, the hill and its crosses were bulldozed. Despite these attempts to end the symbolism of the site, both locals and pilgrims once again begin erecting crosses. It’s estimated that there are more than 100,000 crosses on the hill as of 2007. Thousands visit the site each year, with the most famous visit occurring in 1993 when Pope John Paul II came to dedicate the site. A stone marker bearing his words, “Thank you, Lithuanians, for this hill of crosses which testifies to the nations of Europe and to the whole world the faith of the people of this land” now lies at the foot of the hill. A hermitage has been erected nearby to assist visitors and the faithful are welcome to add their contribution.  The hill is 7.5 miles north of the city of Šiauliai, in northern Lithuania. From the Šiauliai main bus station, you can take a bus for 10 minutes and then walk 10 more minutes to get to the Hill."
79,Vilnil Museum of Illusions,"Vilnius, Lithuania",Things aren't quite what they seem at this mind-bending museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vilnil-museum-of-illusions,"Sometimes, you can’t believe your eyes. At least not at the Vilnil Museum of Illusions in Vilnius. This entire museum, full of pieces and rooms that bend reality a bit, is devoted to mind-tricking works of art. Opened in 2016, the interactive museum will have you questioning what you’re seeing. It features nearly 70 exhibits demonstrating optical illusions, 3-D art, virtual reality, and installations that challenge the senses. Here, images bend and shift, people seem to have the ability to walk on walls, and stories are told in light. The museum’s 3-D paintings and the perspective illusions were created by local artists. Four times a week, the museum also features dance performances from Liepsnose Studios. Their performances combine dance and technology in an LED light show about the history of Vilnius. If you want to know more about the illusions, just ask for a tour, where a guide will explain the science behind the exhibits. Above all, the idea behind the museum is to have fun. Pictures are allowed and encouraged— the staff might even help you get that perfect shot."

Founded in 1991 by then-23-year-old Lithuanian sculptor Gintaras Karosas, the park stretches for 55 hectares, covered in pieces of modern art of all shapes and sizes. Scattered and strewn across the park are over 90 works hailing from 27 countries. Some of the most well-known are LNK Infotree, which includes 3,000 television sets, and Monument of the Centre of Europe, which is a series of plaques that indicate the distances of a number of European capital cities from the park, both by Karosas himself. You can rent bikes on the grounds, or simply meander around the sculptures, made of materials ranging from wood to stone to metal to other materials. There are several natural springs, and in springtime, the park comes alive with flower blossoms. In the middle of the park you can visit Liubavas, one of the oldest estates in Lithuania, which was converted into a museum of history and culture in 2011. Part of the museum is dedicated to watermills, an important piece of technology in the region’s industrial history and heritage. The Liubavas Manor has the only mill in the entire country with completely restored equipment; it can demonstrate the processing of grain, wood, and metal as well as power generation. There’s even a functioning 100-year-old water turbine.  You can take the 66 bus from Vilnius (from Žalgirio bus stop in the direction of Skirgiškės) or hire your own transport. The drive is about 15-20 minutes. There is an entrance fee."
81,Juodasis Vaiduoklis (The Black Ghost),"Klaipėda, Lithuania",A creepy statue of a hooded ghost hauls itself up from the water in a historic Lithuanian city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-black-ghost,"Klaipėda (formerly Memel) is a historic and relatively tranquil port city on Lithuania’s Baltic coast. Since it was first mentioned in historic records in 1252, it has variously been governed by the Teutonic Knights, the Kingdom of Prussia, the German Empire, and the Soviet Red Army. Thanks to its historic role as one of the foremost ice-free ports in the Eastern Baltic, Klaipėda has long been an important maritime location, with large shipyards and fishing ports. In more recent years, cruise ships have been coming to Klaipėda, their passengers coming ashore to enjoy the nearby white sand beaches and the city’s numerous theaters, museums, historic sites, and traditional breweries. Arguably the most incongruous sight in the city’s old town, at least for newly arrived tourists, is located along the peaceful waterfront. Here, a hooded, wraithlike figure, not dissimilar to the Nazgûl from The Lord of the Rings, clambers up from the water, holding aloft a lantern in its gnarled hand. The bronze sculpture, known as “Juodasis Vaiduoklis” (“The Black Ghost”) has been terrifying children since 2010. Sculpted by Svajunas Jurkus and Sergejus Plotnikovas, the figure is 7.8 feet in height, with about half below the level of the waterfront walkway and half above. Apart from the ghost’s hands, the hooded robe is empty inside, creating a strangely expressive spectral appearance despite the lack of any facial features. For many new arrivals, the main question regarding this creepy sculpture is: Why? Well, it’s all tied to a local legend that isn’t quite as terrifying as you would imagine. The legend dates back to 1595, when Hans von Heidi, one of the guards at Klaipėda Castle, was doing his nightly rounds near the harbor. From out of nowhere, a hooded figure appeared near the water’s edge. Rather than attack the startled guard, it asked him how the city’s supplies of grain and timber were holding out. Von Heidi informed the ghost that the city had sufficient supplies, but the ghost warned him it would not be enough. At that point, the apparition vanished. Back in the good old days, of course, people were inclined to believe the words of ghosts, witches, goblins, and giants. And so Hans von Heidi dutifully informed his superiors of his ghostly encounter, and the city set about increasing its supplies of timber and grain. Then followed a bleak few years of hunger and shortage, which the people of Klaipėda only survived because of the ghost’s warning. So rather than being a twisted tribute to some nefarious Nazgûl-like wraith, the sculpture of the Black Ghost pays tribute to Klaipėda’s spectral savior: a Casper of sorts, just far more frightening.  The Black Ghost sculpture is located near the ruins of Klaipėda Castle along the castle marina, just past the swing bridge and near the Old Mill Hotel. Klaipėda is located in western Lithuania along the Baltic Sea coast. At night the sculpture is illuminated internally with a green glow, making it a little more creepy than normal."
82,The Dead Dunes,"Neringos savivaldybė, Lithuania",A narrow strip of land is home to the tallest migrating dunes in Europe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-dead-dunes-neringos-savivaldybe-lithuania,"Built by winds and sea currents, the Curonian Spit is a ribbon of sand separating the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea. The barrier bar has been designated a national park by both Lithuania and Russia. As a protected area within a protected area, the Dead Dunes are one of the most dramatic and botanically significant features of this unique geological formation. Ranging up to 60 meters in height, the Dead Dunes still obscure four villages and two cemeteries that were swallowed by the shifting sands between 1675 and 1854, when the dunes were travelling 0.5 to 15 meters per year. Human activity on the Curonian Spit—also known as Neringa—dates back to at least the 9th century CE, and was subsequently occupied by the Teutonic Knights, whose presence led to increased grazing and logging. The resulting deforestation created a more transient landscape of sand dunes that warped and migrated with the prevailing westerly winds. Reforestation efforts began in the 19th century, and were largely successful. The Dead Dunes provide a glimpse of an unreconstructed stretch of Neringa. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the “Dead Dunes” moniker is a striking misnomer; the area comprises the Nagliai Nature Reserve, an ecologically sensitive region home to multiple rare and fragile plants. The unique flora overall provide a muted, earth-toned appearance, making the alternate name of the “Grey Dunes” make a bit more sense. Visitors to the Nagliai Nature Reserve are obliged to stay on the marked trail, in order to avoid disrupting the peculiar and delicate ecosystem."
83,Monument to the Victims of Fascism,"Kaunas, Lithuania",A memorial to the murdered Jews of Kaunas.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-to-the-victims-of-fascism-kaunas,"Fort IX in Kaunas has played host to two occupying powers. Tsarist Russia constructed the fort as a stronghold used to defend Russia’s border in the West, and the Soviet Union used the fort as a way station to the Gulag. However, the Soviets held the fort for only one year, until the Nazis invaded Lithuania in 1941, sending Soviet troops scattering back to the border. At the turn of the century, Kaunas had a flowering Jewish community. 1/3 of the 75,000 people in the town were Jews and the town was considered a cultural and learning capitol of the Jewish world. Prior to World War II, the Lithuanian Jewish population totaled 220,000, a very significant portion of the population. Unfortunately, the Nazi occupation of Fort IX brought tragedy to the community. A ghetto was set up in Kaunas, eventually holding 40,000 Jews. During the entire course of the war, only 500 Jews escaped, many joining the army to fight the Nazis in Southern Lithuania. Immediately after its occupation, the fort was used for mass killings of Lithuanian and German Jews. In 1941, the first mass killing of German Jews took place in the forest behind the fort. The atrocities continued through the war, and between 35,000-50,000 Jews were murdered at Fort IX in Kaunas. Many were placed in unmarked graves they were forced to dig themselves. 2,000 Jews also perished in the Kaunas ghetto when the Nazis destroyed it with explosives in 1944 as they were losing ground. In 1958, a small memorial was placed in the field behind Fort IX to memorialize the horrifying loss of Jewish life in Lithuania and Kaunas. Sadly, it took another 33 years before the current monument was erected. In 1991, the remaining Jewish community of Kaunas unveiled three massive steles designed by Alfonsas Ambraziūnas. The current Jewish population of the entire country of Lithuania stands at 3,200. Accessible from Kaunas city center"
84,Orvidas Garden,"Salantai, Lithuania",Sculpture garden of religious statues made it through Soviet rule.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/orvydas-garden,"Although the Soviet Union softened after Stalin’s death, life under Khrushchev still wasn’t easy for artists and religious people, especially in the satellite states. Being both an artist, and a devout Christian, Vilius Orvidas felt constantly harassed by the Soviet system. Yet from his repression, he created a beautiful and innovative rebellion in the form of an open-air sculpture garden on his family’s land in Lithuania. On the outskirts of the small town of Salantai, his garden has become a sort-of folk legend to locals. Although Orvidas was a self-trained sculptor, the idea for his garden came from his father, Kazimieras who had saved and collected a vast number of religious sculptures that would have otherwise been destroyed by the Soviet government. With these beginnings, Orvidas added to the works, landscaping his family’s plot into a immense world of art on the fringe of being banned. Along with classic religious sculptures made out of wood and stone, Orvidas also included massive boulders, carved tree-trunks resembling Lithuanian folktale characters and replica Soviet tanks in his garden. While his work was not done in direct opposition to Soviet rule but more out of a curious sense of art and religion, many flocked to the gardens and considered him a great rebel against the oppressive regime. He died in 1992 at the age of 40, but his garden is still maintained by his relatives. The garden is open and available to the public for visiting and wandering the majestic grounds.  Four buses run daily between Plunge, Salantai and SkuodasThe park itself is little bit outside Salantai in Gargždele"

Do you have a soul? Do you have a desire to keep said soul? If not, stop on by the Žmuidzinavičius Museum, where over 3,000 interpretations of the Devil can make your wildest dreams come true. What began as a small collection in the private home of Lithuanian artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius, has blossomed into a multi-structure gathering of lords of the underworld. Today, the museum houses over 3,000 works depicting the devil. The majority of the pieces are sculptures, made from a variety of mediums including wood, glass, ceramic and paper. Since 1982, when the museum first expanded, there has been a flood of devils into Lithuania from around the world including masks, witches and other mythological characters. One of the stranger pieces featured in the museum is a sculpture of Hitler and Stalin skipping around an area littered with human bones. Although the collection began with a focus on fine art depictions of Satan, it has moved into the realm of souvenir as well, and many items now housed in the Devils’ Museum were left as gifts by visitors.

In fact, the museum, which opened in 2005, is dark and housed in the catacombs of St. Michael the Archangel Church. While the museum was originally intended for the blind, it has morphed into a place where the sighted can experience an hour in a blind person’s shoes. Its exhibits indulge the aural, olfactory, and tactile senses, providing the sighted with the experience of blindness. Sculptor Robertas Antinis spearheaded the project of converting the church’s catacombs into a museum. Students from the Kaunas Institute of Technology worked on the project as part their “Catacombs of the 21st Century” project. Signs in the museum feature Braille and Lithuanian alike. Visitors experience strange textures, soundscapes, aromas, and other sensory objects. Some of the textures, sounds, and smells act as navigational cues as visitors roam through the catacombs."

The 500-year-old church remains a prime example of Gothic architecture so beautiful, it’s said Napoleon Bonaparte fell in love with the cathedral. The Church of St. Anne was built for Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania, and wife to Vytautas the Great. The church was burned down in 1419 and then rebuilt in brick on the orders of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander I Jagiellon. Consecrated back in 1500, the facade seen today is largely unchanged since its reconstruction in the 1400s. It is unclear exactly who is the genius architect behind St. Anne, although theories point to Michael Enkinger—an architect of a church of the same name in Warsaw— or Benedikt Rejt. What is clear is that St. Anne is a stunning example of Gothic architecture, using dramatic archways, a symmetrical facade, and ornate pillars. According to legend, the church is so captivating that Napoleon Bonaparte—who spotted the church during the Franco-Russian War in 1812—wished to carry the church home with him to Paris “in the palm of his hand.”  Check the official website for visiting hours and information, prior to your travels."

The railroad has been saving pedestrians from a 466-foot uphill trek since 1931. Today, it sends weary-legged tourists zipping along the hill between the Vytautas the Great War Museum and the Basilica of the Resurrection. When it was first built, the funicular only had one active car. The other was filled with heavy stones and served as a platform to balance its mobile counterpart. The bottom end of the railway didn’t even have a shelter until a year after it opened. Thankfully, interest in the funicular boomed and it was expanded and improved a few years later. The original cars were replaced with larger models and the bottom station finally received an actual shelter so passengers no longer had to wait while exposed to the elements. Now, the funicular serves as both a mode of transportation and an entertaining dose of nostalgia. Tourists enjoy boarding the brightly colored cars and zooming to their destinations just as locals have been doing for decades."

Declared a micro-nation by residents on April 1st, 1997, this community of artists and free spirits may or may not be playing an extended April Fool’s Joke. If so, they sure are committed. If it’s a joke, it’s an elaborate one. A president and cabinet of ministers have been elected. An anthem has been composed and a constitution authored. Currency has been created and circulated. A flag flies (four flags, actually, one for each season) and an army has been mobilized… with 11 troops in all. Their Independence Day, called “Užupis Day” of course, takes place on April 1st; be sure to take your passport as this is the only day you’ll get it stamped. While their military couldn’t exactly be considered formidable, the same can’t be said about their constitution. The 39 articles embodying Užupis can be found on a public wall, transcribed in 23 different languages. The articles swing from community-minded (2. Everyone has the right to hot water, heating in winter, and a tiled roof); to obvious (30. Everyone has the right to have brothers, sisters, and parents); to obscure (37. Everyone has the right to have no rights); to just plain weird (13. A cat is not obliged to love its owner, but must help in time of need).

Created by sculptor Romas Vilčiauskas, the little bronze mermaid has become an emblem of the Užupis neighborhood. It has been likened to Copenhagen’s Little Mermaid and is surrounded by the local superstition that those who fail to resist the mermaid’s charms will live out their days in Užupis. Užupis, which is largely located in Vilnius’ Old Town, is a beautiful enclave of history, street art, and historic homes. So, staying in Užupis would not be the worst of fates. The mermaid sits perched in a little brick enclave. Her tail poised ever so slightly to the side, her bare chest exposed to the sun, her snake-like hair seemingly splayed out in all directions like Medusa. It is the mermaid’s facial expression that is the most intriguing. With a look that is at once sad and longing, the mermaid of Užupis almost seems to be begging for company. In 2004, the beloved mermaid sculpture was lost to the rising waters of the Vilnia River. Thankfully, the statue was found and restored to its little perch from which travelers and locals alike can see her. The mermaid is said to be a symbol of love, temptation, intuition, hope, and power that attracts travelers from all over the world.  The mermaid sculpture is found on the bank of the Vilnia River, near the intersection of Maironio g. and Užupio g."
91,Paulava Republic (Pavlov Republic),"Merkinė, Lithuania","Once known throughout Europe, this tiny and unusually progressive 18th century micro-nation within Lithuania now lies in ruins.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paulava-republic-pavlov-republic,"Few people are aware that in the 18th century, within tiny Lithuania existed an even smaller country. A mere 6.3 square miles, it was at the time the second smallest country in the world. But what it lacked in size it made up in its progressiveness. While surrounding countries lived in the ages of serfdom, peasants here had personal freedom. The country had its own money, army, president, peasant parliament and even constitution. The brave mini-state existed for 30 years, but now it is passing into silence. Today the mysterious ruins of old buildings are the among the only remnants of the story of the Pavlov (Paulava) Republic. The story began when Polish-Lithuanian noble Paweł Ksawery Brzostowski—a parson, philanthropist, writer and enlightener—purchased Merkinė manor. In the barren lands peasants lived in the grip of poverty. Abruptly and to the surprise of other noblemen in 1769, P. K. Brzostowski issued law in his new lands. The law announced the birth of a new Republic in which serfdom was abolished, and peasants were recognized as people with free will, with their own property, land and rights. Instead of serfdom, they paid taxes as land tenants. Meanwhile in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, peasants weren’t even recognized as citizens. In the Paulava Republic, people could freely engage in trading and crafts. President Brzostowski soon established schools for the peasants. Interestingly, the country had compulsory elementary schools and agriculture school with specializations. Brzostowski also ordered to let women study as well—quite a novelty in 18th century Europe. The country had government, police, and an army which if needed could defend the country’s independence with ʻʻgun and pommel.’’ It had medical healthcare, a financial aid system and currency. Every four years, the government summoned all citizens into assembly where a population census and conversations with the people took place. The micro-nation had a capital city, Pavlov, with a city hall, churches, an inn and dozens o houses. The ruins of the capital survived until today. The country also had four villages: Brzostow, Ksawerov, Zamojscė and Pavlov. At the time, rumors about the success of this upstart country spread across the Europe. The king of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Stanisław August Poniatowski, officially accepted the existence of the new country in his kingdom. But the Paulava Republic’s luck ran out when it became evident that the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth would fall and the country would be taken over by Russian empire. They restored the serfdom. During World War II, the former republic was a home for nuns. After the war the buildings were left to their own fate. In recent years, trees and bushes that masked the territory have been cut, footpaths made and a monument for the founder of Pavlov Republic, P. K. Brzostowski, was built. It’s possible to explore the ruins of this former country that was once a hundred years ahead of its time.  It is only 35 km away from Vilnius. Be aware, that the place is near the village Merkinė and must not be confused with Merkinė city in Alytus county. So it is best to get where by using GPS coordinates."
92,Pan House,"Žagarė, Lithuania",What almost started out as a spite house became an eccentric's found object masterpiece.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pan-house,"An unconventional man, Edmundas Vaiciulis always preferred to do things his way. Educated to be a mechanical engineer, Vaiciulis’ refusal to conform to the dress code at work led to his career in the field lasting about one week. This only strengthened his dedication to individualism, and his voice was a loud one when it came to politics and community business in his Lithuanian town of Zagaré. His engineering skills and colorful personality naturally led him towards artwork, and he began to carve large wooden sculptures; busts and bears and old men, all out of former tree trunks. When privatization was introduced after the Soviet Union split in the early 1990s, Vaiciulis purchased half of a house, which he was set on rebuilding. Unfortunately, the neighbors who shared ownership had no interest in the lofty endeavor, and so Vaiciulis had to find a different way to make it his. His neighbors had to agree to rebuild the infrastructure, but designing the outside was something they had little jurisdiction on. Vaiciulis began to make his house as unique and unconventional as he was. Soon, the outside of the house was slowly but surely covered in found objects. Pots and pans made up the bulk of the unusual siding, but metal plates and a plethora of household objects, as well as machine parts and random metal pieces were thrown into the mix. The garden was filled with many of his wooden sculptures along with more found objects of interest, and the barn wall was adorned with several animal skulls. Called “The Pan House” Vaiciulis’ house is now the most photographed home in Zagaré, and welcomes individuals and groups to come and take a look."

First built around 920, the castle was originally an eight-meter-tall tower atop the tallest hill in the area, which was subsequently surrounded by farm buildings. It was not until later on in the 13th century that the tower was expanded upon, creating a more traditional castle-like structure. This final expansion of the site was carried out by the final couple of Counts of Esch, who gave the town (and its castle), their name. The village around the castle also grew steadily alongside its proud central tower. With advances in warfare, the town eventually built a wall around the entirety of Esch-sur-Sûre, adding a couple of smaller lookout towers that accented the more ancient one. However by the 1700s, the castle had fallen to the common folk of the village, many of whom moved into the ancient site. Villagers were still known to be living in the castle at least up until the late 1800’s. Today the castle continues to stand proudly above the town of Esch-sur-Sûre, even though it is in ruins. The site is now protected as a historic treasure and is illuminated in the evenings, giving the site a feeling of true fantasy magic."
94,Schiessentümpel,"Beidweiler, Luxembourg",This tri-part waterfall is a little bit of fairytale beauty in the heart of Luxembourg's Little Switzerland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/schiessentumpel,"In the eastern region of Luxembourg there is an area known as Little Switzerland that is said have remarkably similar geography. In the heart of this region and pretty much exemplifying the aesthetic is a lovely wooded waterfall called the Schiessentümpel. Part of the Black Ernz river, the Schiessentümpel cascades over a large boulder, and in doing so splits the flow a trio of clear streams, before they collect once again at the bottom of the falls. The water is split due to three long grooves that have been eroded into the boulder over the ages, making it look almost like a giant hand is allowing the water to sieve through its fingers. Of course this happens at the bottom of a small ravine which has also been carved out of the rock by the ages of water flowing over its surface, leaving two sheer walls on either side of the waterfall. To make the scene even more of a J.R.R. Tolkien dream, a crudely designed rock and wood bridge has been installed over the ravine to bridge the gap. The crooked wood rails of the arch make it look like it was made by some elvish woodspeople. The waterfall and its fantastical bridge are a favorite location for locals and tourists who want to make their lives a little more unbelievable. The Schiessentümpel might be a symbol of Little Switzerland, but it could just as easily have been a favorite spot in a Little Middle-Earth, which we can only hope more cities will begin to try and identify."
95,Bock Casemates,"Luxembourg, Luxembourg",An expansive complex of subterranean tunnels is all that remains of one of Europe's most formidable medieval fortresses.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bock-casemates,"Once known as the Gibraltar of the North, the mighty fortifications of Luxembourg were first built in 963. Over the following centuries, the city was held in turn by Burgundians, Spaniards, Austrians, French, and Prussians, as each group vied for military control of Western Europe. Finally demolished in the late 19th century to prevent further conflict, the Bock Casemates are the only part of this formidable stronghold that remain largely intact. The Bock is the name for both the fortress erected by Count Siegfried in the 10th century, and the imposing rocky promontory on which it was built. Originally constructed as an impregnable position from which to protect Siegfried’s holdings, over time the Bock became strategically critical to dominating the west bank of the Rhine, projecting power across the French-German border, and controlling the Low Countries. As such, the defensive structures of the site were continually expanded and improved upon by each subsequent owner. The fortress’s casemates (i.e., fortified gun emplacements) were started by the Spanish in 1644, using the cellars of the medieval castle as their basis. Extended by the noted French fortification engineer Vauban in the 1680s and fully realized by the Austrians in the mid-18th century, the Bock Casemates were ultimately much more than cannon perches. Consisting of 23 kilometers (14 miles) of tunnels delving as deep at 40 meters (130 feet) below the fortress above, they included not only 25 artillery slots but also stables, storehouses, workshops, kitchens, bakeries, slaughterhouses, and barracks for 1200 soldiers. A well 47 meters (155 feet) deep supplied the installation with fresh water. The casemates helped the Bock resist a seven-month siege by the French Republican Army in 1794; when the Habsburg forces in the fortress eventually surrendered, the walls remained unbreached. Ultimately, the Bock proved too valuable, and its destruction (as well as the perpetual neutrality of Luxembourg) was ordered by the 1867 Treaty of London in an effort to defuse tensions between France and Germany. The demolition took 16 years to complete. However, the casemates could not be destroyed without also destroying part of the city, so 17 kilometers of the subterranean tunnels still remain. The Bock Casemates were opened to the public in 1933, and were used as a bomb shelter for 35,000 people during World War II. Visitors today can still descend from the heights of the Bock to explore the expansive honeycomb military engineering marvel below."
96,Beaufort Castles,"Beaufort, Luxembourg","This noble mash-up in eastern Luxembourg is part Medieval, part Renaissance, all castle.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/beaufort-castle,"First built in the 11th century as a small fortress on a rock, Beaufort Castle had the requisite moat and stone walls of Medieval European castles. But it didn’t stay small for long, and by the 12th century a “keep” had been added – a kind of fortified, giant family room that was inserted into some castle grounds in case things got dicey with invasions and all. You might call it a kind of knightly safe-room. Adding the keep was the first expansion of the Castle, but it kept expanding, and by the 14th century a daughter of the Beaufort family married a son of the powerful Orley family, and the Castle became property of the House of Orley. The newlyweds had to expand their humble abode a little more of course, and the Castle grew bit by bit over the next hundred years or so, when it changed hands again. The Beaufort-Orley folks had a little scandal (a “breach of trust” as it was called), and Beaufort Castle was repo’d by Maximillian of Austria (who just happened to be the Holy Roman Emperor at the time), and given to a nobleman named Johann Bayer von Boppard – a truly excellent name. Add another hundred years and another Lord, and by 1539 the Medieval Castle found itself in the hands of a Renaissance man: Bernard von Velbrück. He added some pretty fancy Renaissance flair, including a big new wing in the Château style, and windows with crosses as part of new walls that were plopped right on top of the old ones. The next owner didn’t fare so well as von Velbrück. As a supporter of the House of Orange and the Dutch revolt against Spanish rule, the Spanish thanked Gaspard de Heu by capturing him, accusing him of heresy and treason, and executing him in the local fish market. (It might be fair to say that he didn’t expect the Spanish Inquisition…) As we all know, it’s hard to keep a castle up, and over the next few hundred years it changed hands again, but fell into disrepair. It took a couple of hundred years after the last full-time residents abandoned the Castle, but eventually, by the early 20th century, a new owner found the wherewithal (and the money) to restore it to such an extent that by 1928 the grounds – including both the Medieval and Renaissance sides – were opened to the public. And since 1988 it has been a Luxembourg national monument. On town road 128 (Rue du Château), just outside of the town of Beaufort"
97,Hohllay Cave,"Berdorf, Luxembourg",This Luxembourg cave is covered in cryptic looking marks left by mining activity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hohllay-cave,"Entering Luxembourg’s Hohllay Cave, one might be forgiven for thinking that it was once home to an order of druids or some other  ancient sect thanks to strange marking covering the cave walls. But really it’s just mining scars. Located in a forested area of the Little Switzerland section of Luxembourg, the Hohllay Cave has been the site of mining since medieval times. Also known as The Hollow Cave or the Breechkaul Cave, the low-ceilinged cavern was created when the rock was used to create circular millstones. This mining lasted into the 19th century, leaving the entire cave marked in eerie, scalloped designs from the cutting. There are also pillars that were left as supports, giving the cave a somewhat cathedral feel. It also acts as a natural amphitheater and concerts are now held there as weather permits. The cave is also a popular hiking destination. There are plenty of caves with actual petroglyphs and ancient designs for archaeologists to pore over. But it took some marks from simple industry to create the beauty and mystery of the Hohllay Cave."
98,Belval Blast Furnaces,"Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg",Two standing giants remain as a tribute to Luxembourg's metallurgical past.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/belval-furnaces,"In the heart of the campus of the University of Luxembourg, surrounded by the modern buildings of the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology, stand two tall blast furnaces. These holdovers from the region’s industrial past recall a time when Luxembourg was one of Europe’s principal sources of iron ore. At the time of its independence in 1867, the landlocked Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was one of the poorest nations in Europe. However, during the 20th century, a competitive steel industry is developed in the southwestern part of the country along the border of France—an area known as the “red lands.” Much of Luxembourg’s current prosperity was built on the exploitation of the region’s rich stores of iron ore. Despite its small size, Luxembourg was once the seventh-largest iron producer in the world. It was one of the six founding members of the European Coal and Steel Community, which laid the early foundations for the European Union. Around 1910, the forest surrounding the small town of Esh-sur-Alzette was cut down to build Belval’s ironworks. More than 3,000 men worked at the site, which was home to three massive blast furnaces. In 1993, a switch was made to electric furnaces, and in 1997, the country’s last active blast furnace was shut down for good. As the steel industry in Luxembourg declined, the economy diversified into production of construction materials, engineering, and chemical manufacturing. The furnaces of Belval were integrated into the main campus of the University of Luxembourg. Since 2014, the furnaces have been open to the public, who can follow the self-guided tour to learn more about their functioning and the history of the iron industry in the region. Moreover, it is possible to climb up to a 40-meter (131-foot) platform on the furnace “A”, to the level of the feedstock inlet, and discover an impressive panorama on the region. The furnaces are also open several nights a year, during which visitors are able to roam the furnaces with hard helmets and frontal lamps.  The furnaces are open to visitors between April and October, Wednesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Admission costs €5. The Belval-University train station is very close to the furnaces, and has regular trains from and to Luxembourg City."
99,Melusina Statue,"Luxembourg, Luxembourg",This magenta statue commemorates the legendary marriage between a mermaid and the city's founder.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/melusina-statue,"Medieval legends about a legendary figure known as the melusine or melusina can be found throughout Europe, from Germany to Albania. Similar to a water elemental or fairy, the melusine is typically depicted as a mermaid, sometimes with a dragon’s tail from the waist down. In Luxembourg, legend has it that Count Siegfried, who founded the city of Luxembourg in 963, married one of the legendary creatures. After hearing the singing of a beautiful maiden, Siegfried was entranced. The maiden agreed to marry the Count as long as she was allowed to be left alone every Saturday. The morning after their wedding, a castle, known as Lucilinburhuc, magically appeared on Bock, an area in the northeastern corner of Luxembourg City’s historic district. Eventually, after the pair had seven children, curiosity got the better of Siegfried. He snuck in and took a peek at his wife while she bathed through the keyhole. Siegfried saw his wife combing her long hair in a tub of water, but when he looked down at her legs, he say they were replaced with a long serpent’s tail. In an instant, she was gone, disappearing into the depths of the Alzette river. Since then, it has been said that melusine returns every seven years in human form to seek redemption. Another version of the story says she holds a key, and that she can only leave the river if the key is taken from her. If you take a walk along the Alzette, you may find a magenta, polygonal statue of the mythic mermaid seated on the bank. Local artist Serge Ecker created the statue in 2015, utilizing 3D printing, to belatedly celebrate the country’s 1050th anniversary. The statue was also featured on the commemorative 10-Euro gold coin issued in 2021 for a limited number of 1,500."
100,Old Watertrough of Stone,"Saeul, Luxembourg","Resting peacefully between two majestically-slanted trees, this roadside water trough circulates water peacefully.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-watertrough-stone,"Resting peacefully between two majestically-slanted trees, the Old Watertrough of Stone circulates water peacefully at the roadside. Based on the carving style, cistern shape, and the worn smoothness of the stone, the water trough appears to be a Belgian bluestone horse trough made between the 17th and 19th centuries. The stone has held up remarkably, but it has also softened from use over time. The trough is roughly 300 centimeters long and 50 centimeters wide, with 26 centimeters exposed above the ground. The water cistern depth measured 32 centimeters to the bottom, which included a large amount of sediment. There were nine centimeters of fresh water above the sediment, meaning the trough extends at least six centimeters below the ground level, due to the difference in depth of the cistern and the exposed trough. Each end of the trough gives ample flat space for setting and filling jugs or just taking a rest. When looking at the Old Watertrough of Stone with your back to the road, you can see the water entering the trough on the left, circulating through the cistern, then draining out on the right side. It creates a beautiful sound that washes away stress. The views while stilling on the trough were lovely. In summer, grass grows up around the trough, making it harder to find.  No dedicated parking is available near this site, so use caution when pulling over to park and walking along the country road where the Watertrough is situated. No indication is given as to whether the water is potable, so drinking the water is not recommended."

Created in 1987, the Saltimbanques, or “acrobats,” sculptures were designed by local artist Bénédicte Weis, who won the first prize at a national competition with the design a year prior. The bronze statues depict a group of street performers in medieval attire, including a clown and a fire-breather, as well as a whole troupe of dancers and musicians. Traveling performers like these are believed to have been quite common in Luxembourg during the Middle Ages. The statues are both a tribute to the city’s history and the timeless nature of the arts.   The sculptures are a favorite photo-op for visitors to the city."

The live-action film based on the popular comic strip and animation character, a spinach-loving sailor, marked the film debut of Robin Williams in the title role. Over 20 wooden structures were built with the tree trunk logs imported from Holland and wooden shingles brought in from Canada, making the town quite the production. Eight tons of nails and 250 gallons of paint were used in constructing the set, and a 250-foot breakwater was built to protect the filming area from the high seas. The film itself was a box-office bomb. But rather than tearing the set down or leaving it abandoned, the islanders saw it for what it was: a pre-built theme park. They eventually took over the abandoned set, hired actors, and the Popeye Village was born.  Boat trips and some parts of the village are not open during off seasons or when the weather is bad. Entrance fees and special package costs also vary by season."
103,Mnajdra,"Qrendi, Malta",Stone Age solar temple is aligned with the sun on each equinox and solstice.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mnajdra,"Mnajdra (“mna-ee-dra”) is a Neolithic temple complex on the southern coast of Malta, less than a kilometer from the famous Hagar Qim temple. Built around the fourth millennium BCE, Mnajdra is among the world’s most ancient religious sites. It is also the site of an astronomically aligned solar temple, positioned so that the sun’s light illuminates the structure in special ways on equinoxes and solstices. At sunrise on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, when the earth is tilted neither away nor towards the sun, brilliant rays of sunlight penetrate the door of Mnajdra’s lower temple and light up the building’s main axis. And on the summer and winter solstices, when the earth’s spin axis is tilted the farthest amount towards and away from the sun, respectively, the sun’s beams fall directly on the edges of megaliths to the right and left of the temple’s central passage. According to archaeologists, Mnajdra also served as the backdrop for ceremonial sacrifice. This notion is evidenced by the flint knives, restraining ropes, and animal remains found at the site. The presence of stone benches and tables also suggests the temple may have had a sort of medical function, serving as a center for healing and promoting fertility. Since 2009, the temples have been covered by a metal truss and fabric canopy to protect the soft stone from erosion and deterioration in the elements. These structures were built without disturbing the site, and do not obstruct sunlight during the astronomical alignment. Bus: 32, 35"
104,Maltese Catacomb Complexes,"Rabat, Malta","The remains of more than 1,000 people lie deep under the modern town of Rabat.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maltese-catacomb-complexes,"From the 3rd to the 6th centuries, the Roman city of Melite developed a complex system of burial grounds on its outskirts under the modern town of Rabat, a village outside of Mdina, the medieval capital of Malta. Roman law prohibited burials within the city, which derives its name from the Arabic word for suburb. Known today as St. Paul’s and St. Agatha’s catacombs, the burial grounds form an important part of Malta’s early Christian history. The catacombs include tombs for more than 1,000 bodies in 2,200 square meters. The organizational and architectural complexity of the catacombs points to the ritual importance of burial grounds in early Christianity. The catacombs were planned in a centralized manner, providing private space for numerous family units, while leaving a lot of communal space for festivals and rituals. The entrance to the main complex of St. Paul’s leads to two large halls, adorned with pillars made to resemble Doric columns and painted plasters. The main hall is equipped with large circular tables and couches, carved out of rock. They were probably used during burial rituals and festivals of the dead. In some places the burial corridors were cut in three subterranean stories. The catacombs were abandoned sometime in the 7th century during the later stages of the Byzantine Empire. They were reopened during the re-Christianization of the Island after 220 years of Fatimid rule. The catacombs became a popular site for religious pilgrimages in the 12th century and a Christian shrine was recut in the 13th century. There are a number of smaller catacombs dating back to antiquity in Malta. One was rediscovered within a traffic roundabout close to the Malta International Airport in 2006. The Hal Resqun tomb was originally excavated in 1912. Soon after its discovery, the catacomb was covered up by a road surface, following the development of the Luqa Airfield.  Hours: Monday to Sunday: 09.00-17.00hrs. Last admission at 16.30hrs. Closed on 24, 25 & 31 December, 1 January & Good Friday"
105,St. John’s Co-Cathedral Skeleton Tombstones,"Valletta, Malta",The floor of this spectacular Baroque sanctuary is covered in memento mori.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-john-s-co-cathedral-skeleton-tombstones,"While exploring St. John’s Co-Cathedral, it’s easy to be dazzled by the gilded walls and ceilings adorned with historic frescoes and glittering gold leaf. But don’t let this ornate splendor steal all your attention. Be sure to turn your gaze downward, too, to admire its marble floor covered with images of skeletons. The story of these cadavers is inextricably linked with the history of the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. In 1530, the Knights were given permanent headquarters on Malta and the island of Gozo. In return, they had to send a single Maltese falcon to the King of Spain each year on All Saints’ Day as payment. The presence of the knights here was considered important for maritime defense, as the Mediterranean was then a region of continuous conflict. Barbary pirates in search of slaves raided towns and cities, and the Turkish Ottoman Empire continued its military expansion. Such a danger would soon become a gruesome reality, when in 1565, the Sultan of Turkey, Suleiman the Great, sent a force of 40,000 men to invade and conquer the island, which was then defended by only 700 knights and 8,000 soldiers. Heavily outnumbered, the besieged Knights lost approximately half of their men in battle and many more of the ordinary soldiers lost their lives too, though Malta did win the battle. The decadent cathedral that stands today was built between 1572 and 1577. The nearly 400 Knights who fell during the Great Siege of Malta were originally buried elsewhere, but were later reinterred within the spectacular structure. The skeleton-covered floor is comprised of their tombstones.  The Cathedral of St. John is in center of Valleta and is open Monday to Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and on Saturdays from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The entrance fee costs €10 Euro. The skeletons themselves are very easy to find, as they feature in almost every image on the floor."
106,Secret Passage in St. Gregory's,"Iż-Żejtun, Malta",A hidden tunnel of bones in one of Malta's oldest churches.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/secret-passage-in-st-gregorys,"In the 1960s, locals discovered a secret passageway in one of the oldest churches in Malta. Within, they found a wooden shoe sole, a small wooden cross, three coins, pieces of pottery, chainmail armour, and a large pile of human bones. St. Catherine’s Old Church sits on the outskirts of Żejtun. It’s dedicated to St. Catherine of the Wheel, but locals call it Saint Gregory’s for a traditional procession held yearly on the first Wednesday after Easter Sunday. Very little remains of the original medieval church, built before 1436. The church’s present edifice is a fusion of Gothic and Romanesque and dates back to the 16th century. Its dome is one of the oldest Maltese cupolas. Around the dome is a secret passage built in the walls of the southern transept. The passage is U-shaped and contains a large number of human bones. Local legend claims that the people were buried alive within these passages during the siege of 1614. Studies conducted between 1978 and 1980 concluded that the bones were probably exhumed and moved there from a cemetery, and that the deaths had all occurred around the same time. For about three centuries St. Gregory’s served as the parish church for all of southeast Malta. The church once doubled as a watchtower; the orientation of the southeast transept of the church is aligned with the bays of Marsaxlokk harbour, St. Thomas Bay, and Marsascala Bay. The church occupies the highest point that overlooks the harbours in the south, a once frequent landing spot for Barbary pirates. The secret tunnel was ideal for the lookouts who watched for pirates in the bays. Unwanted landings were communicated to French troops in the north via smoke signals from the roof of the church. The church is generally not opened. They only open it a handful of days a year, on special local holidays."
107,Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum,"Paola, Malta",This subterranean necropolis holds three floors of antler-dug grave caves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hal-saflieni-hypogeum,"A labyrinthine early neolithic catacomb complex and the burial ground of about… 7000 bodies or so. Inhabitants of the small and arid island nation Malta have been digging cisterns for water storage for eons, but in 1902, while laborers worked on one, they stumbled into one of the most remarkable and well preserved neolithic sanctuaries yet found. Buried only 10 meters beneath unpromising city streets lies an incredible network of elliptical chambers and winding corridors cut into the limestone. It is the only prehistoric burial site that is open to the public and is recognized by UNESCO. It is believed that its first chambers were cut into a small natural cave around 4000 BCE or earlier. Two even deeper levels are believed to have been finished centuries later, between 3000 and 2500 BCE. For context, the first megaliths at Stonehenge are thought to have been raised around 2500. The Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum is also unique in that certain chambers, notably the “Holy of Holies” have shed light on what the insides of prehistoric structures may have looked like. For instance the corbelled ceiling has been taken as a hint that the temples on Malta’s surface, now uncovered, could have once sported similar roofs. The Oracle Chamber has beautiful red-ochre spiral motifs, while others house bones and clay figurines, or simply water. Certain walls reveal that the complex was excavated by drilling the walls with antlers and then using stone (obsidian, flint, and chert) tools to break away the rock. No matter how it was made, the Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum makes for a fascinating underground kingdom that makes modern burial techniques look quaint. Advance reservations required. UNESCO limits the number of people admitted to 60 per day to carefully regulate light and Carbon Dioxide levels. Tickets now available online!"
108,The Old Prison,"Victoria, Malta","This prison on the Maltese island of Gozo is almost 500 years old, and they have the graffiti to prove it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-old-prison-victoria-malta,"The nation of Malta is an archipelago of 21 islands, the second largest being Gozo, home to the Citadel, an ancient fortified city within a city. Inside the walls you’ll find the Old Prison, where you can get a glimpse into some pretty grim prison-digs from centuries gone by. Covering the walls and floors is centuries of graffiti, etched-in proof that carving your initials and crude drawings go back long before “Kilroy was here.” Known simply as “The Old Prison,” it was an active jail beginning in the mid-16th century, originally run by the Crusades-era Knights of St. John. At the time it was used for knights who were a little rowdier than the others, and their 5x10-foot block cells gave them some time to cool their heels, and apparently let off a little artistic steam. Much of the graffiti relates to the knights and their symbols, including crosses, medallions known as the “Malta Cross,” and lots of plain old handprints, names, and dates. There are also some intricate carvings of ships, some with multiple planks on the hulls. One theory is that the planks were used as a kind of calendar system for the prisoners, as a tally of their time served. The Old prison was later controlled by the British after the Knights were kicked out of Malta, and it was in some use up until 1962 when it closed completely, eventually being meticulously restored for visitors to see. Notable prisoners included Jean Parisot de La Valette, the founder of Malta’s capital city of Valleta, who spent four months there in 1538. He was convicted of attacking a man, and he later went on to become the Grand Master of the Order of St. John. Not bad for an ex-convict. The Old Prison is in the fortified Citadel of the capital city of Victoria on the island of Gozo, the second largest of the many islands that make up the archipelago of Malta. The Prison is open every day from 9am to 5pm (last entry at 4:30) except holidays. Admission is €8 for adults, €5 for age 12-17 and seniors, €4 for age 6-11, and under age 6 are free. Your admission also gets you into other Citadella Sites, the Folklore Museum, the Gozo Archaeology Museum, and the Natural Science Museum."

They were built sometime during the fourth century AD and were rediscovered in 1891. The Ta’ Bistra catacombs are important because they could potentially reveal the burial rituals of some of Malta’s earliest Christian dwellers. They’re the largest set of catacombs that have been found outside Rabat, where the island’s more famous catacombs are located. The site is 300 feet long and consists of 57 tombs laid out in 16 chambers. It was excavated in 1933. Unfortunately, the farmhouse that was built on top of the catacombs had caused some damage to the ancient chambers. At one point, the tombs were occasionally used as an animal pen, while during World War II, the catacombs also served as an air raid shelter. The farmhouse has since been converted into a visitor center. The visitor center, and the catacombs, are wheelchair friendly. Opening Hours: every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Last admission is at 4:30. Closed on December 24, 25, and 31, January 1, and Good Friday."
110,Jesus Tree of Malta,"Mdina, Malta",The Jesus tree of Malta bears a striking resemblance to Christ on the cross.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jesus-tree-malta,"According to Maltese legend, a local tree was struck by lightning many years ago, and changed in appearance. Its contorted bark metamorphosed into an image of Jesus hanging from the cross. Although the Catholic Church officially recognizes miracles, it has declared that these types of apparitions are no longer worthy of “public revelation.” The issue of public vs. private revelation has been a contentious one for the Church, but was recently clarified by the current pope, Joseph Ratzinger. Ratzinger declared that public revelations (essentially big, flashy miracles), ended with the death of the last living Apostle in 100 A.D. Apparitions, even though officially recognized by the church, are now deemed to be “private revelations,” which means one doesn’t have to believe in them. Such revelations are binding on whoever has them, but not upon all Catholics. Of course, for non-believers the tree is neither public nor private revelation, but rather an example of the psychological phenomenon of pareidolia, the perception of meaningful significance in a meaningless, random stimulus. Regardless of religion, these sorts of images of Jesus, Mary, the name of Allah, or a Singaporean monkey god, continue to appear in the oddest of places, and to intrigue the faithful. The Jesus Tree of Malta is located right off the main road from Zebbug to the walled city of Mdina, the former home of the Knights Hospitalier.  Take the road from Zebbug to Mdina. After leaving Zebbug, at the base of Mdina, there's a round-about. Proceed up towards Mdina, and the tree is located approximately half way up on right-hand side. You'll notice first all the flowers, plaques and homage that locals place daily at the foot of the tree."
111,Valletta Tunnels,"Valletta, Malta",A centuries-old forgotten underworld lies beneath Malta.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/valletta-tunnels,"Located between North Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, with the deepest port in the Mediterranean Sea, Malta’s capital, Valletta, has long been a strategic fortress. And while the city’s walls protected it from the outside, a network of tunnels underneath the city have also provided protection for centuries. Malta was part of the Kingdom of Sicily until 1530, when Holy Roman Emperor Charles V leased the archipelago to the Knights of the Hospital of St. John. Today, we know them as the Knights of Malta. At the time, the price per year for the country was a single falcon. The first recorded instance of the tunnels was during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565. The Ottoman Empire, recognizing the Malta’s importance, attacked the island. As part of their defense, the Knights of Malta dug tunnels underneath the area that would later become the capital city’s place to store water and food. It was even said that during the siege, Ottoman troops and the Knights of Malta both dug tunnels in their battle for the fort, leading to subterranean clashes when one side would break through into the tunnels of the other. The tunnels underneath Valletta were not purely defensive. Archaeologists say that some are the remnants of a sewer system that was more advanced than many in Europe at the time. Though the Knights of Malta were dispelled from the island by Napoleon in 1798, Valletta’s tunnels continued to be integral to the geography of the city, and during World War II, they were the difference between life and death for many locals. As a British colony at the time, Malta was brutally bombed by the Axis Powers in an attempt to take the island and solidify their hold on the North African front. In the course of two years, Axis forces flew more than 3,000 bomb raids over the island, dropping thousands of explosives as they passed. The inhabitants of Valletta took shelter in the city’s secret tunnels. City residents even dug new tunnels in their homes or businesses where they hid with supplies from the constant air attacks. But Malta held, the key to Allied defense of the Mediterranean. After the war, Valletta’s tunnels became dormant, until 2009, when a series of tunnels beneath the city was discovered during an archaeological survey to build a new parking garage. Today, some of the tunnels are being restored for public access, but many more still lie quiet and undisturbed beneath the city. The map coordinates are for the Knights Hospitallers history museum, near which a tunnel entrance was discovered."
112,Domvs Romana,"Rabat, Malta",The remains of a 1st-century aristocratic Roman town house featuring beautiful well-preserved mosaics.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/domvs-romana,"On the border between Mdina and Rabat in Malta there is a small museum built around the ancient ruins of an aristocratic town house, or domus, from the Roman era. The ruins were accidentally discovered by landscapers in 1881, and while little remains of the house itself, the beautiful floor mosaics have survived the centuries remarkably intact, one of the best examples of Hellenistic style mosaics found today. Archaeologists determined the Roman villa was built in the 1st century BC, inspired by ancient Greek architecture, and was lived in up until the 2nd century AD. The domus had a colonnaded peristyle featuring intricate Hellenistic style mosaics that are the highlight of the site today, some depicting mythological scenes and others simply decorative. The fine painting and architectural elements would place the mosaic art somewhere between the 1st and 2nd Pompeian styles. But unlike its counterpart in Pompeii and Sicily, the mosaics at Domvs Romana have survived largely intact. At the purpose-built, on-site museum, domestic artifacts and antiquities are on display giving a glimpse of daily life of a wealthy Roman family. There are also a number of well-preserved 1st century statues of the imperial Roman family. However, the site is not confined to the Roman people alone. In the 11th century, while Malta was part of the Fatimid Caliphate, a Muslim cemetery was established on the remains of the domus. At least 245 burials were discovered during the excavations, which also unearthed a number of limestone and marble tombstones with Naskh or Kufic inscriptions.  Not all of the Roman ruins can be accessed, but can be viewed from the museum's patio. Museum Hours: Tuesday to Sunday: 09.00 - 17.00hrs Last admission at 16.30hrs Closed on 24, 25 & 31 December, 1 January & Good Friday Currently closed on Mondays whilst archaeological work continues on the grounds."
113,St. Cataldus Catacombs,"Ir-Rabat, Malta","Overshadowed by other, more famous Maltese catacombs, this ancient burial chamber has one of the best examples of a ritual agape table.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-cataldus-catacombs,"This small church in Rabat is one of the few tributes to Saint Cataldus, the bishop of Tatanto in Apulia and a rather obscure Irish saint propagated by the Normans, who likely introduced him to the island of Malta. The ancient catacombs that lie beneath the church are often overshadowed by Malta’s more well-known St. Paul and St. Agada catacombs. But this little gem is worth a visit. Notably, the St. Cataldus catacombs hold one of the best examples of an agape table, a circular platform hewn out of the rock used for early Christian funerary rituals. After a body was interred, and once a year on the anniversary of the burial, relatives would gather in the catacomb for a celebratory meal to commemorate the dead. The catacombs are accessed by a steep staircase in the church. The stairway leads to a vault that opens into the Baldachin-style tombs, where an arch in the corner is decorated with pictures of doves. Dating from the late 2nd to the 3rd centuries, these small catacombs were originally a Punic burial shaft. The graves in the catacombs are beautiful examples of canopied tombs, while many other graves are hewn in the rocks. The church is close to the main church of St. Paul, at Rabat centre."
114,Rotunda of Mosta,"Il-Mosta, Malta","This spectacular dome managed to survive after being bombed in World War II, in an event known as the ""Miracle of Mosta.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rotunda-of-mosta,"One of the most recognizable sights in the the small Maltese town of Mosta is the magnificent dome that covers the Parish Church of the Assumption. It holds a special place in the town, as it survived a bombing during World War II. On 9th April 1942, as 300 people sat in the church waiting for mass to begin, a bomb dropped by the German Luftwaffe pierced the dome, bumped into the wall, and rolled across the floor until it came to a stop. It failed to detonate, and so did two other bombs that had fallen outside. Bomb experts dismantled the explosive and disposed of it in the sea. The Maltese people viewed the escape as a miracle, and today a replica of the bomb can be seen in a sacristy at the back of the church. This lucky event spared the the parishioners as well as the neoclassical structure, whose dome, commonly called the Rotunda of Mosta, is inspired by Rome’s Pantheon and is one of the largest unsupported domes in the world. In the 1830s, Mosta’s residents raised the funds for the erection of a new church on the site of the existing one, which was carried out such that the newer structure came up around the old one which was later demolished. This ensured that there was always a church to pray at. Designed by Giorgio Grognet de Vassé, it is beautifully decorated in shades of blue, gold, and red. After 27 long years of construction, the church was  officially dedicated in 1871. The Rotunda of Mosta is situated in the centre of the town 7 miles from Valleta and 2.7 miles from Mdina."
115,The Inland Sea,"San Lawrenz, Malta",The fishing boats that moor in this small lagoon enter and leave through a tunnel to the sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/inland-sea-gozo,"Malta’s Inland Sea is a small, almost entirely landlocked lagoon whose shores are lined with small fishing boats. Incredibly, on days when the sea is calm, these boats are able to leave the sheltered harbor through a small crack in the cliffs that separate the lagoon from the Mediterranean Sea. The local fishermen increase their profits by also transporting visitors through this natural arch to view the steep limestone cliffs that surround the inlet. The area is dotted with curious rock formations to explore, such as the Fungus Rock and the Azure Window ruins (the Azure Window has sadly recently collapsed). The Inland Sea is not very deep, and you can see many small fish swimming below the surface. It is also an ideal place to dive, because it is easy to swim through the cave out into the Mediterranean, where the depth of the water plunges to 164 feet (50 meters) near the cliffs.  The sheltered lagoon, also known as Qawra, is widely considered one of the best dive sites in Malta. It is located on the western coast of the island of Gozo, in an area called Dwejra bay. Bus 311 will leave you at the roundabout at the end of the road to Dwejra, within walking distance of the Island Sea."
116,Casa Gourgion,"L-Imdina, Malta",This unique building in the main square stands out among the city's typically Baroque architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mdinas-neogothic-house,"Near the Mdina Cathedral in Malta, an architectural oddity stands out among its surrounding buildings. The residential house, designed by Andrea Vassallo, is a fairly rare example of neo-Gothic architecture in Malta. The country typically favors more Baroque designs in its buildings. The unique neo-Gothic house is now well-received by the public and tourists, though some did criticize it for its different style when it was first revealed in the early 20th century. Its ornate facade, intricate rooftop, and notable arches are telltale signs of the building’s distinct Gothic Revival architectural roots. Andrea Vassallo was an eclectic Maltese architect. His work wasn’t just limited to neo-Gothic creations. He also designed buildings in the neo-Classic, Rococo Revival, Art Nouveau, and neo-Romanesque styles. The basilica of Ta’ Pinu on Gozo, the second largest island in the Maltese archipelago, is thought to be his masterpiece. It, too, is often critiqued for standing out too much among its surrounding structures.  The house is located on Mdina's main square. Mdina was the capital of Malta until the 16th century."
117,Il-Barri Air Raid Shelter,"Mgarr, Malta","Hidden beneath a restaurant, underground tunnels tell the story of Malta’s tragic role in World War II.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ilbarri-air-raid-underground-shelter,"Sitting next to the large domed church in the Maltese town of Mgarr, Il-Barri serves up traditional dishes such as rabbit fried in garlic or wine and horse meat stewed in a rich sauce. But there’s more to this restaurant than its menu. At the back, a stone staircase leads to a dark, underground maze where families hid from bombs during World War II. The tiny Mediterranean island of Malta, a crucial base for British air and sea forces, was one of the most bombed parts of Europe in the war. During a period of sustained bombardment, 6,700 tons of bombs were dropped over 154 days and nights. Many of the inhabitants, particularly those who did not work for the British military, were forced underground into air raid shelters. It is not known how many of these shelters exist across the islands of the Maltese archipelago. Many started out as wells or storage areas, and after the end of the war, many were closed off or returned to their prewar use. Some were constructed for communal use; others were owned by individual families. Still, groups of families came together and shared these spaces. Those who lived in the harbor areas, which were the most heavily bombarded, often fled inland to the houses and air raid shelters of distant family members or friends, and were called (since they were out-of-towners) refugees. The air raid shelter at Il-Barri was, like most others, dug out by hand. The walls are rough and still show the markings of the pickaxes that were used to create this underground refuge. There is a central corridor leading all the way down to the end, with small rooms on both sides, and, uniquely, an exit to ground level at each end. The individual rooms were used by the families that could afford them, while others had to find some space for themselves and their families in the corridors, having brought with them whatever they could grab once the warning sirens went off. Other rooms had a particular purpose (a schoolroom, a chapel). Each room hints at the lives lived, loves lost, childhoods missed, and prayers made in a time when hiding underground was necessary for survival.  The air raid shelter is open for visitors Tuesdays to Saturdays between 9am and 1pm, and Sundays and holidays between 10am and 11:30am. A reservation at the restaurant is not necessary to visit the air raid shelter."
118,Transnistria,"Tiraspol, Moldova","A forgotten remnant of the Soviet Union, Transnistria is an unrecognized country hidden behind a heavily militarized border between Moldova and Ukraine.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/transnistria,"More correctly known as the ‘Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic’ (or ‘PMR’), Transnistria is one of a number of frozen conflict zones that emerged following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. (Others include the unrecognised states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia along the Russian-Georgian border, as well as Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway territory of Azerbaijan.) The name ‘Transnistria’ comes from ‘Trans Dniester’: a reference to the River Dniester, which forms the natural border between Moldova and its breakaway republic. This was the front line of a war waged between 1990 and 1992. Known as the ‘War of Transnistria,’ this bloody conflict arose when the region beyond the Dniester refused to join the newly formed Republic of Moldova - instead fighting for independence as the PMR. What was once a battlefield now forms a heavily fortified demilitarised zone between the two territories. Tourists can enter Transnistria either by train, or by driving across the border - although the latter approach means passing through various military checkpoints, complete with tanks and armed guards. While almost every other country in the world refuses to acknowledge the independence of Transnistria, this autonomous territory nevertheless features its own presidential government, a national flag, anthem and even a currency: the Transnistrian Ruble. Spreading from north to south, Transnistria covers a long, thin strip of land sandwiched between the River Dniester and the Ukrainian border. The population is approximately 470,000, with 140,000 of those living in the capital, Tiraspol. The Russian language is spoken almost exclusively in Transnistria. This unrecognised nation celebrates its Independence Day on September 2nd, a street party which is notorious for its all-out military displays, and often compared to similar displays in North Korea. One of the most notable things about Transnistria (and Tiraspol in particular) is the prevalence of Soviet symbology. While socialist monuments and busts of Lenin may still be commonplace in other former-USSR nations such as Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, Transnistria goes one step further, actually referring to itself as a ‘soviet state.’ Communist motifs appear everywhere from schools and universities, to the nation’s hammer-and-sickle flag. Meanwhile, Tiraspol’s parliament still meets in the city’s ‘Dom Sovetov,’ or, ‘House of the Soviets.’ Most tourism in Transnistria comes from the direction of Russia or Ukraine, with significantly fewer travelling from the West. Many of these visitors come to marvel at a non-nation often described as the “last outpost of the USSR,” although Transnistria also offers a range of more traditional attractions; including the Chitcani monastery, a well-preserved Ottoman fortress near the Moldovan border and the Bendery Military Museum: a fascinating collection of militaria located inside a disused Soviet train at Bendery.

119,Mileștii Mici,"Chisinau, Moldova",The largest wine cellar in the world is a 150-mile network of underground caves near the capital of Moldova.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/milestii-mici,"Milestii Mici is an underground wine storage facility in Chisinau, the capital of Moldova. Here, 40-85 meters underground, is the world’s largest wine cellar, home to the aptly named “Golden Collection” of over 2 million bottles of wine. The caves keeps the wine at a constant temperature between 12-14 degrees Celsius (53-57 degrees Fahrenheit) with constant humidity year-round. This steady environment maintains the wine to perfection and produces some of the most expensive aged red wine in the world. Created in the typical Moldovan winemaking process in a factory above ground, the collection stretches over 150 miles. It’s so large that visitors and employees navigate the underground network with bikes and cars, with each street named for the wine it holds. Although the collection is massive at present, Milestii Mici still has room to expand: Only half of the total length of the tunnels is presently being used. Tours of the wine tunnels are available every day and wine tastings and appetizers in one of the traditionally decorated Moldovan tasting rooms are available in many of the various tour packages.  Located a half-hour ride from Chisinau."
120,Wine Cellars of Cricova,"Cricova, Moldova",Seventy-five miles of limestone caves host more than a million bottles of wine beneath a sleepy Moldovan town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cricova-worlds-second-largest-wine-cellar,"Cricova takes the notion of a “wine city” to another level, in more ways than one. About 260 feet below this little-known Moldovan town, over 75 miles of limestone caves are home to about 1.3 million bottles of wine. The fertile region surrounding the town of Cricova had no problem becoming a major source of wine for the USSR by the mid-1900s. They did have a problem storing all of it, however. Conveniently, the excavation of vast amounts of limestone to build the nearby capital of Chişinău left a sprawling underground network of cool, dry caves, ideal for aging and storing wine. As more limestone was mined to build the city, more space was created underground to host an imperial collection of bottled wine. After Milestii Mici, another underground Moldovan winery, Cricova is the second-largest wine cellar on the planet. Today, the above-ground winery is a jack of all trades, producing more than 150 styles, including basics such as muscat, pinot noir, cabernet, and sauvignon blanc, but also unique local varieties such as rkaţiteli and aligote. The “streets” and “avenues” that make up the underground booze-storage metropolis are named for the wines they store, helping tour guides navigate visitors through the network by mini-train. The winery is most famous for producing a sparkling variety known as kodrinskoie, utilizing methods made famous by French monk Dom Pierre Pérignon. According to Balkan Insight, a team of five women rotates as many as 35,000 bottles of the sparkling vino 45 degrees in wooden slots to encourage the movement of sediments. Though an over-the-top underground oddity, the site was made a visiting point for all official delegations to the USSR and, even after its collapse, still holds the collections of various political heavyweights. Angela Merkel, John Kerry, Joe Biden, and Petro Poroshenko all visited and were gifted private collection spaces. Vladimir Putin has an impressive assortment of wines here, and, according to Forbes, a gold-plated mini-car to take him through the tunnels. While no politician, the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, is rumored to have gotten lost in the caves for hours (guides like to joke that it was easier for him to get into space than out of the wine cellar). Perhaps most shockingly, the wine collection of Hermann Göring, one of Hitler’s henchmen, rests here, as well. After the Red Guard took Berlin, his collection of more than 2,000 bottles from regions occupied by Germany during World War II were brought here to continue aging. After each tour, visitors can sample an array of wines in one of the facility’s five extravagant tasting rooms, including “The Sea Bottom,” a nautical-themed room; the “Presidential Hall,” meant to host official delegates; and the unambiguous “Fireplace Room.” Feel free to purchase as much wine from the store as you’d like. Cricova’s not running out any time soon.  What makes the caves perfect for wine storage is a year-round temperature of about 54 degrees Fahrenheit. Dress accordingly. Information on tours is available on Cricova's website."
121,Moldova's Little Prince Statue,"Chisinau, Moldova","At less than four inches in height, this iconic fictional character is the smallest public statue in all of Moldova.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moldovas-little-prince-statue,"Tucked away in Moldova, rests a small statue of the Little Prince, the famed character of the French writer, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The smallest public statue in all of Moldova, the Little Prince captures the whimsy and imagination of all who pass by it. In Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s timeless story, a fictional pilot crashes in the sands of the Sahara only to find himself confronted with an otherworldly fellow, the Little Prince. The seemingly simple plot weaves life-long truths into its pages, as the Little Prince encourages the pilot to look beneath the surface of what is seen and find the deeper meaning. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret,” the Little Prince confides in the pilot. “It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.” It is these nuggets of truth that have helped this novel stand the test of time. In Moldova, the Little Prince statue is so tiny that it can easily be missed. The total overall height of the bronze monument is about four inches (11 centimeters), but the Prince himself is even smaller. The statue stands on a metal fence, by a lake in Valea Morilor Park, replacing one of the spheres that adorn the fenceposts. The idea is that all of the spheres of the fence represent the planets mentioned in the novel with the Little Prince standing atop his home planet of asteroid “B-612.”  Finding the statue can be a little bit tricky, but it's well worth it. At the main entrance of the Valea Morilor Park on Strada Grigore Alexandrescu, look for stairs leading to the embankment with a small metal fence. Once at the fence, the Little Prince lives on the 23rd decorative sphere. Take a picture and touch the bronze planet, as many believe the Little Prince can bring good luck."
122,'Welcome to Gagauzia' Sign,Moldova,This sign marks the entrance to a tiny proto-state within the small country of Moldova.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/welcome-to-gagauzia,"Driving across Moldova towards the city of Ciucur-Minger, you might pass a small sign reading “Gagauziya” and below that, “Komrat Dolayi.” It would be easy to miss the fact that you have just entered a separate country… the beginnings of one at least. There are currently 195 countries and 38 dependencies (areas such as Guam and the Falkland Islands) in the world. Considering the diversity of language, heritage, and history of nearly seven-and-a-half billion people, 233 states and dependencies is shockingly small number. Enter the autonomous region. Often disputed and rarely recognized by the country they wish to secede from, around the world autonomous regions fight to represent themselves as an independent entity, and more importantly, to control their destiny. Such is the case of Gagauzia, a proto-state consisting of just three towns, separated into four geographically disconnected enclaves all contained within the borders of Moldova; Gagauzia is an archipelago of national yearning. In the late 1980s and early 1990s as the USSR began to crumble and Moldova moved towards becoming an independent country, two groups of Moldovans began to wonder if perhaps it was time to declare their own independence. Nation building, it seems, can be contagious. In the more extreme of the two cases, Transnistria (also known as Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic’ or ‘PMR’) declared war on its parent country of Moldova in 1990, a conflict which lasted two years, resulted in over a thousand deaths, and ended in a 1992 ceasefire. The conflict has never been resolved and Transnistria has been locked in a state of suspended military aggression ever since. Gagauzia meanwhile took a softer approach. Gagauzia is made up almost entirely of ethnic Gagauz, a group of Turkish speaking Bulgurs of mysterious descent. Eastern Orthodox Christians, they speak mostly Russian or Gagauz and tend to share a rose tinted vision of rule under the USSR. However unlike Transnistria the existence of Gagauzia was announced not with guns but with a referendum. In 1991 Gagauzia voted unanimously to stay in the USSR, which quickly became a moot point. The next vote was for their own independence. By 1994, the Moldovan parliament had given Gagauzia a special legal status. Not a country exactly, but the right to some self-determination. Today Gagauzia is in a perilous situation. The poorest region of the poorest country in Europe, they lack many of the basic resources to advance their proto-state. In addition, while Moldova is actively trying to make its way into the European Union, Gagauzia leans heavily towards Russia, with statues of Lenin still proudly standing outside their state buildings. With Ukraine right next door, and Moldova looking to the EU, Gagauzia starts to look a lot like the Crimea, a strategically important area with a population looking to Russia for help.

123,Bendery Military Museum,"Bender, Moldova","A unique collection of Soviet military artifacts lies hidden away in a disused train, in the unrecognized Eastern European republic of Transnistria.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bendery-military-museum-transnistria,"The Military Museum at Bendery represents a rare collection of Soviet militaria, displayed within three consecutive carriages of a decommissioned Soviet steam train. The train is located next to the town’s main station, itself no longer in use - nowadays visitors are able to wander through the grand ticket hall, admiring the elaborate socialist-realist architecture of this now-defunct state facility. There is no entrance fee at the museum, which is curated by a team of middle-aged and elderly women. None of them speak English however, instead using Russian, the region’s language of choice. The fact that you can’t understand them won’t stop these babushkas from gleefully talking you through the exhibits regardless, and the team are very accommodating to photographers. Amongst the exhibits inside the museum are a range of signed and stamped documents from Moscow, many of them bearing the portraits of Lenin and Stalin; glass displays housing period uniforms, medals and military regalia; an impressive collection of rifles, bomb shells, helmets and other military equipment; as well as a primitive handle-driven computing device, bearing a Soviet star and the letters ‘CCCP.’ The museum covers the military history of Bendery, charting the town’s involvement in numerous successive engagements: from the earlier Ottoman occupation of the area, through World War I, World War II and the 1990 War of Transnistria. Speaking of the latter, it’s important to note that while the address displayed here places the museum in Moldova, it actually falls within the widely unrecognised Soviet Socialist Republic of Transnistria. Prompted by the imminent fall of the Soviet Union, this small region declared its independence from Moldova - and the bloody conflict waged from 1990-92 was later known as the War of Transnistria. At present, an uneasy ceasefire hangs between Moldova and its breakaway state. While Transnistria (and by association, the Bendery Military Museum) remains open for international tourism, you’ll still need to get past the heavily militarised border first. Located just to the left of the disused main train station in Bendery."
124,Gypsy Hill,"Soroca, Moldova",Elaborate mansions built by Roma residents in Soroca to show their success after centuries of discrimination.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gypsy-hill,"Across the Nistru River from Ukraine sits the Moldovan town of Soroca, known as the country’s Gypsy Capital. In a country with few tourist attractions, Soroca is comparatively overflowing with them, boasting both a medieval fortress dating from the days of Ștefan cel Mare and several new “fortresses” built by members of the Roma community. The name “gypsy” is itself controversial, based on a now debunked theory that the Roma people hailed originally from Egypt. Recent evidence suggests that the group actually made their way to Europe from northern India. Because the word “gypsy” is so common, some activists advocate owning and reclaiming it; others feel the name carries too many negative connotations. (Regardless, English language speakers should definitely avoid using the word “gyp,” which is a clear racial slur.) While Roma communities have existed in Europe for a millennium or more, they have often been the target of discrimination and worse. Hundreds of thousands of Roma people were murdered during the holocaust. Today an estimated 10-12 million Roma live in Europe. The largest populations make their homes in former communist countries and nearly all are at the bottom of the economic and educational ladder. After so many centuries of struggle, it is perhaps unsurprising that those who achieve a measure of economic success want to flaunt it. So on a Sorocan hilltop, amid the broken sidewalks and barely paved roads that reflect Molodva’s status as the poorest country in Europe, Roma residents build elaborate houses, inspired by and borrowing architectural flourishes from famous buildings in wealthier countries including St Peter’s Basilica, the U.S. Capitol Building and the Bolshoi Theatre. Among the mansions is the home of true royalty, the “Gypsy King” Arthur Cherari. On Gypsy Hill (Dealul Ţiganilor in Romanian) some of the mansions are unfinished. Others lack creature comforts like indoor plumbing and electricity. Many are large enough to house dozens of people but may remain empty for long stretches of time while their owners earn money elsewhere. Regardless of what these mansions are or are not, a stroll through the neighborhood is an eye-popping experience, juxtaposing real eastern European poverty with knock-offs of wealthier worlds and ideas of what it means to have status.  The hilltop is easy to find--one can spot the gold dome from the medieval fortress by the river, the town's major tourist attraction. Be respectful about taking pictures as some are happier to show off their home than others."
125,Chisinau Jewish Cemetery,"Chisinau, Moldova",There is a mouldering Jewish cemetery hidden away in the capital of Moldova.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chisinau-jewish-cemetery,"In the outskirts of Moldova’s capital Chisinau, is a massive Jewish cemetery that lies in ruins. A little known fact, even for Moldovans living in Chisinau, is that a large Jewish cemetery can be found in the city. In the end of the 19th century there was a large Jewish community of about in Chisinau, accounting for nearly half of the Jewish population of Bessarabia. It was one of the most vibrant Jewish communities in the region. But that would all change. Tensions grew in the city and led to a small pogrom in 1903 that resulted in the tragic deaths of over 40 Jewish citizens. The 1930s marked the peak of Jewish life in Moldova. They had been granted citizenship in 1918 when Romania took control over Bessarabia and there were numerous Jewish schools and hospitals in the city. Unfortunately after 1941, around 147,000 Jewish Moldovans were deported to concentration camps, with a staggering 90,000 perishing. By the end of the 19th century there were around 25,000 graves at the cemetery but it all fell into despair after WWII, with many of the structures being destroyed by bombing. Today much of it is covered by thick vegetation and a number of the graves don’t seem to have been visited for decades."
126,Orheiul Vechi Cave Monastery,"Butuceny, Moldova",This 13th century Orthodox monastery is built right into the Moldovan cliffside.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/orheiul-vechi-cave-monastery,"The short marshrutka ride from Chişinău out to the village of Butuceni feels like traveling back in time, as drivers overtake locals in donkey carts on steep, frequently unpaved mountain roads. But the clock turns back even further in the impressive Orthodox cave monastery of Orheiul Vechi, which was dug into these rocky cliffs by local monks in the 13th century. The medieval icons below are illuminated only by candlelight and by jagged windows chiseled out of the cliff face, giving the impression that not much has changed since then. Behind the monastery, a small passage opens up onto a narrow ledge within the cliffs, providing an impressive view over the valley. The cave monastery is part of a larger archeological park in and around Butuceni, but it is by far its most impressive site. Medieval church ruins and even small museums can also be found around the village and are marked with clear signs. Other man-made cave complexes can also be spotted in the surrounding cliffs, but are generally only accessible to climbers.  Accessible via marshrutka from Chişinău's main bus station (the ones labeled 'Butuceni' or 'Orheiul Vechi', but NOT the ones labeled just 'Orheiul', which is a different village!). Get off at Butuceni. The marschrutka schedule can be awkward, so plan the timing of your return trip in advance. Parking is also available for those with personal transportation. As an orthodox holy site, modest dress (i.e. no shorts or tank tops for either sex) is expected. Female visitors are asked to cover their heads when entering the monastery, and this policy is enforced. Food and drinks are available from nearby guesthouses in the village of Butuceni."
127,Romanita Collective Housing Tower,"Chisinau, Moldova","Once the tallest building in Chisinau, this unique tower is a relic of Soviet architecture.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/romanita-tower,"The building, popularly called Romanita (“Romashka”) because of its resemblance to a flower, was once the tallest residential building in Chisinau. The stone flower rises on Mala Malina. In the 1980s, Romanita was one of the city’s most ambitious housing projects. A strange elongated shape, a futuristic “flying saucer” on the roof, a spiral staircase inside, and apartments arranged in a circle. Designed and built between 1978 and 1986, the project was the work of architect Oleg Vronsky and engineer A. Marian. Romanita stands 73 meters (240 feet) tall, with 165 apartments spread over 22 floors. Until 1997, the building was considered a dormitory, and then the legal status of the building was changed to a “residential building.” They say that in 1980 Vronsky received an order from the USSR Ministry of Construction to design a sanatorium for employees of the ministry. But history says that the ministry had more ambitious plans: there was to be a banquet hall, a cinema, a gymnasium, a library, and a restaurant on the very top of the house, which would rotate around its axis. But the architect himself has destroyed this myth: first, there is not enough space for a restaurant, and second, nothing should rotate—there was no access to such technology in Chisinau at the time. Another myth says that Romanita was conceived as a hotel and was supposed to bring income to the treasury. Regardless of which myth is closer to the truth, Romanita was built and commissioned for the more social needs of the time: housing stock."

It’s off the beaten path, and visitors will have to have to climb through an opening in the fence to find the monument since it’s tucked back near the Madison Park banquet hall. Originally, the statue was built in 1949 and was situated outside the Government House, but in 1991, it was dismantled and moved. Overall, the monument has seen its better days. Some of the tiles in the front are missing and most are loose, but overall, it is still intact and worth the visit."
129,Chisinau State Circus,"Chisinau, Moldova",This abandoned Soviet circus is slowly being restored to its Communist-era glory.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chisinau-state-circus,"An abandoned Communist-era circus in Moldova, the poorest country in Europe, is once again coming to life. The Chişinău State Circus was officially opened in 1981 and was, at the time, a top circus entertainment venue with state-of-the-art equipment and spaces for rehearsals, animals, and veterinarians. It had a capacity of 1,900 seats and the ring was over 40 feet across, making it the largest auditorium in Moldova. Circus artists would travel from near and far (Belarus, China, Finland, Germany, Russia, Ukraine etc.) to perform there, and at its peak, 57 concerts were held there in the space of a year. The Moldovan independence and the introduction of a market economy initially led to a rapid inflation resulting in a serious economic crisis. Still, today, Moldova is the poorest country in Europe, even though the economy has recovered and is growing steadily. Under these circumstances there was no room for a circus and the venue was abandoned in 2004. Luckily, a decade later, on the 30th of May, 2014, Circul came back to life. A long restoration process funded mainly by the Ministry of Culture had been going on for years and finally a smaller venue was opened in the building. There’s now room for 300 people sitting in the round, and features shows including clowns, gymnasts, acrobats, and exotic animals in classic circus fashion. After being forgotten for a decade the Chişinău State Circus is once again slowly waking to life, restoring its past glory and bringing joy and entertainment to a new generation of Moldovans."
