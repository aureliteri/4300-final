0,Spreepark,"Berlin, Germany","An eerie, derelict amusement park in Berlin.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/spreepark,"The Spreepark in southeastern Berlin has been abandoned since 2002, and it looks like it. Each part of the park is scattered with remnants from the previous three decades, making a hodgepodge of bizarre entertainment, children’s rides, and life-size dinosaur statues. Originally constructed by the socialist government of East Germany in 1969 as the VEB Kulturpark Plänterwald, the “Kulti” stood until the fall of the Berlin Wall 20 years later. It thrived throughout the communist era with 1.7 million visitors annually. The controversial amusement park operator Norbert Witte took it over in 1991, renaming the park “Spreepark.” He replaced the primarily asphalted surface with a grass and water landscape and installed a number of rides which he bought from the insolvency of the Mirapolis amusement park near Paris and moved to Berlin. Witte changed the scenery multiple times, even adding an English village. Unbeknownst to police and Berliners, Witte had also become involved in smuggling cocaine, concealing it in pieces of ride equipment shipped between Peru and Germany during his time as park administrator. Due partly to his criminal activities and due partly to lackluster visitor numbers, Spreepark was shut down to the public in 2002, and Witte was tried on smuggling charges two years later. The result of this shutdown was the amusement park which has slowly fallen into dereliction and has been taken over by nature. The whole park was featured in the film “Hanna,” and the main sites are prominent in the film’s climax. A number of features were destroyed in a fire in 2014 which was caused by arson, following which security was strengthened with a new perimeter fence and permanent security personnel and dogs.  In 2016 the site was taken over by the company Grün Berlin GmbH, owned by the City of Berlin, with the objective of transforming the site into a location for arts and culture.  Plans were proposed in late 2018 and are being considered for implementation in several years. As of May 2019, many of the previous attractions of the park have been removed.  However, the Ferris wheel and the “Fresswürfel” restaurant from the “Kulti” period remain, as do the “Spreeblitz” rollercoaster, the “Cinema 2000,” the facade of the English village, the cup carousel, and the artificial rock of the “Grand Canyon” wild water ride from Norbert Witte’s Spreepark period.  Tours are offered on weekends through August by the city for five euros. Tickets can be purchased on Ticketscript by going through the Grün Berlin website. (this website link is not working anymore) The park is accessible from Berlin city center via S-Bahn (S8 or S9) to Plänterwald station."
1,Rakotzbrücke Devil's Bridge,"Gablenz, Germany",This jaw-dropping 19th-century bridge uses its reflection to form what appears to be a perfect circle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rakotzbrucke-devils-bridge,"Nestled among the verdant foliage in Kromlau, Germany’s Kromlauer Park, is a delicately arched devil’s bridge known as the Rakotzbrücke, which was specifically built to create a circle when it is reflected in the waters beneath it. Commissioned in 1860 by the knight of the local town, the thin arch stretching over the waters of the Rakotzsee is roughly built out of varied local stone. Like many similarly precarious spans across Europe, the Rakotzbrücke is known as a “devil’s bridge,” due to the colloquialism that such bridges were so dangerous or miraculous that they must have been built by Satan. While the bridge (as with all the others) was created by mortal hands, its builders did seem to hold the aesthetics of the bridge in higher regard than its utility. Either end of the Rakotzbrücke is decorated with thin rock spires created to look like natural basalt columns, which occur in many places in Germany. In addition, the curvature of the bridge is designed to be one half of a perfect circle, so that when the waters are still and the light is right, it creates the illusion of a complete stone circle. Today, the bridge can still be viewed in the park, but crossing the aging relic is prohibited in order to preserve it. Update as of August 2019: the bridge is under construction and the lake has been drained. Update as of May 2021: the construction works are finished as of May 21st, 2021  The bridge is best visited during the fall when the foliage adds an element of wonder to the already surreal view. This bridge is located in Kromlauer Park in Eastern Germany and is best accessed by driving. While viewing the bridge is welcome, crossing the bridge is strictly prohibited. As of June 2018, the bridge was reported as being under renovation."
2,Berliner Unterwelten (Subterranean Berlin),"Berlin, Germany",A tour of underground Berlin takes you through WWII air raid shelters and tunnels used to smuggle people out of East Germany.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/berliner-unterwelten-subterranean-berlin,"It’s a strange feeling to come into a dark, half-blasted bunker, see parts of stairways and cables hanging out of the wall and walk through rubble in between holes that go several meters down into the ground. It’s eye-opening to crouch down in an air raid bunker and experience how it must have felt when the situation was for real. These are just a couple of examples of the unique experiences offered at Berliner Unterwelten (Subterranean Berlin). The museum offers tours of some of Berlin’s most important underground structures, such as bunkers, abandoned subway stations, air raid shelters dating back to World War II and tunnels for smuggling people out of East Germany during the Cold War. Berliner Unterwelten was founded in 1997 to explore, document and preserve the city’s subterranean architecture. The organization’s base is in a former air raid bunker in the Gesundbrunnen subway station, now a museum—the Unterwelten Museum (Subterranean Museum)—that offers various tours through Berlin’s underground.  The bunker was cleared and reconstructed by the group and transformed into a museum while maintaining its original character. Hiding on four floors below Berlin are dozens of bunkers, tunnels, walkways, canals, the route of a pneumatic postal system, storage rooms, bomb and ammunition storage, and abandoned subway stations. Berlin, so full of history above ground, has a lot to tell in its subterranean areas as well. There are exhibits about everything from air raid bunkers to the removal of rubble from the destruction during World War II. Berliner Unterwelten found a huge file system about slave workers during the war in a forgotten bunker, helped the former workers to receive reparation pay and have an exhibition about slave workers in Berlin. Found objects such as ammunition, grenades, gas masks, etc. are on display as well. There is an exhibition about Hitler’s “Germania,” his utopian vision to rebuild Berlin. (The exhibition shows that the project was not, of course, a utopia after all.) Berliner Unterwelten also works to preserve subterranean areas. They have dug and cleared out many locations, including half-destroyed bunkers, and opened them to the public. Several different tours are offered, including underground bunker hospitals, mother-and-child bunkers, flak bunkers, subterranean factories, examples of subterranean escape routes from East to West Berlin, flak towers, an underground prison, Cold War bunkers for nuclear war and a tour through the Schwerbelastungskörper, a heavy tower built to test the possibilities of erecting Germania on the sandy ground of Berlin.  Berlin Underworlds tickets must be purchased in advance and in person. Tickets ordered online can be paid using credit cards. Several different tours are offered almost every day of the year as well. For more information about this, check the website of the association, which is available in many languages. Most of the exhibitions and tours are not barrier-free and also not offered to small children. The best thing is to call and ask, when you have decided on a visit or tour. Most tours cannot be booked online. The tickets have to be bought on the day the tour is offered. Tours are booked out fast. If you decide on a tour it would be best to be at their ticket office about one hour before they open and get in line.Special tours of other subjects are offered throughout the year. All the tours are offered in several different languages."
3,Monster Kabinett,"Berlin, Germany","Part art gallery, part haunted house, this robotic art display is a terrifying experience.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monster-kabinett,"The Monster Kabinett is a wonderland (so to speak) of massive robotic creatures, clanking metal sculptures and insect-like beasts. In short, it lives up to its unsettling name. Created and maintained by an art collective known as the Dead Pigeon Collective, the Monster Kabinett is a warehouse full of strange art and costumed revelers, all waiting to put on a show each Thursday and Friday night. Good luck trying to figure out which creations are human and which are simply moving metal masterpieces. Visitors are confronted with the stuff of nightmares, from skittering arachnoid robots to leering, malformed sculptures to aggressive actors straight out of a haunted house. Except this haunting is year-round. The journey to the Monster Kabinett is a fitting one as well, down a dank alley off of a bustling city street. Most patrons are unsure of whether they’ve reached the right location until they’re directly in front of it, often greeted by a good-natured but somewhat off-key member of the collective. The gallery is safe, of course, but built to instill and inspire as much fright and dread as possible. And rest assured, the Dead Pigeon Collective does that part very well. The Monster Kabinett better seen than heard, which is why their website is built as more of a tour than a repository of dry information. And really, what information about the gallery is necessary? It’s best left a mystery until you experience it first-hand. Update June 2018: The museum/collection is open Wednesdays through Saturdays with hourly tours."
4,Liquidrom,"Berlin, Germany",This futuristic German spa allows visitors to float in a pool of salt water while zoning out to underwater techno.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/liquidrom,"Resembling a surreal crown, the exterior of the Tempodrom, where the Liquidrom spa is located, looks like something straight out of a science fiction novel. The hi-tech delights within don’t disappoint either. The complex is built to look like an abstract tent structure, the site once served as a massive train station circa World War II, where buskers would perform where they pleased. Inside the ultra-modern structure, any remnant of those locomotive days are gone, however, they have been replaced with top of the line spa facilities made of clean lines and comfortable contours. The Liquidrom is outfitted with a variety of saunas and baths, as well as clean, new changing facilities. However, all of these standard relaxation options pale in comparison to the crown jewel of the spa’s crown, the large saltwater floating pool. Surrounded by large arches, the dimly lit pool is brought to life by multi-colored lights and music that is meant to be heard under the water. From classical to techno, the music and lights run different programs that can be checked on the website. While the goal of the pool is to promote relaxation, the overall effect looks like something straight out of dreamscape."
5,Berlin Botanical Garden,"Berlin, Germany","Started as a kitchen garden, now the second largest botanical garden in the world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/berlin-botanical-garden,"Established as a kitchen garden in 1679, the Botanical Garden in Berlin is the second largest botanical garden in the world, second only to Kew Gardens, located in England. The garden evolved from a kitchen garden growing vegetables and hops for beer brewing to a “considerable plant assemblage,” and in 1879 the Royal Botanical Museum was founded, encompassing every area of botany. The sheer size of the gardens and the lush density of the plant life is overwhelming, especially when taking into account that so many of these plants are endangered in their natural habitats. What grows strong and vibrant in this collection is often threatened with extinction elsewhere. This assembly of gardens, sixteen greenhouses, and landscapes exhibit a microcosm of nature’s diversity, home to flowering vines, rock cliff waterfalls, timber bamboo reaching to the sky, and a carpet of ferns, orchids, and bromeliads at your feet. The Victoria House delivers a proper tropical environment with sweltering humidity that the orchids and lilies love, a bamboo bridge that transports you over the basin and into an exotic plant paradise. With 43 hectares and close to 22,000 plant species, one visit won’t even come close to allowing you to see everything. Make sure you make the most of your day there and don’t miss the Great Pavillion, which at 20 meters high and 30x60 meters in floor area is the largest glasshouse in the world. Other must-see displays include the giant water lilies, carnivorous plant specimens, and a small cemetery, located to the left of the greenhouse complex when coming from access at the Königin-Luise-Platz. Keep a lookout for the sarcophagus of Friedrich Althoff, a university tutor deceased in 1908, which consists of a dolorous female figure meant to represent science in mourning. Also of interest, but currently not open to the public (or anyone for that matter) is a series of tunnels built near the Botanical Gardens in WWII. Entrance to the bunker was through two tunnels leading from the farm of the botanical garden. Built for the SS to house personnel and files during air raids, after the war the entrances were blown up, and the tunnels now serve as a winter roost for bats."
6,Neuschwanstein Castle,"Schwangau, Germany","The fairy tale castle of the ""fairy-tale king.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/neuschwanstein-castle,"Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland, Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom and numerous other magical castles were all inspired by a real castle: Neuschwanstein Castle, the awe-inspiring retreat of the “fairy-tale king,” Ludwig II of Bavaria. Commissioned by the king in homage to Richard Wagner, the fantastical castle was designed by theatrical set designer Christian Jank. The beautiful design was to further enhance the already romantic mountain and forest scenery. The first stone of Neuschwanstein Castle (which literally means, “New Swan Stone palace”) was laid in September 1869. The technology used to build this castle was considered modern and advanced. New inventions such as electricity, plumbing, heat and steamboats were used in the construction of the castle, and Ludwig himself was considered responsible for the introduction of many of these inventions to the area. In 1886, as the massively expensive castle neared completion, the State Commissioner pronounced Ludwig insane and arrested him soon after. The day after he was arrested, Ludwig requested the Commissioner go on a walk in the woods with him. The commissioner agreed and told his guards to stay behind. Both were found mysteriously dead in a lake later that evening. Ludwig was never able to see the finalized castle—and it didn’t receive its name until after his death—but his taste for elegant, and extravagant, design resonates throughout the interior of the Romanesque-style castle. After his death, the castle was opened for the public to help pay off the expenses. During World War II, the castle was appropriated and used by German forces as a depot to store all of the plundered art from France and other Nazi-occupied countries in Europe. At the close of the war, the Nazis contemplated blowing the castle up with explosives to prevent the encroaching allied forces from discovering the scale of their art looting. However, fortunately, the plan was never implemented. Today, the castle is one of the biggest attractions in Bavaria and manages to draw well over a million people a year. Of particular delight is the Grotto Room, an artificial cave complete with stalactites and a waterfall; it was intended to represent a cave from Wagner’s opera “Tannhauser.” Ironically, Wagner never stepped foot in the castle.  Most people take the train from Munich; once you arrive at the station, a bus or taxi can be taken to Hohenschwangau where the castle's ticketing office is located. You're given a block of time for your tour, so you may need to kill some time first in the small town at the base of the castle. From there, you can either hike to the top or pay for a horse-drawn carriage ride up the mountain. If you plan on doing the former, comfortable footwear is recommended. Because of it's popularity, it is strongly advised that you purchase your tickets in advanced, especially if you are short on time or visiting during high season. Luggage, large rucksacks, and strollers are not allowed. There are some lockers at the castle, but storing these items prior to your visit is recommended. The castle does provide services for persons with limited mobility. You can find all the necessary information by visiting the website."
7,Tajikistan Tearoom,"Berlin, Germany",A slice of central Asia in the middle of Berlin.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tajikistan-tearoom,"Tajikistan tearoom is an unexpected slice of central Asia in the midst of Berlin. The tearoom was built as a Tajikistan pavilion at one of the Leipzig trade fairs in the 1970s. After the trade fair ended, the pavilion was donated by the Soviet Republic of Tajikistan to their East German hosts. The tearoom’s lush interior is decorated entirely in a classical Persian style, with carved wooden pillars and thick Persian carpets. Tea and food are served on low wooden tables which are typical of central Asia. Guests sit on the floor, stretched out on comfortable cushions, and visitors are required to take their shoes off before stepping onto the carpet. Like the country for which it was named, the Tajikistan tearoom is a place where Persian and Russian cultures mix. An old map of Soviet tourist resorts hangs above the counter. And while the selection of tea is oriental, the food on offer is Russian, and a silver Russian samovar - a metal container used for heating water - sits in one corner. The pavilion once lived inside Berlin’s Palais am Festungsgraben, but has since moved to a new home in the KunstHof, a courtyard lined with galleries and cafes. Still somewhat hidden from most tourists — the Tajikistan tearoom is an excellent place to get refreshed in the Russian summer.  Is almost opposite to the Arthouse Tacheles, hidden on the left in the courtyard (im KunstHof). phone: +49 (030) 204 11 12"
8,Pergamon Museum,"Berlin, Germany","The most visited, and possibly most controversial, museum in Germany.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pergamon-museum,"Situated on Berlin’s Museum Island, the Pergamon Museum houses original, reconstructed monumental buildings such as the Pergamon Altar and the Market Gate of Miletus. Both of these extraordinary artifacts were transported from Turkey, and since its opening in 1930, there has been controversy over the legitimacy of the acquisition of the collection. Many have suggested that the collection be returned to Turkey. When the Pergamon Museum was severely damaged during an air strike at the end of the Second World War, many objects were stolen. Although many of the major pieces were safely secured, the Red Army collected all of the loose museum items, either as war booty or for safe keeping from the looting and fires that were then raging in Berlin. In 1958, most of the objects returned to East Germany, but a few significant items of the collection simply remained in Russia. Many of them are now housed in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow and the Hermitage in Saint Petersburg. While Germany is debating whether these artifacts should be returned, Russia currently has no plans to return their items to Turkey, or back to Germany."
9,Castle Frankenstein,"Mühltal, Germany",The birthplace of an eccentric alchemist and possible inspiration for the fictional reanimator of monsters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castle-frankenstein,"Johann Konrad Dippel was rumored to create potions, perform electrical therapies, and partake in gruesome experiments involving stolen body parts from the graveyard. Born in the Castle Frankenstein (German: Burg Frankenstein) in 1673, it’s disputed whether or not he was the inspiration for Mary Shelley’s mad scientist of the same name, who did some cadaver experiments of his own. What is sure about Dippel is his colorful career as an alchemist. He attached his name to Dippel’s Animal Oil, which he discovered from the destructive distillation of animal parts and claimed as a universal medicine. The animal oil came at the end of a wave of popularity for Iatrochemistry, which had moved alchemy from the search for creating gold to finding new medicines. The unpleasant taste and smell, as well as the progression of medicine, made Dippel’s oil fall into disrepute by the end of the 18th-century. Dippel later helped set up a laboratory in Berlin for making gold and, at one point, he ended up in prison on a Danish island for seven years due to political activities. In 1734, he finally had a stroke and died at Castle Wittgenstein near Berleburg, although his friends claimed he was poisoned. By his own hand or that of another, it is unclear. The Castle Frankenstein is now in ruins, with only two towers, a restaurant with a vegan and kid-friendly menu, and a chapel remaining. However, the perhaps mythical connection to Mary Shelley’s novel “Frankenstein” keeps it a popular destination, especially for Halloween. In late October and early November, the Burg Frankenstein Halloween party gathers zombies, witches, werewolves, vampires, and regular visitors for scary dinners and creepy shows. A popular annual party was started there by American soldiers stationed near the castle in World War II. Until it was deactivated in 2008, the US Army’s 233rd Base Support Battalion in Darmstadt conducted an annual Frankenstein Castle run which finished at the tower. The castle was featured in an episode of Ghost Hunters International, which aired in February of 2008. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about Castle Frankenstein.  Leave Autobahn A5 at Pfungstadt Eberstadt and follow the castle signs."
10,Design Panoptikum,"Berlin, Germany",A surreal museum of extraordinary industrial objects.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/design-panoptikum,"A step through the doors of Design Panoptikum, a Museum of Extraordinary Objects, is a step into a wonderfully unnerving world of retro-tech attached to body parts, and medical equipment paired with common items from eras spanning past and future. Troubling imagery coupled with a self-described “space carnival atmosphere” lends to a spooky yet whimsical world of doll-like mechanical monsters and a place where people seem to have been put together with spare parts. Lounging on rare furniture under a substantial collection of bizarre lamps, these eerie figures and their surrounding furnishings are designed from historical objects from aviation, the medical field, the film industry and more. Owner Vlad will, if you’re lucky, give you a personal tour of his half design museum, half horror house of imagination."
11,Stasi Museum,"Berlin, Germany",A museum dedicated to the history of a terrifying secret police is now held in their former headquarters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stasi-museum,"An inside look at the operations of one of the most feared secret police states of the 20th century. The Stasi was the GDR’s infamous secret police force. Considering itself the “shield and sword of the party” it ran a covert war against perceived enemies of the state. It was from this building that head of the Stasi, Erich Mielke, ran one of the most feared secret police forces the world has ever known. It’s estimated that one out of every 10 East Germans worked as an informant for the Stasi, and the museum shows many of the bizarre ways the totalitarian regime used to spy on its citizens. Microphones hidden inside church hymn books, wrist watches with wire taps that ran up your sleeve, one of the most peculiar methods even involved the use of sniffer dogs. This latter method involved hiding cotton squares under seat cushions, then after the suspect left their seat, the cotton square was removed from the seat and placed in an airtight jar. Dogs could then be used to track that person based on the scent they left behind. There is a special section of the museum, on the 3rd floor, dedicated to the Stasi technique of “Zersetzung” (corrosion)—the East German secret police method of dealing with problematic political dissidents by, for example, ruining their marriages, delivering pornographic material to their homes, and routinely deflating the tires on their bicycles. All in order to drive their victims to the end of their wits. The museum also highlights the Orwellian brainwashing that took place at school level; instead of cutout dolls with fashionable clothes, children of the GDR had cutout dolls with gas masks and AK-47s. Flash cards used to teach A, B, C’s featured lock picking, fingerprint taking, and camera surveillance. Look out for the painting at the head of the conference room, depicting the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, produced by the same artist (the unfortunately named Dr Frankenstein) responsible for the series of abstract political images adorning the walls of the nearby Magdalenenstrasse U-bahn. Today the odd methods the Stasi used to employ, waver between the amusing and the downright strange. But for the common people living behind the Iron Curtain, they were a ruthless, all-seeing force, the mention of which would send shivers down spines. U-bahn 5, station Magdalenenstr."
12,Haus Schwarzenberg Street Art Alley,"Berlin, Germany","A narrow passage next to a cafe leads to a courtyard exploding with murals, tags, and paste-ups.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/haus-schwarzenberg-street-art-alley,"On the north side of Berlin’s famous Hackescher Markt stands the entrance to the Hackeschen Höfe, a series of interconnected art nouveau courtyards featuring shopping, entertainment, and dining. Just a bit farther up the street, however, another courtyard is hidden away all on its own. Lacking a grand entryway, it can be easy to miss, but through its humble portal lies a hot spot of Berlin street art. Since street art is mercurial and chaotic by its very nature, the art on display in the alley next to Haus Schwarzenberg changes on an almost weekly basis, with new pieces being painted on, papered over, added to, and repurposed in the constantly evolving collage that washes over this little urban oasis. Famous street artists like El Bocho, Miss Van, Stinkfish, Otto Schade, and more have been known to add to the churn. The alley also features a famous painting of Anne Frank by Jimmy C that remains intact and untouched. The existence of this vibrant cultural pocket is thanks chiefly to Haus Schwarzenberg, a non-profit arts organization that occupies the building adjoining the alley. Even more artwork can be found in the stairwells and shops located in the building, so be sure to have a peek inside the doors leading off of the courtyard while you’re there.  The entrance is a narrow alley just to the right of the Cafe Cinema."
13,Eltz Castle - Burg Eltz,"Wierschem, Germany",This medieval castle overlooking the Elzbach river looks just like it did hundreds of years ago.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castle-eltz-burg-eltz,"One of only three castles in the region left intact over the centuries, Burg Eltz (Eltz Castle) has remained in the same family for over 850 years, or 33 generations. Though the Eltz family first moved into the castle in the 12th century, they continued making renovations and additions for centuries. As such, it wasn’t completed until between 1490 and 1540. The 80-room castle is still occupied today, and looks much as it would have hundreds of years ago. Local stories say that it is infested with the ghosts of medieval knights. The castle is one of the few in the area that survived the Thirty Years’ War. The French did not destroy the castle thanks to its location, and some skilled diplomacy on the part of the landowners.  Located between Koblenz and Cochem, near the Mosel River in the Eltztal. Go early in the morning to avoid crowds. There are two routes down to the castle, one is a hiking trail and the other is a well-trod tourist trail. The parking and start point for each are on opposite sides of the valley. Open April to November."
14,The Bastei,"Lohmen, Germany",Ruins of a German Castle on top of a towering stone pillar.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bastei,"Rising up from the Elbe River Valley, Saxon Switzerland contains some of Germany’s most spectacular scenery - a maze of sandstone pillars, pristine forest, and intimidating fortresses. One of these was the Felsenburg Neurathen - built in the 11th Century, it dominated the landscape for 3 centuries until burned by a besieging army in 1484. Sadly there is little left of the Felsenburg Neurathen that once sat on top of the natural stone towers. Today, it is possible to visit the ruins, but what’s more spectacular is the view that the site commands. The surrounding area is so scenic that it was the site of Germany’s first landscape photography, and by 1850 the original wooden bridge had been replaced by a permanent one made of sandstone in order to accommodate the increasing tourist traffic. From the Bastei, you can look out into a wide valley where sandstone mesas rise up from the forest floor and the site itself is a gateway to various hikes throughout the park region. The region around the Bastei is also popular with rock climbers, and there are numerous free-climbing options. Take the S1 from Dresden in the direction of Bad Schandau and exit the train at the town of Rathen. Cross the river using the ferry and follow the well-marked trail to the Bastei."
15,Museum of Unheard of Things,"Berlin, Germany",A wunderkammer of mysterious objects and stories.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-unheard-of-things,"Berlin seems to be fascinated with the examination of “things.” The Museum der Dinge, a collection of everyday items devoted to modern object design, and the Design Panoptikum, a surreal museum of extraordinary industrial objects, are a couple examples. This beloved curio collection of “Unheard of Things” is further proof. The Museum of Unheard of Things is a wunderkammer of curious and evocative items. The objects in the collection are all arranged by their weight, and plastered all over the museum walls. The items themselves are not the entirely the point, though—what’s really on display is the power of imagination, for an “unheard of” story has been invented about each exhibit by the raconteur curator. Each seemingly simple object inspires a tall tale or urban myth, told in a dry and convincing way by its label - so convincing, in fact, that some museum visitors leave in awe of the “petrified water” they have seen. Read the tale of the petrified potatoes, the story behind the fur of a Bonsai deer, or the cow-pie worshipping community, or how sacramental wine lost its red color. These are just some of the myths you can learn in this unique exhibition. Located in an East Germany factory building, the museum is curated by artist Roland Albrecht, who also has a book by the same name. The idea behind both is to encourage people to pause and reassess their world view, to think about the bigger story behind the everyday things we take for granted, and to view the world through the lens of imagination."
16,The Oracle of Delphi,Greece,The hallucinogenic center of the ancient world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-oracle-of-delphi-greece,"For ancient Greeks, Delphi was the center of the world: a site sacred to the god Apollo, where all Greeks united to worship. But at its heart was a dark, strange place: the mysterious sanctuary where the priestess of Apollo prophesied. The priestess, called the Pythia, sat above a chasm in the earth, which belched forth fumes. She breathed deeply – some believe that the fumes possessed hallucinogenic properties - and slipped into semi-consciousness. Her prophecies were opaque, often frantic. This was the Oracle of Delphi: the Greeks’ most famous and most feared window into the will of the gods. It lay in “a cavern hollowed down in the depths” of the hillside, as the historian Strabo reported, underneath the great Temple of Apollo. Today, the ruins of the Temple sit on the slopes of Mount Parnassus. It was destroyed by the Emperor Theodosius I, in 390 CE, in an attempt to eradicate the old pagan beliefs. Few traces of the Oracle remain, but the site is still an eerie one: mist clings to the hills, and you can almost hear the ghosts of Croesus, Nero, and Alexander."
17,Meteora,"Kalabaka, Greece","Monasteries on rock pillars, once accessible only by frayed ropes.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/meteora,"The Orthodox church has always had a knack for picking spectacular locations for its sacred buildings, and Meteora is no exception. Even if it weren’t the location of the second most important monastery complex in Greece, Meteora would still be a site worthy of awe. In the foothills of the Pindus mountains, above the central Greek plains of Thessaly, is a series of geological wonders that stick out from the ground. The name Meteora means “suspended in the air” or “suspended rocks” and it is appropriate. Wind, water, and the harsh temperatures have carved out a series of gigantic sandstone pillars, some of them hundreds of meters high. The first hermit monks appeared in this area as early as the 11th century, however the monastery complex only began to flourish after the Ottoman conquest of Byzantine empire in 1453. Due to persecution and concern about the Ottomans, orthodox monks sought refuge in increasingly remote locations. What better place to establish a monastery then in, as Meteora is sometimes translated, “the heavens above”? To gain access to the monastery one originally had to climb a series of ladders tied together or be dragged up via a large net. According to the monks the ropes up to Meteora were only replaced “when the Lord let them break.” Today steps have been carved into the rock and a bridge built from a nearby plateau. At its peak the complex included 20 monasteries, however only six of them remain today; five are for men only, and the sixth for women. Great Meteora is the largest and most often visited by tourists. Roussanou is located on a relatively smaller rock, and this makes it an excellent point for spectacular photos of the Varlaam monastery and of the Metamorfosis church.  Each monastery has slightly different open hours so some planning up ahead is needed if one intends to visit all 6 monasteries. Proper attire is required, skirts below the knee length for women and long pants for men."
18,Sami,Greece,A spectacular cave and a beguiling lake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sami,"Sami, located on the Greek island of Kefolonia (sometimes spelt Cephalonia) boasts two magnificent geological oddities: Drogarati Cave and Melissani Lake. The short distance between the two allows tourists to visit both of these natural wonders in one day. Lake Melissani was given its name after archaeological excavations in 1951 and 1962 revealed Minoan depictions of the nymph Melissanthi and the god Pan. The lake itself was created many years ago when a huge underground cavern collapsed, leaving a large circular opening to the surface. Between 11am and 1pm on sunny days, Lake Melissani is an otherworldly blue. Three hundred years ago, the Drogarati Cave was discovered after an earthquake opened up a previously closed entrance, but it was not until 1963 that the cave was opened to the public. Those who have been fortunate enough to visit are treated to its beautiful stalagmites and stalactites. The largest room in the cave, “Sala of Apotheosis,” is 900 meters square and illuminated. It is often used for concerts because of its outstanding acoustics. The published coordinates will take you to the Melissani Lake. The most stunning of the two attractions on the island. If you want the Drogarati Caves, punch 38.227121°, 20.628339° into your GPS. Don't get it wet here though!"
19,Navagio Beach,"Zakinthos, Greece",Hidden in a secluded Greek cove is a pristine beach marred only by the rusting smuggler's hulk stranded on its shores.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/navagio-beach,"The island of Zakynthos is a jagged little piece of land off the southwest coast of Greece that features a number of rocky coves cut off from the mainland. In one of these secluded bits of paradise is Navagio Beach, a sandy little strip that would be remarkable for its beauty, but is made more so by the crumbling remains of a smuggler’s shipwreck. Also known as “Shipwreck Beach” and “Smuggler’s Cove,” the beach became a mini ship graveyard in 1983 when the shipping vessel known as the Panagiotis crashed on the scenic shore in Zakynthos Greece. According to reports, the ship was smuggling cigarettes, booze, and maybe even humans when the authorities caught onto the trail and chased it through bad weather, right into the cove, where it ran aground. Ever since the crash, the hulk has sat on the shore slowly falling apart. The crash site soon became a popular destination for vacationers looking not only for an untouched beach but called by the siren song of the decaying ship. As the bulkhead of the ship rust away the hull seems to be sinking into the sands, but most of the vessel still sits on the beach. Today, the beach is still a popular site for people looking to get off the beaten path, although the path is often beaten by hundreds of others at peak times. The beach was prominently featured in the Descendants of the Sun Korean drama, which led to a surge of interest among Korean and Chinese tourists.  The ship is only accessible from sea, and most tour operators on the island run day trips. Some tours run only in high season from April to October. The best time to visit the beach is early morning before the hordes of tourists spoil the landscape."
20,Antikythera Mechanism,"Athens, Greece",2000-year-old computer demonstrates remarkable engineering and astronomical precision.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/antikythera-mechanism,"For over 2,000 years, a shipwreck lay off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera, its hidden treasures slowly corroded by the Mediterranean. It wasn’t until 1900 that sponge divers happened upon the loot, and found therein a perplexing device of remarkable engineering - though the divers had no idea how truly remarkable it was at the time. The device sat in a museum for fifty years before historians began to take a serious look at it. Known as the Antikythera mechanism and called a “clockwork computer,” this small bronze instrument is unique because it precedes any machine of comparable complexity by more than a millennium. The mechanism was built circa 200 BC, and, with over thirty gears hidden behind its dials, it is easily the most advanced technological artifact of the pre-Christian period. Regarded as the first known analog computer, the mechanism can make precise calculations based on astronomical and mathematical principles developed by the ancient Greeks. Although its builder’s identity and what it was doing aboard a ship remain mysteries, scientists have worked for a century to piece together the mechanism’s history. Somewhat surprisingly, most consider it unlikely that the Antikythera mechanism was a navigational tool. The harsh environment at sea would have presented a danger to the instrument’s delicate gears, and features such as eclipse predictions are unnecessary for navigation. The mechanism’s small size, however, does suggest that it was designed with portability in mind. According to some researchers, a more plausible story is that the mechanism was used to teach astronomy to those with little knowledge of the subject. To use the instrument, you would simply enter a date using a crank, and, when the gears stopped spinning, a wealth of information appear at your fingertips: the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, the lunar phase, the dates of upcoming solar eclipses, the speed of the Moon through the sky, and even the dates of the Olympic games. Perhaps most impressively, the mechanism’s calendar dial could compensate for the extra quarter-day in the astronomical year by turning the scale back one day every four years. The Julian calendar, which was the first in the region to include leap years, was not introduced until decades after the instrument was built. While the Antikythera mechanism is the only known artifact of its kind, its precise engineering and the fact that similar instruments were described in contemporary writing lend strong support to the notion that it was not unique. It is thought that the famous inventor Archimedes of Syracuse constructed comparable devices. Some believe that the instrument came from the school of the astronomer Hipparchus. Whoever the builder was, they were likely Greek, as evidenced by the written instructions that are attached to the instrument’s face. Today, the Antikythera mechanism is housed is in the Bronze Collection of the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. A replica of the mechanism is also on view at the American Computer Museum in Bozeman, Montana. When Jacques-Yves Cousteau made his last visit to the shipwreck in 1978, he found no additional pieces. Nevertheless, the device continues to reveal its secrets to the researchers of the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project, an international effort supported by various universities and technology companies."
21,Tourlitis Lighthouse,"Andros, Greece","Perched on a spindly rock spire in a Greek archipelago, this lighthouse would make a perfect wizard's tower.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tourlitis-lighthouse,"As lighthouses go, you can’t get much more evocative than the Tourlitis Lighthouse off the coast of the Greek port city of Andros. Rising up out of a weather-worn stone spire, the beacon looks like something straight out of a fantasy novel. The lighthouse was first built in 1897 just off shore from a castle in Andros. The stone column on which it was built had been shaped by millennia of natural erosion into the perfect pedestal for a coastal beacon. Unfortunately the original lighthouse was not long for this world, and was destroyed during World War II. For a time, the rocky outcropping went without a proper lighthouse, and the fantastical image created by the former structure was all but lost. However, the lovely beacon apparently had an extra life. The lighthouse was eventually rebuilt in the early 1990s by an oil tycoon who dedicated the structure to his daughter. The replica became Greece’s first automated lighthouse, eliminating the need for an onsite keeper to operate the light. But even with the modern upgrade, the lighthouse still looks like something out of Dungeon and Dragons, with the winding staircase hewn from the rock itself, leading up to the door of the tower. Since its renovation, it has become one of the area’s foremost tourist attractions, drawing lighthouse peepers and photographers who come to gawk at its singular beauty."
22,The Athenian Agora,"Athens, Greece",This ancient Greek place of assembly and marketplace is being revealed layer by layer below the modern Athens cityscape.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-athenian-agora-athens-greece,"Lying right beneath the northern slope of the Acropolis is the ancient Athenian Agora. Walking through the Agora takes the visitor back through the place where Athens’s mighty heart once beat. Literally meaning “marketplace,” the Agora was the economic center, where the wealth, reach and influence of classical Athens was visible by the wide range of goods shipped in from the nearby port of Piraeus, which ranged from wheat produced on the shores of the Black Sea to precious dyes from the Levant. But what marked the Agora with everlasting glory was the other commodity traded and peddled daily: ideas. The Agora was the meeting grounds and hang out spot for ancient Athenians, where members of the elected democracy assembled to discuss affairs of state, noblemen came to conduct business, ordinary citizens got together to meet up with friends and watch performers, and where the famed philosophers doused their listeners with wisdom (or rubbish). The Agora also played serious a role in religious festivals. The architectural layout of the Agora was centered around the Panathenaic Way, a road the ran through the heart of Athens to the main gate of the city, the Dipylon. The road was sacred, serving as the travel route for the Panathenaic festival, held in honor of the city’s patron goddess Athena every four years. The Agora was also home to the Temple of Hephaestus, the Greek god of craftsmen and metalworking. It was thought for many years to be a temple dedicated to Theseus, the founding mythological hero of Athens, but this turned out to be wrong. The temple is still visible in great condition, and is one of the best-preserved classical temples in all of Greece. Other temples formerly standing at the Agora include temples dedicated to Zeus, Athena, Apollo, and Ares. Notable buildings include the city’s arsenal, the Tholos (where the city’s elected generals lived on the public’s dime) and the numerous stoas- Stoa Baileios, Stoa Poikile, and the Stoa of Attalos to name a few. Stoas were massive covered porticos designed for public usage, where merchants could sell their goods and where people could catch some shade on a scorching summer day. The Stoa of Attalos was rebuilt in the 1950’s and houses both the Agora Museum and the storage and conservation facilities of the Agora’s ongoing archaeological excavation. Most of what’s visible and known of the Athenian Agora was a mystery until excavations by the American School in Athens began in 1934. Much of the site was actually covered by a refugee camp made up of Greeks who fled Turkey during the events following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The excavations uncovered most of the 30+ known major buildings from the ancient Athenian Agora, along with thousands of artifacts. Conservation efforts have restored thousands of pieces of pottery and amphora (the standard storage vessel of the ancient world), studied thousands of marble statues and reliefs, and analyzed the remains of human and animal bones to give us a better understanding of what life was like in the ancient Athenian world. The excavation is ongoing, with a digging team made up of highly qualified students of classics, archaeology, and occasionally economics or oceanography present every summer to get their Indiana Jones on, most of which involves constant squatting in the hot Greek sun, pickaxing through layers of never-ending dirt, and sweeping all of the dirt and rocks away to reveal pottery, walls, bones, coins, but often…more dirt. In the summer of 2010, the excavation tackled the Stoa Poikile, or the Painted Stoa. It was the hang-out spot of people looking to relax and watch fire-eaters, as well as a testament to Athen’s glory days, housing four famous (but now lost) paintings known throughout the ancient world: a battle of Theseus against the Amazons, the siege of Troy, the Battle of Oenoe (Athen’s first major victory over Sparta), and the Battle of Marathon (Athen’s victory that stopped Persian the advancing Persian army). The Painted Stoa was also the meeting place of the philosopher Xeno and his students, and it is from this building that his disciples derived the name “Stoics.” Other sites to see in or around the Athenian Agora include the Church of the Holy Apostles (a Byzantine Church built around 1000 CE), the Roman Agora, the Areopagus (a hill where city affairs were managed prior to the democracy), the Pnyx (a hill where city affairs were managed once it became a democracy), the ancient cemetery at Keameikos, and of course the Acropolis."
23,Mycenae,"Argolis, Greece",This legendary city has been a tourist attraction for centuries.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mycenae,"On a hilltop among hilltops on the Peloponnesian peninsula in Greece, an ancient stillness pervades the poppy-strewn countryside and muffles the bells of nearby sheep with their shepherds. And yet the tour buses continuously rumble up to the ancient stone remnants of a great city. Stone lions gaze upward even as round tombs huddle deeper into the earth. This is Mycenae, once the major power in the Bronze Age and Helladic Greece, controlling most of southern Greece and communicating with other trading centers as far away as Crete and Egypt, but no more than a tourist attraction since Roman times. This is the home of larger than life literary and mythological figures, from the hero Perseus to the bloody dynasty of the house of Atreus. Mycenae was also the kingdom of Agamemnon, who pursued his brother’s wayward bride (and the riches she hid among) to the far shores of Troy. Ill winds at the outset of the Greek army’s journey persuaded the king to sacrifice his own daughter to gain godly favor and precipitated an equally bloody chain of events upon his return home 10 years later. His vengeful wife Clytemnestra and her lover killed Agamemnon in the bath, the writer Aeschylus says in his Oresteia trilogy, which in turn led Agamemnon and Clytemnestra’s son Orestes to seek revenge for his father. When amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, fresh from his excavations at Troy, came to Mycenae in 1874, he began a large, systematic excavation and maintained his zeal for finding evidence of his beloved Homeric epics. Excavations uncovered a plethora of shaft graves, many of which contained a wealth of grave goods, including weapons, jewels, and beaten gold death masks. Despite the date of these tombs being quite a bit earlier than the layer of Troy he believed to be in contact with the Mycenaeans, Schliemann famously said upon finding the golden mask of a particularly serious bearded man, “I have gazed upon the face of Agamemnon.” The mask has retained this moniker and is on view at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, along with other finds from the site. Perhaps the most famous feature of the site is the set of beehive tombs (tholoi). The tholoi marked a transition in burial practices from the earlier shaft graves and, while their grand nature implies the presence of important individuals, their visibility also made them easy prey for looters, and little was found within them. Also of note are the slippery stone steps that lead down into the hillside to the long-filled-in remnants of an ancient cistern. Fed by a spring outside the city walls, the secret cistern gave the Mycenaeans access to water even if the city came under siege. Although Schleimann harbored a romantic hope of finding his beloved Homeric heroes in the remnants of Mycenae, the wealthy residents of the shaft graves predate even the cyclopean walls of Mycenae’s citadel. However, if we allow that the characters in the works of Homer and other poets are not rooted in a concrete timeline, but are echoes of earlier figures and events that were so important that they were passed on through the ages in the collective memory of the ancient Greeks, it is easy to believe that we have gazed upon the face of Agamemnon as well."
24,Knossos,"Heraklion, Greece","A minotaur, a labyrinth, and a dubious restoration pull in visitors from around the world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/knossos-crete,"In northern Crete, near the modern city of Heraklion lies the ruins of Knossos, a city dating back to 7000 B.C. that was once home to a number of famous Greek myths and is now a popular tourist attraction. According to Greek mythology, King Minos built his palace at Knossos. Daedulus, a craftsman and brilliant inventor, built the labyrinth to house Pasiphea’s son, the minotaur, under King Minos’s order. The labyrinth was a huge seemingly never-ending maze located under the court of King Minos. Unfortunately, much of this legend is unverifiable as the Palace of Knossos was destroyed by fire around 1450 BC, and the surrounding town was left deserted and was eventually lost to time. However, after centuries of existing only in myth, thanks to the work of a British archaeologist Knossos was put back on the map. In 1900 Arthur Evans bought several acres of land near Crete, hoping to find evidence of the historical reign of Minos. He began to dig and over the course of 25 years of work he uncovered layer after layer of finds including the ruins of a spectacular palace. Having decided that this was the palace of Minos, he set about restoring it. It is this restoration which visitors (over a million a year) flock to today. As Mary Beard explored in the New York Review of Books, the restored site is more than a little curious. Very few of the sights are original, such as the famous frescoes of Knossos which are (barring a few corners here and there) entirely modern. Much of the exhibit is even outrageously wrong, with Evans himself admitting that he had relied on “educated guesses.” The author Evelyn Waugh, visiting in 1930, remarked of the site, “It is impossible to disregard the suspicion that their painters [of the restored frescoes of Knossos] have tempered their zeal for accurate reconstruction with a somewhat inappropriate predilection for covers of Vogue.” Cathy Gere, the author of a recent study of Knossos, noted that this “ancient” palace in fact “enjoys the dubious distinction of being one of the first reinforced concrete buildings ever erected on the island.’ Knossos is a fine place to wander, though less to glimpse the world of ancient myth and more to see how successive generations reinterpret their own past."
25,Lycabettus Funicular,"Athens, Greece","The railway carts travelers to central Athens's highest peak, which offers stunning vistas of the city.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lycabettus-funicular,"Running from the lower terminus in Kolonaki to the upper terminus atop Mount Lycabettus, the Lycabettus Funicular takes passengers on a 680-foot underground journey up to the highest peak in central Athens. Mount Lycabettus sits 908 feet above sea level. In 1960, construction began on a funicular railway that would take visitors to the top of the mountain. After much digging and hauling, the Lycabettus Funicular was inaugurated on April 18, 1965. The funicular ran uninterrupted for 38 years until 2002, when the carriages were replaced and the mechanical and electrical systems were renovated. Now, each car has a capacity of 34 people and the funicular transports an average of 300,000 riders annually. Atop the mountain is a panoramic view of all of Athens. On the higher peak is the 19th-century Chapel of Saint George, a tiny Cycladic-style chapel that was first used by a Monk in 1834 and sits on the grounds of an ancient temple dedicated to the God Zeus as well as a café and restaurant. On the lower peak sits a 4,000-seat Amphitheater.  The Lycabettus Funicular generally runs daily between 9:30 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. Hours may vary based on seasonal conditions. Two carriages start simultaneously every 30 minutes (more often at peak times) at the opposite terminus and move on a single track that intersects at the midpoint. The length of the journey is 210 meters and a one-way trip lasts three minutes. Those prone to claustrophobia or motion sickness should take the environment into consideration before deciding whether to use the funicular. Guests that wish to visit the chapel must climb several dozen steps to get to the peak where it is located. Dress codes vary from church to church in Greek orthodoxy. If you wish to enter the chapel, a show of respect to the chapel and its members is achieved by modest clothing and proper behavior. For men shorts, tank tops/sleeveless shirts and sandals/flip flops are frowned upon. Women's shoulders should not be shown in church so anything strapless or with thin straps should be avoided. Skirts and dresses should at a minimum come below the knee. Some churches ask that no leg be shown. Keep your feet on the ground when seated, because it is considered insulting for your feet to face holy images."
26,Anafiotika,"Athens, Greece",The Cycladic architecture makes this Athens neighborhood feel like an island paradise hidden in the shadow of the Acropolis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/anafiotika,"Just below the north slope of the Acropolis and above Plaka is Anafiotika is a tiny neighborhood of whitewashed houses built according to Cycladic architecture. Wandering among these houses will make you feel as though you’ve been transported to a Greek island. In 1840, experienced builders from the island of Anafi came to Athens to work on the new Royal Palace and excavation sites around the Acropolis. Taking advantage of a law that decreed that if you could put up a structure between sunset and sunrise the property became yours, these builders hastily built houses on the steep hillside. They called their settlement Anafiotika, (“Little Anafi”), after their island. There are no stores, cafés or souvenir shops, just small whitewashed houses with bright shutters built on narrow streets with many bougainvillea-covered walls. But though the settlement is charming, its history has been difficult. Most of the original village was destroyed in 1950 for archaeological research. In 1970, the Greek government began buying houses and demolished 20 more of them. There are fewer than 50 houses left, most of them inhabited by the descendants of the original Anafi families. Current owners of the houses are prohibited from selling or transferring them to non-family members, the only other option being selling them to the Greek government. The area is home to several Byzantine churches, including the 11th-century Church of the Metamorphosis Sotiros, which has a rear grotto carved into the Acropolis; the 17th-century Monastery of the Holy Sepulchre, where the Holy Light first arrives from Jerusalem on the evening of Holy Saturday during Easter week; and the 17th0century Church of St. George of the Rock, which has a garden  memorializing the Evzone Konstantinos Koukidis who wrapped himself in the Greek flag he was guarding and leaped off the Acropolis when the Germans invaded Athens in 1941.  Google maps shows Anafiotika located on the south slope of the Acropolis. This is wrong as it is on the north slope. Dress codes vary from church to church in Greek orthodoxy. If you wish to enter any of the churches, a show of respect to the church and its members is achieved by modest clothing and proper behavior. For men, shorts, tank tops/sleeveless shirts, and sandals/flip flops are frowned upon. Women's shoulders should not be shown in church, so anything strapless or with thin straps should be avoided. Skirts and dresses should at a minimum come below the knee. Some churches ask that no leg be shown."
27,Hadrian's Reservoir,"Athens, Greece",This ancient hydrological marvel is now the base of a modern outdoor cinema.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hadrians-reservoir,"One of Roman Athens’ most amazing engineering feats now lies below a modern outdoor movie theater. Fans of the silver screen can gather beneath the night air to watch their favorite films, all while perched atop a nearly 2,000-year-old reservoir. Due to Athens’ growing water needs in the second century CE, Emperor Hadrian ordered a project to increase the city’s water supply. Construction thus started in 125 for an aqueduct that began at Mount Parnitha and stretched more than 12 miles to the base of Mount Lycabettus, where a reservoir was built. The aqueduct consisted primarily of an underground channel constructed manually through solid rock. When completed in 140 CE, it was Athens’ largest infrastructure project to date. Hadrian’s Reservoir sits at the western base of Mt. Lycabettus. Pipes originating there provided enough water to cover the needs of the area’s residents for over 1,000 years. The structure had a propylon (destroyed in the late 18th-century) with four Ionic columns and an architrave with a dedication to Hadrian and his successor Antoninus Pius, during whose reign the work was completed. The reservoir was abandoned during the Ottoman Empire’s occupation, causing most residents to become reliant on wells. Restoration of the aqueduct began in 1847, though it ceased to be a main source of water after the construction of the Marathon Dam in 1929. Today, it no longer supplies drinking water. Some water from the reservoir still makes it to the end, though it empties right into the sewer. Currently, only parts of the steps and two column bases remain at the site. A portion of the architrave also still exists, though it currently sits in the National Gardens.  The reservoir sits in Dexameni (Reservoir) Square, beneath Cinema Dexameni. Access inside the reservoir building is restricted; however, there are large viewing portals on the western walls that offer a great view inside. Annually on January 6, the Epiphany, the Greek Orthodox ritual of the “Blessing of the Waters” is held in front of the reservoir. During this ritual, the reservoir is opened and the water is blessed by a priest, who immerses a cross in the water and then sprinkles followers with the now-holy water. If you wish to view the portion of the architrave that still exists, it sits in the National Gardens near the Children's Library."
28,Magic Sphere of Helios,"Athens, Greece",This mystical orb covered in strange symbols is thought to have been used in ancient Greek magical rituals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/magic-sphere-of-helios,"The celestial symbols covering this odd orb bewitch the imagination. And according to some, that’s exactly the point, as it’s thought the ancient Greeks may have used the sphere in magic rituals. The large marble sphere was found in 1866 at the Theater of Dionysus, which stands at the foot of the famed Acropolis. It’s believed the curious orb was created sometime between the second and third centuries CE. Not much is known about the strange sphere. Because it was found buried near the Theater of Dionysus—a place where duels and various sporting events were held—it’s said the ball may have been used in magic rituals by those hoping to win. The carvings adorning the sphere are mysterious and mystical. Most agree the human figure is a depiction of Helios, the god of the Sun. He sits atop a grand throne, clutching a whip in one hand and three lit torches in the other. A great beast rests at his feet, which is said to be either a lion or a dog and is thought to represent a constellation. Other animal and celestial symbols cover the rest of the sphere. Scan the globe, and you’ll come across a whole medley of magical, alchemistic, and astral symbols. You can find this object in the Acropolis Museum, 1st floor, North wing Section: Athens and Rome | No. Index ΕΜ 2260."

Virtually invisible unless deliberately sought out, Atlantis Books is a tiny bookstore packed with some of the greatest literary works by authors such as Leo Tolstoy and Samuel Beckett. Opened in 2004 by a group of young and adventurous college students, the shop offers a plethora of books from international authors translated into English. A small set of stairs framed by vines funnels visitors past a vibrant mural and into the bookstore. The store is a winding maze of books, all sorted by genre. You’ll find anything from literary classics to intriguing newer titles. Splashed along white walls are quotes and colorful illustrations that swirl around the entire bookstore. There’s also a timeline of the bookstore’s creation running along one wall. Chairs and tables are tucked into the nooks and crannies of the area, inviting readers to sit down and get lost within the pages of a book. Don’t be surprised if you spot a cat or two snoozing among the stacks. Above ground, the bookstore boasts a patio offering a stunning view of the sparkling sea. Update as of January 2023: The shop is closed indefinitely."
30,Prehistoric Town of Akrotiri,"Santorini, Greece",A Bronze age settlement on the Greek island of Santorini might have been the inspiration for Plato's Atlantis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prehistoric-town-of-akrotiri,"Tucked away at the southern tip of Santorini are the ruins of one of the Bronze age’s most sophisticated settlements, which prospered for centuries before being eradicated by a great volcanic eruption. Like the Roman ruins of Pompeii, the remains of the Minoan town of Akrotiri are remarkably well-preserved. The settlement was all but obliterated in the middle of the second millennium BC, when the volcano it sat upon, Thera, erupted, and its inhabitants fled. The volcanic matter enveloped the entire island of Santorini and the town itself, preserving the buildings and their contents, and visitors can still identify houses and pots. Unlike Pompeii, no human remains have been found at Akrotiri, and only one gold object was found on the site, suggesting that the Minoans performed an orderly evacuation before the eruption, and they had time to take their valuables before they fled. The Minoan civilization existed on Crete and its surrounding Greek islands, and flourished from approximately 3600 BC to 1400 BC. The eruption of Thera has been credited with its demise; geologists have called it the most destructive natural event in recorded history. The town of Akrotiri was an outpost of Crete which dates back to the third millennium BC and gradually developed into one of the main ports and urban centers of the Aegean. Akrotiri was incredibly sophisticated for its time. The buildings in the town were multi-storeyed and faced with masonry, and the elaborate drainage system was highly evolved–it is here that we see some of the first instances of indoor lavatories. The town’s elaborate architecture and vivid frescoes indicate a highly cultured settlement. It is perhaps this level of sophistication that has lead scholars and historians to believe that Akrotiri served as Plato’s inspiration for the city of Atlantis. In his dialogues Timaios and Kritias, Plato wrote of an island on which there was “a great and wonderful empire,” which was suddenly destroyed. “There occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth,” Plato wrote, “and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea.” Some scholars have argued that Plato’s description of the sudden obliteration of Atlantis is parallel to the eruption of Thera and the subsequent destruction of Akrotiri. Since “Akrotiri” is a modern name given to the settlement after the nearby town of the same name, there is no way of knowing what the original inhabitants knew their home as–perhaps it was “Atlantis.”  After being closed for a number of years for repair work, the archeological site has reopened to visitors, and can be accessed by car or bus from Fira.Open hours between November and March: from 08.00 to 15.00, every day except Monday.Open hours between April to October: from 08.00 to 20.00, every day. Visitors who are asthmatic or sensitive to dust should know that the archeological site is enclosed."
31,Tower of the Winds,"Athens, Greece",An ancient octagonal weather station named for the eight Greek gods of wind.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tower-of-the-winds,"Most archaeological sites in Athens are old temples, but this ancient structure had a scientific purpose. When it was constructed at the end of the 2nd century BCE, the Tower of the Winds included sundials, a clepsydra (water clock), and a weather vane, effectively making it the first meteorological station in the world. The octagonal structure was made almost entirely out of Pentelic marble, the same kind used for the Parthenon, which is rare to find in any structures other than temples. Built to measure time, it is also known as a horologion, meaning timepiece. Each of its eight sides faces a point on the compass, and features a frieze depicting each of the eight ancient Greek wind gods, giving the tower its name. They are: Boreas  (north),  Kaikias (northeast), Eurus (east), Apeliotes (southeast), Notus (south), Lips (southwest), Zephyrus (west), and Skiron (northwest). Beneath the friezes are eight vertical sundials where the shadow was cast on hour lines that, while faint, are still visible today. The building was originally topped with a bronze weather vane depicting the Greek Messenger of the Sea Triton, his hand pointing in the direction from which the wind was blowing. The interior of the structure contained a complicated internal clepsydra, or water clock, which was driven by water flowing down from a large well under the Acropolis. This was essential for use on cloudy days or at night when the sundials were ineffective. In early Christian times the structure was converted to a church, and the space outside to the northeast was used as a cemetery. During the Ottoman period, it was used as a place of worship by Sufi Muslim Whirling Dervishes. The Dervishes left after the Greek victory on the War of Independence, and afterward the building deteriorated until a restoration project between 1837 and 1845, when it was discovered that half the structure became covered with the earth and debris that had accumulated over the centuries, and half of it was underground. Modern restorations have salvaged the ancient scientific structure, which is located in the Roman Agora between the Plaka and Monastaraki neighborhoods of Athens."
32,Bluie East Two,"Ikateq, Greenland",A surprisingly beautiful abandoned World War II military base in East Greenland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bluie-east-two,"Bluie East Two, aka “BE2,” is an abandoned U.S. Army Air Corps base from World War II. (“Bluie” was the military code name for Greenland during the war.) What remains of the disused airfield today are thousands of empty fuel drums and heaps of twisted metal and rusted vehicles. In the background, the scenery is spectacular. Getting to this remote site requires some work. It’s located on Greenland’s east coast, about an hour-and-a-half flight from Keflavik, Iceland, followed by two boat rides. The journey is an all-day outing, but whales and glacier calving will also be seen during the trip. The military base sits on the east shore of a channel from a larger fjord. You could spend hours exploring this place and its abandoned airstrip, and while you might expect such a place to be haunting, the opposite is true. It’s serene and oddly beautiful, with a backdrop of mountains and glaciers and a calming narrow fjord channel in the fore. Following reports of toxic waste, Denmark agreed to clean up this deserted site, many locals prefer it to remain as it is a bit of a tourist draw. They say that any fuel contamination has long disappeared, and all that remains are the rusted metal heaps and drums left behind some 70 years ago.  Visitors land in Kulusuk, and from there take a 40-minute boat ride to Tasiilaq on the island of Angmagssalik. Here, boat rides can be taken to Bluie East Two."
33,The Oldest Chunk of Rock in the World,Greenland,The 3.8 billion-year-old rock proves that tectonic plates may have been shifting longer than we thought.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oldest-chunk-of-rock-in-the-world-isua-supracrustal-belt,"In 2007, scientists discovered some of the oldest segments of the earth’s crust on an island off the coast of Greenland. The rocks they discovered are at least 3.8 billion years old. Although very old, scientists had previously found older rocks still–the oldest, in fact. They are 4.28 billion years old, making them 250 million years more ancient than any previously discovered rocks. Earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a disk of gas and dust circling the sun. Remnants of crust from Earth’s infancy are hard to come by because most of that material has been recycled into Earth’s interior several times by the plate tectonics that continues to shape our planet’s surface. As if the crust’s age weren’t enough to make this find it significant, there’s more. The find is an ophiolite, a rock created when one tectonic plate is forced underneath the other. Essentially, one bit of an oceanic or continental plate is shaved off onto the other, forming a layered rock. Ophiolites are important signs of plate tectonics and the 3.8 billion-year-old rock signals that plate tectonics may have been moving around the Earth’s surface for more than a billion years longer than scientists originally hypothesized. This chunk of rock was found in what scientists call an island arc environment, consisting of a row of volcanoes near the spots where tectonic plates are converging. These arcs are formed when water released from a subducted plate melts the rocks above and causes magma to punch through the crust above. For the record, this ophiolite is merely the largest chunk of such rock ever discovered. Small, 4.4 billion-year-old chunks of zircon have been found within other rocks before now."
34,The Flowers of Kaffeklubben Island,Greenland,The world's northernmost flowers cling tenuously to life on desolate Kaffeklubben Island.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-flowers-of-kaffeklubben-island-greenland,"On this small, glacial moraine island off the coast of Greenland’s Cape Morris Jessup, specimens of Arctic Poppy and Purple Saxifrage grow in the thin, rocky soil. Kaffeklubben Island is practically a polar desert with roughly 30-day summers. Despite these extremely inhospitable conditions, these two tiny flowering plants eek out a meager existence and persist blooming through summer lows in the high 20’s Fahrenheit. This area is so far north that it was out of the historical ranges of all Inuit and although spotted by Robert Edwin Peary in 1900, was left untouched by mankind until it was visited by Danish explorer Lauge Koch the 1921. On Kafeklubben Island, These scant meadows of Purple Saxifrage and Arctic Poppy (both of which are edible) grow with various mosses, liverworts, and lichens in a place that may take millennia to deposit a layer of soil a foot thick on top of the permafrost and gravel. The tenacious purple saxifrage is not only perched on “the top of the world”, but also hold the title for being the highest elevation plant as well. It was discovered in the Swiss alps by Swiss botanist Christian Körner at an elevation of 14,780 ft. While It is not possible to visit Kaffeklubben Island unless you are part of a sponsored expedition with full equipment, both of these horticultural tough guys can be found throughout Sweden and Norway.  It is not physically possible to visit here unless you are part of a sponsored expedition with full equipment"
35,Camp Century (Project Iceworm),Greenland,A Cold War atomic camp buried under the ice is now emerging because of global warming.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/camp-century,"The creepily named Project Iceworm was a secret U.S. Cold War mission to plan missile launch sites under the ice in Greenland. The plan was to dig 2,500 miles of tunnels in which to store and maybe someday launch 600 nuclear missiles. Greenland was an ideal site because of its proximity to Russia, but this also made the construction that much more risky. It was kept a secret from Denmark, of which Greenland is a constituent. But you can’t just go digging thousands of miles in in the ice and expect no one to notice. So, as a cover, the U.S. Army claimed to be building “Camp Century,” a “research facility” sanctioned by Denmark. Built in 1960 near Thule Air Base, its stated purpose was to study construction techniques and established scientific experiments under Arctic conditions. In actuality it was all a cover; the underground research facility gave the U.S. an excuse to dig under the ground to plant the missiles. Though Camp Century was a diversion, it wasn’t totally hollow. Coring deep into the ice allowed scientists to study thousands of years of climate history. They were also able to look back in time by observing germs preserved in water that melted off glaciers. People lived and worked there year-round—the underground camp included a chapel, a theater, and a hobby shop, all contained in interconnected tunnels sort of like an ant colony. All the electricity was supplied by the world’s first mobile nuclear reactor, which was assembled elsewhere then placed in the deep recesses of the snow. Though Camp Century utilized some traditional building materials like wood and steel, most of the tunnels were simply dug into the ice (hence the name “Iceworm”). It was predicted to have lasted ten years without substantial upkeep, but the glaciers were moving faster than expected, which would ultimately render the camp unusable. It was evacuated, used infrequently for a few years, then totally abandoned in 1967. When Camp Century was deserted, it was left almost entirely intact. The U.S. military assumed consistent snowfall and crushing glaciers would encase the research facility for all time. However, in 2016, an investigation revealed that because global warming has caused the ice sheet covering Camp Century to melt, the facility may be unearthed by the end of the century, maybe sooner. If and when that happens, any waste—radioactive or otherwise—that’s uncovered along with the base could wind up disrupting the surrounding ecosystems—a wholly unintended consequence of a top-secret Cold War plot."
36,Kulusuk,"Tasiilaq, Greenland",Small Island off the coast of Greenland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kulusuk,"You are greeted by polar bear skins in the arrivals ‘lounge’. You can walk into the tiny town easily. Once there you can find a hotel with excellent polar bear carpet, huskies and their pups (in summer) and some breathtaking scenery. You can get a sense of the scale of the place if you hike up to the radar station and you can enjoy views of the ‘burgs and excellent mobile reception."
37,Qilakitsoq Mummies,"Nuuk, Greenland",These eight mummies are the best-preserved human remains ever discovered in North America.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/qilakitsoq-mummies,"When two brothers went out hunting for grouse one morning in 1972, they had no idea they’d end the day uncovering what would become one of Greenland’s most treasured artifacts. But that’s exactly what happened. As the pair combed the landscape for game, they came across the abandoned Inuit settlement of Qilakitsoq, and soon uncovered eight frozen mummies that had been buried under a large pile of stones. The corpses they found were not intended to be mummified at the time of their burial, but thanks to Greenland’s ice-cold climate, the natural elements had kept the bodies in an exceptionally well-preserved state. Alerting the authorities to their discovery, researchers and archaeologists journeyed to the site, knowing the newly discovered mummies were an unrivaled opportunity to learn more about the life, customs, and traditions of Greenland’s native Inuit population. Using x-ray and other methods to ensure the site remained as intact as possible, scientists were able to date the mummies—which totaled six women, a young boy, and an extremely young baby—to somewhere around 1475. Along with the mummies, most of which were heavily tattooed on their foreheads, eyebrows, and chins, researchers uncovered 78 pieces of clothing that were made from reindeer, seal, and other skins. But the most interesting, or perhaps shocking, discovery was that the small infant mummy appeared to have been buried alive. Inuit tradition at the time dictated that if a mother passed away, her smaller children must be buried with her, even if they were completely healthy. The reasoning for such a ghastly act is sad but seems practical for the time, with local cultural norms dictating that absent their mother, children had no one to care for them and must travel together with their maternal guardian to safely reach the land of the dead.  Four of the Qilakitsoq mummies are on permanent display at the Greenland National Museum in Nuuk. Admission is free but check the museum's website for operating days/hours as they vary based on the season."
38,Summit Camp,Greenland,This remote research station sits amid the second-largest ice sheet on the planet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/summit-camp,"Situated at the highest point of the Greenland ice sheet, the second-largest body of ice on Earth, Summit Camp is one of the most remote research stations in the world. It sits amid an enormous ice cap that covers about 80 percent of the surface of Greenland—a giant frozen mass that would cause sea levels to rise some 24 feet if it were all to melt. The station at its apex is also one of the most challenging to access, inhabited by just a handful of people in the wintertime. The nearest town, Ittoqqortoormiit, is 285 miles (460 km) away. The summit is at an altitude of over 10,000 feet (3,200 meters) and usually experiences temperatures between -58˚F to 14˚F (-50°C to -10°C). It’s open year-round, used by scientists to monitor various aspects of this extreme Arctic climate, such as air-snow interactions, and measure greenhouse gas, among other research. The two main permanent structures at the camp are called the Big House and the Green House. The former serves as the main building, with offices, the kitchen, a full bathroom, and laundry facilities. The Green House contains a science laboratory, an emergency kitchen, communications, and other amenities, and it is connected to the main living quarters. A generator supplies the station with electric energy, and the heat produced is also used to power a snow melter that provides water to this far-flung facility. Permits from the Danish Polar Center and the Home Rule of Greenland are required to visit the station. Access is provided via the Kangerlussuaq Airport, but during winter visits are infrequent. The exact coordinates of the station vary because of the constantly shifting ice."
39,Arboretum Groenlandicum,"Narsarsuaq, Greenland",An experimental forest at the foreground of arboreal science is also the canary in the coal mine for climate change.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arboretum-groenlandicum,"In the middle of the 20th century, the icy island nation of Greenland in the North Atlantic faced a bit of an arboreal conundrum, and pillaging its neighbors’ trees seemed to be the only answer. Established just outside Narsarsuaq in 1954 when arborists became aware that it wasn’t Greenland’s soil that had prevented forestation from taking place, Arboretum Groenlandicum began as a place for species of trees native to the country to be given a fresh shot a life in a new locale. But once they got started, scientists figured why stop there? The experiment at Narsarsuaq became a sort of scientific articulation of the theory “if you build it, they will come,” testing the limits of cultivating an effective, natural, yet wholly fabricated forest environment. What resulted was a small forest that’s about as technicolor (for an arctic pine forest) as any on the planet. Over the following decades, saplings and seeds of boreal trees and shrubs were borrowed from all over the northern hemisphere. And by the dawn of the new millennia, the greenery at Arboretum Groenlandicum was thriving. Within its nearly 500 acres lived nearly all the subarctic and northern subalpine tree-line species found in the Northern Hemisphere, including species like lodgepole pine commonly associated with the American Rocky Mountains, Siberian larch, Norwegian spruces, Scots pine, Himalaya birch, a diverse assortment of broadleaved trees, and many more. More somberly, the forest at Arboretum Groenlandicum has become experimental on an additional, unexpected front; due to its location in an environment at the forefront of global warming, the exceptionally diverse stand of trees is now also being studied to monitor the consequences of global warming in the individual specimens themselves, before the waves of change reach their nations of origin. The far southern fjords of Greenland do actually contain some stunted forests composed of various willow species, Downy Birch, Green Alder, Greenland Mountain Ash, Labrador Tea, and Creeping Juniper. There is evidence based on pollen records that these stunted forests extended in patches as far north as Nuuk as recently as 1000 years ago. The climate is also a transitional one between a milder-winter subarctic climate and a colder-winter sub-polar oceanic climate, with summer highs in the 60’s, it is roughly hardiness zone 4b or 5a and could be compared to Alaska’s Seward Peninsula and/or Iceland’s northeastern plateau."
40,Qaqortoq Road,"Qaqortoq, Greenland","In a country where driving from one town to another is literally impossible, this small stretch of gravel is a remarkable feat.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/qaqortoq-road,"With only some 55,000 people spread out over more than 800,000 square miles, Greenland takes home the prize for the least densely populated country in the world. While this means Greenlanders have plenty of space to roam, it makes the actual logistics of getting from one point to another much more complicated than your average developed nation. In fact, the country’s vastness coupled with its naturally icy and rocky terrain means that while there are roads within communities, none of Greenland’s towns or cities are connected to one another over land. Constructing even a basic road between two Greenlandic population centers is prohibitively expensive and equally impractical. As a result, Greenlanders must take to the skies, or hop on a boat when the weather allows, to travel any meaningfully long distance within the country. That’s why at just 3.8 miles (6.2 kilometers) long, a newly built road in Qaqortoq, in the country’s far south, holds the impressive title of  the country’s longest single road built since World War II. To be honest, there isn’t much competition. As of now, though, the longest road in Greenland is also a road to nowhere. Constructed in 2015 to link the town to a new nearby airport that will boast a nearly 5,000 foot (1,500 meters) long runway, the road was completed but the airport has yet to materialize. Until that happens, Qaqortoq’s 3,000 residents will have to stick to the town’s helipad for their travel needs."
41,Infrasound Station IS18,"Thule, Greenland",Neither bomb blasts nor heartbeats escape the giant ears of this super sci-fi Arctic outpost.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/infrasound-station-is18,"The terrain at Qaanaaq is treacherous and harsh; there’s no way in but by helicopter. Once there, one is met with unpaved roads that demand a four-wheel drive vehicle on a good day. Locals keep to the traditional way of life, subsisting on fresh-caught seal, polar bear, and narwhal… yet this desolate outpost in remotest Greenland is home to one of the world’s most high-tech listening devices, tasked with saving humanity from itself. Located along the coastline just outside the village of Qaanaaq – which bears the additional distinction of being the world’s most northerly palindrome – the sole purpose of Infrasound station IS18 consists of listening to the planet’s groans that occur at frequencies too low for the human ear to detect, occurring within the range of 20 Hz down to 0.001 Hz. Qaaanaaq’s eight-element array is divided into two sub-arrays bolstered by wind reduction technology, all of which are linked to a Central Processing Facility (or CPF) that churns out data around-the-clock to a central terminal in Qaanaaq proper. But why put such an extremely space-age device in a village accessible only by helicopter, whose locals subsist largely on narwhal, seals, and polar bears? In its most practical application, IS18 is part of a network of highly specialized sensors charged with monitoring the globe for atomic blasts, as set forth by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO). Around the clock, the array monitors the entire world for distinctive blast patterns produced by such explosions, as their unique pattern of ultra-low frequency sound waves persist even when ricocheting through the Earth’s surface. More broadly, the range of sounds IS18 can detect doesn’t only include mankind’s attempts to annihilate itself. Infrasound is used to trace earthquakes, locate petroleum deposits based on their movements, and monitor the human heart in ballistocardiography. When viewed in this light, it seems like Greenland’s observatory at the end of the world is keeping tabs on the pulse of us all, perhaps on an even more enormously important scale than we thought."
42,Stone & Man,"Qaqortoq, Greenland",One Greenland town turned itself into an open air sculpture gallery with the help of a series of traditional stone artworks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stone-and-man,"All throughout the Greenlandic town of Qaqortoq, carved into boulders and lichen-covered rock faces, are carvings of whales, faces, and other traditional designs. Together these stoneworks are a citywide work of art known as Stone & Man. The project is the work of local Qaqortoq artist Aka Høegh, who endeavored to turn her home town into a permanent open air art gallery, and essentially, a work of art in and of itself. With the help over a dozen artists hailing from other Nordic countries like Norway, Iceland, Finland, Sweden, and of course Greenland itself, Høegh oversaw the creation of 24 separate carvings and sculptures. Some of the works took the shape of fully shaped sculptures made out of local boulders, while others looked more like recreations of ancient tribal markings of fish and whales. More sculptures have been added to the collection over the years and now, Qaqortoq is home to around 40 sculptures and carvings spread around town. The majority of the Stone & Man works are clumped near the Qaqortoq Museum, which has an impressive collection of carved talismans in its collection for visitors who can’t get enough of Greenland’s traditional art. Qaqortoq might not be a very big town (although it is the fourth most populous in Greenland), but Stone & Man brings both its culture and its history to the fore.  This is the location of just one of the stone carvings. The rest are distributed throughout Qaqortoq, and local tours are available to guide you."
43,Mindebrønden,"Qaqortoq, Greenland","No longer the only, but definitely the oldest, fountain in Greenland.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mindebronden,"You can probably imagine that, considering the climate, demand for fountains isn’t too high in Greenland. In fact, when it was completed in 1932, Mindebrønden (Memorial Fountain) was the only fountain on the entire island. Construction on the Qaqortoq fountain, forged out of distinctive Igaliku sandstone, began in 1927. The subject matter is also endemic to Greenland. Several whales squirting water out of their blowholes are mounted at the top of the lantern-like base - a nod to the island’s whaling tradition (you’ll likely see some living ones in the fjords surrounding the city). Several smaller spouts arranged around the circular stone basin shoot delicate arcs of water towards the fountain’s center. Mindebrønden is hard to miss, as it’s right in the middle of the very tiny square that makes up Qaqortoq’s very tiny city center. Locals and tourists alike often gather here for lunch on the surrounding picnic tables. The fountain also shares the space with the Qaqortoq Museum, formerly a blacksmiths’ shop, which now showcases both modern art and Greenlandic handicrafts. The only other fountain in Greenland can be found further to the north, in Sisimiut. The center of town in a town so small, you can't miss it."
44,Garðar Cathedral Ruins,"Igaliku, Greenland",Walrus skulls and narwhal bones were found here while excavating a 900-year old church.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gardar-cathedral-ruins,"In the early 12th-century, Norse settlers of Greenland established the first bishop seat on the island in the southern village of Garðar. There, a cathedral dedicated to Saint Nicholas, patron saint of sailors, was founded by Greenland’s first bishop Arnaldur in 1126. The church was composed of red sandstone and is the only known cruciform religious building in Greenland. The original structure was expanded in the following decades to include a bell tower and two chapels. During the 13th and 14th-centuries, the town of Garðar was a thriving farming village thanks to the mild weather. The farm around the cathedral was big enough to hold 100 cows and the bishop lived in a palace surrounded by wealth acquired by heavily taxing the population. Because of several factors such as the Black Death in Europe and a worsening climate that eventually led to the Little Ice Age, ships sailing from Norway to Greenland became rarer and the settlements were slowly abandoned. The last bishop that lived in Garðar died in 1378, but new bishops were appointed until 1537, even though none of them ever visited the diocese. Now, the settlement of Igaliku is located where Garðar once was, and excavations on the site of the former cathedral began in 1926. Walrus skulls and narwhal remains were found here, suggesting that a pagan temple could have been operating in or around the church. A skeleton of a powerful bishop was also found along with various religious ornaments."
45,Nuuk Center,"Nuuk, Greenland",Greenland's first shopping mall also hosts the country's government.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nuuk-center,"Opened in 2012, Greenland’s first mall has everything a shopping center needs: a supermarket, multiple clothes shops, a few restaurants and a café. The surprise lies not in the mall itself, but it the tower above it. The nine-story tower is home to Greenland’s government. Even though Greenland is still under the Danish realm, and therefore is not entirely independent when it comes to defense or foreign policy, the country has its own government for some matters, for example fisheries and hunting, housing, and mineral resources. All of the different Ministries are located here, with the highest floor being, of course, dedicated to the Premier’s office."
46,Santa’s Mailbox,"Nuuk, Greenland",Thousands of letters to Santa get delivered to this mailbox in Greenland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/santa-mailbox,"Ever wonder where letters go when they’re addressed to Santa? Well, it turns out that they don’t go directly to the North Pole, but many of them are sent as close to it as possible: a giant red mailbox in the capital of Greenland. Every winter, thousands of letters addressed to Santa are routed to one mailbox in Nuuk, Greenland, where they are opened and read by a handful of volunteers from the small town of 17,000. When possible, the volunteers use Google Translate to deliver a handwritten response to the children (be they naughty or nice) in their native language. In addition to letters, Santa’s mailbox also receives a handy amount of pacifiers in the mail. (Apparently, many parents ween their kids off of their pacifiers by having them mailed to St. Nick.) The huge mailbox is located outside the Nuuk tourism office and is one of the major attractions in the city. It is emptied on December 24th each year, ready to receive a fresh batch of correspondence next winter. Update July 2018: This mailbox is closed and has removed."
47,Blok P,"Nuuk, Greenland","1% of Greenland's entire population used to live in this single building, which is now slated for demolition.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blok-p,"With a population of roughly 57,637, Greenland is clearly not the most inhabited place on Earth, it seems hard to believe that 1% of the entire country’s population once resided in the same apartment building. But reside together they did, in the 320-unit apartment complex that was not only the largest residential building in the town of Nuuk, but the largest in all of Greenland. In an attempt by the Danish parliament to eliminate coastal Inuit settlements and bring Greenland’s infrastructure into the modern day, the garish and unwelcoming Blok P came into being. Construction began in 1965, a 5-story monstrosity that stretched 64 apartments wide, Blok P was an eyesore from the very beginning, and not even remotely conducive to Inuit ways of life. Primarily fisherman, the reluctant residents of Blok P struggled to fit their fishing gear in the tiny closets designed more for shoes and handbags than bulky nets and poles. Much of their equipment ended up on balconies, blocking fire exits and eliminating any semblance of aesthetic charm the building may have had. Narrow hallways and doors weren’t wide enough for the giant fur coats that were an essential staple of everyone’s wardrobe, and the dwellings were cramped and uncomfortable. The most unpleasant oversight on the part of the Danes was the absence of a suitable place for the Inuits to gut their daily catch. For lack of a better solution, the fishermen used the only reasonable place—the bathtub. This resulted in drains clogged with coagulated blood and chunks of fish guts, a not-so-delightful addition to the already uncomfortable lodgings. In 2010 the government finally called it, started relocating residents, and scheduled the building for demolition. which took place in 2013. While the failed “urbanization project” is no more, it has inspired many community projects and artistic social exhibitions, most notably a permanent exhibit at the North Atlantic House, a cultural center in Copenhagen."
48,Sark Dark Sky Island,"Sark, Guernsey",The first island in the world designated a light-pollution-free astronomical observation point.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sark-dark-sky-island,"The tiny Channel Island community of Sark was awarded the distinction of becoming the world’s first Dark Sky Island in 2011, indicating its excellent light-free location for naked-eye astronomical observation. The International Dark Sky Association was formed in 1988 in the United States by astronomer Dr. David Crawford and physician Dr. Timothy Hunter to raise awareness of light pollution and its effect on our nighttime ability to stargaze. Sark’s placement, in the waters between France and England far from big-city lights, helped in its selection, as did its lack of automobiles and street lights. The citizens of Sark also made special accommodations, including adjusting existing lights in order to optimize the darkness. There are several other Dark Sky locations around the world, including Natural Bridges National Monument in Utah, Borrego Springs in California, and Hortobagy National Park in Hungary. With a population of just about 600, Sark has its own parliament and its own laws based in ancient Norman tradition. Long standing as the last stronghold of the feudal system of government in Europe, Sark only introduced a democratic system of government in 2006. Up until then the tiny island could trace its governing system directly to a fiefdom set up under Queen Elizabeth I."

Dissatisfied with the finished product, he immediately began constructing another one that lasted for about ten years before demolishing it in 1923. Years later, before returning back to France, Déodat finally fulfilled his vision and built what is still today The Little Chapel.

50,German Military Underground Hospital,Guernsey,Underground hospital complex constructed by slave laborers during the German occupation of the Channel Islands.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/german-military-underground-hospital,"Between the years of 1940 and 1945 hundreds of slave laborers working under the direction of German occupying forces dug 7,000 square meters in underground tunnels beneath Les Naftiaux in the British territory island of Guernsey. The laborers, men and women of numerous nationalities, many of whom died in the tunnels’ construction, used explosives, drills, hand tools, and their bare hands to carve these tunnels from solid rock. The subterranean complex was intended for use as a German military hospital and ammunitions storehouse. By the time construction ceased at the onset of the D-Day invasion the hospital complex was large enough to house 500 patients and included facilities such as an operating room, X-ray room, dispensary, laboratory, and staff quarters, as well as a cinema, central heating plant, and kitchen. In addition to the three main entrances, the ventilation shafts were equipped with stairs and ladders so they could double as emergency exits. For all its planning, after three years of construction the hospital was only in use for around three months during the summer of 1944 when German casualties of the D-Day invasion filled all available wards. Hospital operations were eventually moved above ground when it became clear that the tunnels’ damp, dark atmosphere was not conducive to recovery. The ammunitions storage facilities fared slightly better, serving their intended purpose for around nine months. Although much of the remaining equipment was removed by Allied forces in 1945, some remnants of the hospital’s wartime use remain, including hospital beds, kitchen and heating equipment, and signs in German posted throughout. The tunnels are privately owned by Joyce Browning who opened them to the public in 1954."
51,Sark Prison,"Sark, Guernsey",One of the world's smallest prisons boasts just two small cells.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sark-prison,"With room for just two prisoners, Sark Prison just may be the world’s smallest prison that’s still in use today. It doesn’t receive many inmates these days, but does sometimes host a seasonal worker or tourist after they’ve had one too many drinks. Sark is a fascinating little island in the Channel Islands, just off the coast of Normandy, France. Measuring just three miles long and one mile wide, and with a population of around 500, it’s one of the smallest of the inhabited Channel Islands. Despite its small size, Sark has a long and colorful history. It first appears in written history in 1040, when William of Normandy (later William the Conqueror) gave it as a gift to the Mont-Saint-Michel Abbey. It was captured by the French in 1549, but was soon retaken by the English, and was frequented by smugglers and pirates. More recently, the strategically important island was occupied by the Germans during World War II. It was also considered the last feudal state in Europe up until 2006, when universal suffrage and democracy were officially introduced. And in 2011, Sark had the honor of becoming the world’s first Dark Sky Island. Sark also has the distinction of being home to what is probably the smallest prison still in use in the world. Built in 1856, the tiny barrel-roofed jail has two adjoining cells, one measuring 6 feet by 6 feet and the other 6 feet by 8 feet. In front of the cells is a narrow three-foot wide corridor running the length of the building. There are no windows. One of the earliest known occupants was a young servant girl imprisoned for stealing a pocket handkerchief from her mistress. She was held in the prison for three days. She was so terrified of being locked up in the dark cell that the locals decided to let her put her chair in the open doorway, where local ladies sat with her, knitting and talking, until her time was served. These days, crimes on Sark are rare indeed. The island has two unpaid policemen, who bear the titles of Constable and Vingtenier (the Constable’s assistant). The last serious crime took place in 1990, when an unemployed French nuclear physicist named André Gardes launched a one-man invasion of the island, claiming to be the rightful Seigneur (or Lord) of Sark. He rowed across to the island armed with a semi-automatic weapon and put up two posters explaining his intentions. The following day he launched the second phase of his plan, but was promptly punched in the nose by the Constable and arrested. Since Gardes’s invasion, the Constable and Vingtenier have rarely had to concern themselves with more than an occasional drunk. Most of the prison’s temporary residents have been inebriated seasonal workers and intoxicated tourists, who have spent the night in one of the two cells until they sober up.  Sark Prison is located next to the Visitor Center just off Mill Lane in the center of the island. Sark is one of the Channel Islands, and lies about 7 miles east of Guernsey and about 25 miles west of the Cherbourg Peninsula of France. No cars are allowed on the island—only tractors—but it’s easy enough to get around on foot.

Despite the confusing name, the welcoming drinking establishment attracts visitors from all over the world with its shaggy interior, and locals with its hearty Hungarian fare.. Covering every inch of just about every surface are small pieces of paper stapled and pinned by years worth of customers looking to mark their passing. Drawings, notes, business cards, paintings, and pictures are just a few of the mementos that have been attached to the bar interior, making the space look like its grown particularly flammable fur. To add to the oft-noted fire risks in the bar, the floors are covered in straw and patrons are encouraged to shell the free peanuts they are given straight to the floor. The only thing not for sale at this pub is pretension."
53,Szabo Ervin Library,"Budapest, Hungary","A 19th century artistocrat's mansion, turned into a library, hidden in a modern library.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/szabo-ervin-library,"The incredible Szabo Ervin Library in Budapest is a hidden treasure, left out of guidebooks, tucked into a busy section of the city. But for those in the know, the Szabo Ervin Library is a stunning step back to a time when libraries were like mansions - perhaps that’s because it’s in one. Built by Count Frigyes Wenckheim (1842 – 1912), a well-known Hungarian aristocrat at the end of the 19th century, the Central Library is easy to miss - today a modern library surrounds it, secreting away the beautifully preserved Wenckheim Palace. The City Council purchased the building and converted the beautiful palace rooms into reading rooms for their new library in 1931. The Hungarian neo-baroque arcitecture makes for a handsome backdrop to the walls of leather tomes. The old Dining Room, converted to a long reading room, centered by a long table, once for feasts, now for quiet contemplation, is an especially ambient place. The former Smoking Room, with its spiral staircase leading to a gallery also stands out. These two rooms are warmly lit and encased in dark wood. While it can be a confusing process to find the Central Library in the maze-like modern section of the library, once you do, all that is left is to pick out a beautiful old book, sink back into a deep leather chair, surrounded by the soft light of chandeliers, and relax like a 19th century Hungarian artistocrat.

54,Panoptikum Budapest,"Budapest, Hungary","A series of caves under Castle Hill that once held the prisoner Vlad Tepes, better known as Count Dracula.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/labyrinth-of-buda-castle,"The Labyrinth beneath Budapest’s Castle Hill is where Vlad Tepes was held captive and tortured for 14 years, starting in 1463. We remember him now as Vlad the Impaler, better known as “Count Dracula” (though the tale is only fiction). For the forint equivalent of about six euros, you can walk through the Labyrinth tunnels. There’s no map or guidebook; you simply follow a few incoherent signs through foggy, damp chambers dotted with mannequins dolled up as characters from the Phantom of the Opera. About midway, you’ll come to the Maze of Darkness. Hold onto the green garden hose and walk through pitch blackness for about five minutes. Don’t let go of the hose, or you’ll end up lost amongst historical prison cells that haven’t been remodeled yet to be safe for tourists. Toward the end, you’ll walk past “Dracula’s chamber,” where a coffin is cast in eerie blue light. You can also try out some rusty shackles bolted to the wall and a “torture cage” that may or may not be safe to climb into. The Labyrinth is still a bit of hidden gem right in the center of the most touristed part of Budapest. This one ain’t kid friendly. Update: The original Labyrinth of Buda Castle closed in 2011 following a police raid. A new attraction called Panoptikum has opened in its place."
55,Shoes on the Danube Promenade,"Budapest, Hungary",A trail of iron footwear stands as a monument to the thousands executed along this riverbank during WWII.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shoes-on-the-danube-promenade,"In October of 1944, Hitler overthrew the leader of the Hungarian government, Miklos Horthy, and replaced him with Ferenc Szalasi. Szalasi, whose ideology closely followed Hitler’s, immediately established the Arrow Cross Party - a fascist, anti-semitic organization that brutally and publicly terrorized the Jews in Budapest by beating and killing them. Nearly 80,000 Jews were expelled from Hungary in a death march to the Austrian border and approximately 20,000 Jews were brutally shot along the banks of the Danube River. The victims were forced to remove their shoes at gunpoint (shoes being a valuable commodity during World War II) and face their executioner before they were shot without mercy, falling over the edge to be washed away by the freezing waters. Shoes on the Danube Promenade is a haunting tribute to this horrific time in history, created by film director Can Togay and the sculptor, Gyula Pauer. Installed along the bank of the Danube River in Budapest, the monument consists of 60 pairs of 1940s-style shoes, true to life in size and detail, sculpted out of iron. This memorial is simple yet chilling, depicting the shoes left behind by the thousands of Jews who were murdered by the Arrow Cross. The style of footwear - a man’s work boot; a business man’s loafer; a woman’s pair of heels; even the tiny shoes of a child - were chosen specifically to illustrate how no one, regardless of age, gender, or occupation was spared. Placed in a casual fashion, as if the people just stepped out of them, these little statues are a grim reminder of the souls who once occupied them - yet they also create a beautiful place of reflection and reverence. At three points along the memorial are cast iron signs with the following text in Hungarian, English, and Hebrew: “To the memory of the victims shot into the Danube by Arrow Cross militiamen in 1944–45. Erected 16 April 2005.” Located along the edge of the Danube River, on the Pest side, just south of the Hungarian Parliament Building. Go there before sunset time, the views are great with the sun dropping down and the lights of the city coming out."
56,Vajdahunyad Castle,"Budapest, Hungary",This Hungarian castle was built out of cardboard and wood until it proved so popular that it got upgraded to stone.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vajdahunyad-castle,"Showcasing four distinct architectural styles, Vajdahunyad Castle is a thoroughly unique tribute to Hungary’s millennium-long architectural tradition. Designed by architect Ignác Alpár in 1896 as part of Hungary’s millennial celebrations (commemorating one thousand years since the medieval Magyars first settled on the plains of Pannonia), Vajdahunyad Castle was originally intended to be a temporary exhibition, and was constructed out of wood and cardboard.  However, the attraction proved such a hit with locals and visitors alike that a more permanent structure was built in 1904. The castle itself is divided into four sections, showcasing Gothic, Baroque, Renaissance, and Romanesque architecture.  Within each section, the castle is further divided, in total comprising twenty-one smaller buildings linked together, each having been designed as a replica of other significant structures to be found throughout Hungary and Romania.  Perhaps the most striking section of the castle is the Gothic wing, modeled on Corvin Castle in Romania, which served as the historical home of János Hunyadi, the Hungarian noble from whom Vajdahunyad Castle derives its name. Located on an artificial island in the heart of Budapest within spitting distance of Hungary’s national monument, Vajdahunyad Castle nonetheless presents an odd contrast to its stately surroundings.  The clash of colors, patterns, engravings, and building materials give the structure an almost funhouse-like appearance, and eerie statues of Béla Lugosi and the anonymous author of the Gesta Hungarorum, “the deeds of the Hungarians,” on the castle grounds add to the site’s dreamy ambiance. The castle also houses the Museum of Hungarian Agriculture."
57,Budapest Castle Hill Funicular,"Budapest, Hungary","Built in 1870 at the bridge that connected Buda and Pest, this spectacular incline railway was almost lost forever during World War II.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/budapest-castle-hill-funicular,"At the bottom of Castle Hill is the Széchenyi Chain Bridge, Hungary’s first permanent structure to cross the Danube River. It opened in 1849, and the solid span of wrought iron and stone connected Buda and Pest, the two sides of the capital city. At the top of the hill, rising over 300 feet at an almost 40-degree incline, is Buda Castle—with no easy way, at the time, to get there from the bridge. That changed 21 years later with the opening of the Budavári Sikló, Europe’s second funicular railway. For the next 70-odd years the stepped cars took passengers up and down the equivalent of 30 flights of stairs. Those trips ended during World War II, when the line was destroyed during the bombing of Budapest. Funiculars, also called incline or cable railways, go back hundreds of years. They use a fairly simple pulley system, harnessing the cars’ own counterweight to scoot up and down steep grades like Castle Hill. Without the Budavári Sikló to handle the job, access to Buda Castle meant taking the circuitous route of an autobus. Or worse, walking. Luckily pieces of the funicular had been salvaged after the bombing. It took a long time, but in 1986 the little-railway-that-could reopened along its original track, with most of its original design. It’s now operated by Budapest Public Transport, serving both head-down commuters and eyes-up tourists. The panoramic views of the Danube and west side of the city are unparalleled, and in 1987 the entire Buda Castle District, including the Budavári Sikló, was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The Funicular near the historic Chain Bridge across the Danube. The lower station is on Clark Ádám tér next to the Tunnel, and the upper station is between the Castle and the Sándor-Palace. It's open every day from 07.30 am to 10 pm, and the cars run every 5 to 10 minutes. The fare is HUF 1,200 (about US$4) one way for adults (HUF 1,800 round-trip, about US$6), with reduced fare for kids and students 3-18, under 3 are free."
58,Budapest Cave Church,"Budapest, Hungary","Once the home of a hermetic monk, this cave now houses a small church.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/budapest-cave-church,"On the Buda side of Budapest, tucked into the side Gellert Hill (named after a saint who was stuffed into a spiked barrel and rolled down the hill), is a small cave with a large cross above it. Supposedly once the home of a hermit monk, the cave is today run by the Pauline Monks. The relationship between the Hungarian government and the “Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit” hasn’t always been good. The entire Pauline order was arrested on Easter Monday, 1951, by the Communist government and charged with treason. The head monk was executed, the rest were put into labor camps and the church was sealed behind an eight-foot wall of concrete. In 1989, after the fall of communism in Hungary, the wall was broken down and the cave reopened. Today, the cave walls are all made from concrete and “faux cave,” but the small church still contains some curious features. Besides being rumored to connect to a vast system of underground tunnels, the cave church has a replica of the Black Madonna of Czestochowa, Poland. Black Madonnas are paintings or statues of the Virgin Mary that, for debated reasons, have turned black. Black Madonnas are held to be miraculous and one in particular is said to have saved her Pauline church from fire. Since then the Pauline Monks have worshiped her mysteriously dark visage. Visitors entering the church are expected to dress modestly. If women are wearing dresses or blouses that don't cover the shoulders, shawls will be provided at the entrance that can be returned at the end of their visit."
59,Terror Háza,"Budapest, Hungary",Museum dedicated to the terror regimes of Hungary.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/terror-haza,"As Hungary was infamous for brutality during both the Nazi and Soviet regimes, it’s no surprise that Budapest is home to a museum dedicated to the memory of those tortured and killed in one particular building. In 2000, the ˝The Public Foundation for the Research of Central and East European History and Society˝ purchased what is now called the “Terror House” with the aim of building a museum that would recreate the conditions victims of political brutality faced for decades in Hungary. As the building was used for offices for decades, architects János Sándor and Kálmán Újszászy chose to restore the building back to its original gloominess, and to complete the multi-sensory feel of the space, composer Ákos Kovács created a morose background score. The four floors of the Terror House each offer permanent as well as temporary exhibitions of photographs, historical mementos and video all shedding some light on what these dark periods held in store for those unlucky enough to enter through its doors.

60,Red Ruin,"Budapest, Hungary","This off-beat, quirky communism-themed bar isn't afraid to poke fun at its history.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/red-ruin,"More than most other Eastern European cities that were once part of the Soviet Bloc, Budapest seems to have a sense of humor about its political past. The décor of Red Ruin, a quirky communism theme bar, delightfully subverts communist propaganda with colorful pop art and puns; the drinks are appropriately named and priced to the “people”. The first thing you see when you walk into Red Ruin is a mural of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong in birthday hats, having an enthusiastic “communist party.” Popular with locals and tourists, the bar features kitschy attractions like florescent red lighting, a cardboard poster of Marx and Lenin that you can put your face through, and pop art stencils of Stalin with the caption “Joseph Stylin.” The bar’s labyrinthine, redbrick basement (the entrance to which is easy to miss) features even more wall art and communism jokes. The venue bills itself as one of Budapest’s famous “ruin pubs,” trendy drinking spots set up in derelict buildings or unused outdoor spaces. Red Ruin offers a wide selection of local and international beer, and accepts both cash and card."
61,Szimpla Kert,"Budapest, Hungary","A Trabant car, a kangaroo statue, and a plethora of plants take over this abandoned-factory-turned-bar.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/szimpla-kert,"Walking into Szimpla Kert in Budapest’s District VII is a bit like stumbling into the world’s most interesting junkyard. The former factory has multiple levels and a maze of different rooms, each its own curiosity shop. Now a pub, its decor is a hodgepodge of items, including a kangaroo statue, a Trabant car (in which you can sit and drink), and a bathtub cut open on one side to serve as a couch. There’s graffiti on the walls, and the exposed brick conceals nothing of the building’s structural core. Disco balls hang overhead, as do upturned chairs, and plants sprout up in its large, open-air garden. There’s a method to this madness, which is to elevate items that might be considered junk to the stature of high design. Szimpla Kert, Budapest’s first “ruin bar,” opened in an abandoned factory in 2002, a far cry from elegantly outfitted trendy watering holes. Ruin bars have since become some of the coolest spots in the Hungarian city, seen as successful endeavors at repurposing decaying urban structures into lively communal spaces. But some of these buildings have tragic histories that cannot be overlooked, especially in District VII (also known as Erzsébetváros), which was previously Budapest’s Jewish quarter. Szimpla Kert’s space in particular was once a brick and furnace (some sources say fireplace) factory. By some accounts, the Jewish factory owners were deported during World War II, and the building went through several iterations, becoming a furniture factory and a multi-family residence, before it was vacated completely. As part of an effort to revitalize the neighborhood, Szimpla Kert now hosts regular community events, including a weekly farmer’s market, a flea market, and fundraising programs. It is, however, most well-known for its decor and its entertainment. There are film screenings, theater shows, a “self-awareness disco,” and even a recording studio tucked somewhere in the maze. During the day, the pub is open for food, coffee, live music, and pop-up exhibits. By night, the psychedelic lights turn on and indie bands take the stage. One curious bar offering: a jar of peeled, raw carrots, which are actually quite popular. Carrots or not, both visitors and locals flock to Szimpla Kert for its carefully curated decor, food, drinks, and music.  The best time to go is in the summer months (June to August). If you want to avoid crowds, head there during the daytime."
62,Istvántelek Train Yard,"Budapest, Hungary","The abandoned ""Red Star Train Graveyard"" is the final rusting place for precious artifacts of train history.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/istvantelek-train-yard,"The abandoned Istvántelek Train Yard (Istvántelki főműhely), otherwise known as the “Red Star Train Graveyard,” occupies a vast area of land outside Budapest. More than 100 locomotives and train cars rot away, some in deteriorating depots, others out in the field. Among these are some very rare train engines, and a few cars that are said to have transported prisoners to Auschwitz during the Holocaust. Built at the beginning of the 20th century as a repair yard for the national railway, only a few southern parts of the train yard are still in use, while most of it is abandoned. Two large depots, a few smaller sheds and open-air areas are scattered with locomotives and railcars, some of them very ancient, others more recent, from Hungary’s time as part of the Soviet Regime. Some of the trains were brought here to be repaired and exhibited in the Budapest Railway Museum but never made it to the display and were instead left behind in the train yard. There are a few gems rusting away in the graveyard that are sure to make any train enthusiast’s heart beat faster. A few Hungarian MAV 424 steam engines weigh in at 137 tons and bear a red star on their fronts, which earned the train yard its nickname. There is also an engine of the MAV 301 series, used from 1911 to 1914, which is one of only a few still in existence. Linked to this engine are several German freight cars, which may be the very ones that transported hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews to their death in Auschwitz during Nazi occupation in World War II. Standing in front of the freight cars, one can only imagine the horror, tragedy, and despair that went on inside of them. Among the more recent items in the train graveyard are some engines and cars from the Soviet era, inside of which rail tickets from the 1960s can still be found. Altogether the train graveyard offers a great alternative to the usual Budapest tourism sites, not only for train lovers, but for anyone with an eye for history. The engines and cars are slowly losing their battle against nature, and before long the trains may be entirely obscured by overgrown plant life.  You can find an entrance gate at 47°33'12.1""N 19°06'11.0""E . As of July 2017, there is no public access and papers are needed to get in. It is a industrial area so it is possible that you could sneak in at night or on a Sunday. The fences at the north side are low enough to climb if you watch out for the barbed wire. It is recommended to stay near the first two northern buildings, as there is a guard post toward the south, with train conductors coming and going through the day. Avoid going too far into the woods, as there are stray dogs and guard dogs near some of the southern buildings."
63,The Citadella,"Budapest, Hungary","From Austrians to Nazis to Soviets, this historic Budapest fortress has a history as complex as the city itself.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-citadella-budapest-hungary,"The Citadella was constructed in 1854 by the Hapsburgs as part of their strategy to supervise formerly rebellious Budapest and Hungary to prevent another uprising. The Citadella remains a symbol of oppression as well as liberty. A massive structure 220 meters long, 60 meters wide, and 4 meters tall, the Citadella was occupied by the Austrians until 1899. The locals, still angered by that symbol of foreign oppression started the demolition of the walls, however, most of the citadel structure still stands, and was subsequently used by both Nazis and Communists as a surveillance position, taking advantage of its amazing view over the city. The Nazis used the Citadella mainly as an anti-aircraft position and bunker. Once the Red Army advanced to the city and recovered the territory, the Citadella was used by the Communists as well. After the Hungarian uprising in 1956, the mounted weapons were pointed not to the skies but to the civilian population below. The Communists also took advantage of the high position of the structure and decided to erect a monument that would remind the locals of the sacrifice made by the Eastern liberators who freed the city from the German invaders. Once the monument was finished, it displayed five statues: A woman carrying a torch, representing progress; a man fighting a five-headed dragon symbolizing the struggle against the forces of evil (the Axis powers probably); two Red Army soldiers, representing the liberators; and atop the monument, a 14-meter statue of a woman holding a palm leaf with both hands up to the sky, representing liberty. Once the Communist influence vanished after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the statue of the Red Army soldiers were removed and taken to the Statue Park along with the remaining works of art honoring the invaders of an occupation that lasted four decades. Nowadays the Citadella remains a popular tourist destination. It is a fascinating site where one can see all the wonders of a city that has been called the Paris of Central Europe, as well as explore its troubled history. Update as of December 2019: The interior of the Citadella is currently closed indefinitely to the public.  The Citadella can be reached by bus 27 from Móricz Zsigmond körtér. It is atop Gellert Hill."
64,Semmelweis Medical Museum,"Budapest, Hungary",A museum in the childhood house of a medical pioneer.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/semmelweis-medical-museum,"The Semmelweis Medical Museum (Semmelweis Orvostörténeti Múzeum) in Budapest contains an anatomical Venus by Clemente Susini, an early X-ray machine, and the obligatory shrunken head, all housed in the very building in which Dr. Semmelwies was born. But the most interesting element of the museum is the story of Semmelweis himself. Semmelweis worked during the mid-1800s in the maternity ward of a clinic. Women in maternity wards all over the world were experiencing a mysterious disease called”childbed sickness,” today known as puerperal fever. As many as 30% of mothers died from this disease every month. Semmelweis was tormented over the deaths of so many women, but couldn’t figure out the cause. One day, a colleague died shortly after performing an autopsy, and in a flash of insight, Semmelweis realized that his coworker had had a cut on his finger when he preformed the dissection. It became obvious to Semmelweis that doctors moving immediately from cadavers to pregnant women was not the best idea. Semmelweis implemented a strict hand-washing policy in his clinic, requiring doctors to scrub with chloride of lime, an antiseptic. He also instituted an instrument-washing policy. The death-rate fell noticeably. Semmelweis reported his findings to the great Medical Association of Vienna, but this was several years before Pasteur’s experiments confirmed germ theory; even Semmelweis himself was not sure why his discovery worked. So to most of the medical community, hand-washing simply didn’t make sense. Semmelweis’s discovery was soundly rejected, and in a cruel twist of irony, Semmelweis died — of the very disease he spent his life trying to prevent in others — before seeing his discoveries accepted by the medical community. Clemente Susini’s wax models, painstaking to produce and incredibly fragile, can be seen in only a few other locations throughout the world, including La Specola Museum in Florence, the Josephinum in Vienna, and the Wax Anatomy Museum ot University of Cagliari. — Atlas Obscura visited the Semmelweis Museum on Obscura Day - March 20, 2010"

Purchasing a ticket gives visitors the opportunity to play the games as much as they would like for the entire day, ensuring that there will be more pinball drams for generations to follow."
66,Epreskert Garden,"Budapest, Hungary",The romantic garden was the epicenter of the Hungarian art scene in the 1880s.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/epreskert-garden,"Many Budapest locals have heard the name Epreskert, but only a few are actually familiar with the history of the aesthetic wonderland hidden behind the garden walls. The park has been one of the most important bases for the city’s art scene for well over a century now. The romantically named Epreskert (translated as “Mulberry Garden” or “Strawberry Garden”) near Andrássy Avenue was originally a municipal mulberry field, farmed until the 1870s. As the area became urbanized, the city donated pieces of the land to artists who had performed municipal work. The first was sculptor Adolf Huzsár, who established his studio right outside the garden. The Hungarian University of Fine Arts moved into the plot on the north side of the garden, while on Sugár Street more artists arrived, following Huzsár’s example. The green space in the middle was the artists’ personal garden; during any given stroll one might run into some of the best Hungarian artists of the Belle Époque. With the support of local government, the artists molded Epreskert into a beautiful public space. Several pavilions were installed outside the studios. Alajos Stróbl, renowned sculptor and a professor at the university, landscaped the mulberry garden. With the help of his students, Stróbl also dismantled a 150-year-old chapel in Kálvária Square and transferred it to its present location in Epreskert, stone by stone. He was also known to keep exotic animals, including monkeys, peacocks, deer, and storks, as well as goldfish in his fountain. By the 1880s the Epreskert Artists Colony was well established. Those who could afford it bought mansions and apartments in the booming neighborhood. The sculptors had Lendvay Street, the painters had Bajza Street, and social life was truly blooming in the joint mansion of novelist Mór Jókai and painter Árpád Feszty, since the writer’s adopted daughter married the famous panorama artist. As the colony was gifted by the local government, it followed that only those with the best connections were able to live there. This also meant that Emperor Franz Joseph, among other royals, frequently visited Epreskert and held regal soirees among the bohemians here. By the early 1900s the art scene in Budapest had changed and dispersed. Thankfully though, much of Epreskert’s Belle Époque charm has been preserved by the University of Fine Arts. The garden is only open to the public at particular times, such as during year-end exhibitions when modern art students display their work among the same mulberry bushes as the masters of the 19th century.  The garden can only be visited at select times."
67,The Golden Eagle Pharmacy Museum,"Budapest, Hungary",A Hungarian pharmacy museum with a box full of mummy powder.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golden-eagle-pharmacy-museum,"What began as a private collection of pharmaceutical oddities in 1896 became a museum in 1948. Called a collection of “Historical Chemist Relics,” it is better described as an alchemy museum. Among the curious items in this small museum is a bottle of Ambra Grisea Malac (Ambergris, or Sperm Whale vomit), for use on “Lean, thin, emaciated persons who take cold easily” and those who “with great sadness, sit for days weeping.” Besides the hanging bats, lizards and crocodiles, worth looking for is the box of mumia or mummy powder. Easily spotted by the decaying head on top, it is what it sounds like: the powder is made of ground-up mummies meant to be eaten or applied as a salve. All of which was the result of a poor translation. The Arabs were very fond of using Bitumen (a tar like substance) in their medicine. It bubbled up from the ground in the mountains of Persia and was an excellent way to staunch wounds. They called this stuff mumia. After the Arabs invaded Egypt, they also began calling those cloth wrapped bodies the Ancient Egyptians left laying everywhere mumia as well. They thought the bodies were prepared with bitumen, like the Greeks and Romans embalmed their dead (in fact they weren’t; the Egyptian mummies were prepared with a natural salt.) In the twelfth century, aided by the crusades, and a poor translation by Gerard of Cremona, it was decided that bitumen and mumia were one and the same. The black stuff came from mummies, and mummies were prepared in the black stuff, so you could use one for the other. By the 1400s the mummy trade was in full effect. Mummy powder was being used for everything from epilepsy to upset stomaches. Of course, mummies are rather hard to come by. The entire stock of thousands of mummies (likely the Guanche aristocracy) found on Canary Island was used up in a matter of years. Merchants even began making new mummies to satisfy the demands. They would buy the recently deceased, stuff them full of herbs and leave them out to dry. By the 1600s mummies were big business and everyone who was anyone used it. Francis Bacon loved it, so did Francis I of France. Shakespeare wrote about it in Othello and Macbeth, while his son-in-law John Hall prescribed it to his ill patients. The mummy trade eventually slowed mainly due to a tightening of Egyptian government on the practice, and the ever more difficult process of finding and smuggling authentic mummies. Mummy was still available in the catalog of Merck as late as 1908: “Genuine Egyptian mummy, as long as the supply lasts, 17 marks 50 per kilogram.” The jar of mumia at the Golden Eagle Pharmacy Museum is a rare little reminder of this past."
