0,Cactus Dome,Marshall Islands,An enormous concrete structure built over a nuclear crater.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cactus-dome,"Between 1946 and 1962, the U.S. military conducted 105 atmospheric nuclear tests over the “Pacific Proving Grounds,” a euphemism for the Marshall Islands and several other nearby South Pacific atolls. In the late 1970s, in an effort to clean up the radioactive debris left by those explosions, the government dug up 111,000 cubic yards of soil from the Bikini and Rongelap atolls and deposited it on Runit Island. Its resting place would be in a 350-foot wide crater that had been created two decades earlier by an 18-kiloton nuclear test code-named Cactus. Covering up that giant radioactive pit cost the government nearly a quarter of a billion dollars and took three years to complete. The result: an enormous, foot-and-a-half-thick, 100,000-square-foot dome consisting of 358 gigantic concrete panels. Despite signs warning off visitors, it is still possible to make landfall on Runit and stomp across the Cactus Dome. It is recommended that you don’t."
1,Bikini Atoll,Marshall Islands,"The birthplace of both the Atomic Age and Godzilla, and the namesake of the bathing suit.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bikini-atoll,"Bikini Atoll is a Micronesian Island chain located about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, and is what should be a heavenly place on Earth. However, its residents were forcibly relocated when the United States took possession of the islands in 1946, and over the next 12 years, the country sent 23 nuclear bombs raining down on this slice of paradise. From the air, Bikini is pristine and beautiful. The plant life has regrown unchecked since the explosions and is lush and green. Some visible remains of houses, towns, and graveyards give the illusion that civilization still exists on the land, in addition to a small research station maintained by the Department of Energy. The coral reefs have also been reborn and the large lagoon is inviting and clear. During the first practical test of a hydrogen bomb at Bikini, 23 members of a Japanese fishing boat crew that were supposedly at a safe distance were contaminated by the blast, and the scandal that rocked the nation was epic. It eventually became the inspiration for the movie Godzilla, in which a radioactive monster rises from an American nuclear test and attacks Japan. In 1968, the US prematurely deemed the islands safe, and let residents return to their homes. But contamination levels remained dangerous, and they had to be removed yet again. Under the clear lagoon, are the remains of nearly a dozen ships sunk during Operation Crossroads in 1946, and it’s possible and safe—though quite expensive—to visit and dive on the wrecks, including an aircraft carrier, a battleship. and more. The island itself is safe to visit as well, but avoid eating the coconuts."
2,WWII Plane Wreckage,Marshall Islands,A war relic that has sat undisturbed since it crash-landed near Arno Atoll.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wwii-plane-wreckage,"Those willing to venture off the beaten path will be rewarded by a stunning view of a World War II airplane wreckage. En route, visitors will have to drive across an abandoned landing strip from WWII. Locals insist that all the passengers walked away from the crash, and they are more than happy to regale tourists with other stories about the war.  Visiting this unparalleled site is not for the faint of heart. It requires a two-hour boat ride from Majuro to Arno Atoll and then an hour-long drive from the dock in Arno village to Japo Village. This site can be reached by walking out on a rocky point or swimming and snorkeling out to it. Divers can hire a boat and equipment to explore the wreckage and other relatively untouched dive sites that are farther out in the atoll's lagoon."
3,Nan Madol Ruins,Micronesia,The ruins of a South Pacific island city are spectacular and strange enough to have inspired H.P. Lovecraft.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nan-madol,"Off the coast of a remote Micronesian island lay the ruins of a once-great city of man-made stone islands that represent the remains of megalithic architecture on an unparalleled scale in Micronesia—and inspired the city of R’lyeh in H. P. Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos. Evidence of the earliest human activity dates back to the first or second century BC. The construction of artificial islets started probably about 8th and 9th century AD. However, the megalithic structures were built in period of 12th to 13th century, about the same time as the stone construction of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, or Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The complex of Nan Madol is constructed on a series of artificial islets in the shallow water next to the eastern shore of the Pohnpei island. The site encloses an area approximately 1.5 km long by 0.5 km wide and it contains nearly 100 artificial islets. Nan Madol seems to have housed the ruling elite caste of Saudeleur dynasty. It was a political and ceremonial seat of power. As a means of control of their subjects Saudeleur dynasty had succeeded in uniting the clans of Pohnpei. The rulers forced local chieftains to leave their home villages and move to the city where their activities could be more closely observed. Most of the islets served as residential area, however some of them served special purpose, such as food preparation, coconut oil production or canoe construction. Madol Powe, the mortuary sector, contains 58 islets in the northeastern area of Nan Madol. The centerpiece of the whole complex is the royal mortuary at the islet of Nandauwas, with its 7.5m high walls surrounding the central tomb enclosure. The population of Nan Madol was probably more than 1000 at a time when whole population of Pohnpei barely reached 25,000. There are no sources of fresh water or possibilities to grow food on Nan Madol so all supplies had to be brought in from the mainland. The population of the city probably included a large number of commoner servants. Nan Madol is the biggest center of the culture which left numerous other megalithic structures scattered on neighboring shores and on main island of Pohnpei; it all can be found in the area of about 18 square kilometers. According to local legend, the stones used in the construction of Nan Madol have been flown to the location by means of black magic. Archeologists have located several possible quarry sites on the main island, however the exact method of transportation of construction material is still not determined. Lovecraft used the story of the ruins as the basis for his R’lyeh, a fictional sunken city and home to Cthulhu, appearing in the short story “Call of Cthulhu”: “The nightmare corpse-city of R’lyeh … was built in measureless eons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults … until the end.” The real island of Pohnpei is also mentioned in the story. Nan Madol had been abandoned by the time the first Europeans arrived, early in the 19th century, most likely declining at the time of the fall of the Saudeleur Dynasty in about 1450. Some have claimed that the ruins are the lost islands of Lemuria, although there is no scientific backing for this claim (or, for that matter, for the existence of Lemuria at all).  United Airlines offers an island-hopper flight to Pohnpei, which goes east to west on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and west to east on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday."
4,Ghost Fleet of Truk Lagoon,Micronesia,Tropical paradise strewn with hundreds of World War II wrecks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ghost-fleet-of-truk-lagoon,"For two days in 1944, Allied bombers rained destruction on the beaches of the Caroline Islands in the South Pacific. During World War II, the lagoon was host to Japan’s Imperial Fleet, which was left destroyed in the wake of Operation Hailstone, often referred to as Japan’s Pearl Harbor. Today, hundreds of Japanese aircraft and other military machines remain at the bottom of the lagoon, making it one of the world’s best World War II wreck dive sites. The islands were once part of the Spanish West Indies, explored by Magellan and later visited by Spanish merchants and missionaries. The low coral islands are surrounded by a remarkable, sheltered reef—ideal for housing a navy. On February 17, 1944, five fleet carriers and four light carriers, along with support ships and some 500 aircraft, descended on the islands in a surprise attack. Just a week before the attack, the Japanese military had moved additional ships to the area, and, as a result, approximately 250 Japanese aircraft were destroyed and more than 50 ships sunk. An estimated 400 Japanese soldiers were killed in one ship alone, trapped in the cargo hold. Most of the fleet remains in exactly the same spot it was left, largely forgotten by the world until the late 1960s. Jacques Cousteau’s 1969 film Lagoon of Lost Ships explored the wreck-littered lagoon, and many of the sunken ships were then still full of bodies. As wreck divers brought attention to the site, Japan began recovery efforts, and many bodies have been removed and returned to Japan for burial. A few, however, remain. Many of the wrecks are visible through the shallow, clear water, making it an accessible dive. The wrecks themselves can be very dangerous, not only because of ragged edges and tangles of cables but because of half-century old oil and fuel leaking into the water, creating a potentially dangerous situation. Up until the 1990s, the lagoon was known at Truk, but it is now called Chuuk. Many maps still show both names."
5,Parc Zoologique et Forestier Michel Corbasson (Zoological and Forest Park),"Nouméa, New Caledonia",The best place to encounter plants and animals that can only be found in New Caledonia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/parc-zoologique-et-forestier-michel-corbasson,"With its rich tropical biomes and geographic isolation, New Caledonia is home to thousands of unique plant and animal species. It is one of the world’s biodiveristy hotspots, meaning that it’s especially rich in endemic species, or those found nowhere else in the world. The Parc Zoologique et Forestier Michel Corbasson (Zoological and Forest Park) in Nouméa is the perfect place to get a feel for the endemic flora and fauna of this island nation in the South Pacific. Enjoy a stroll through the endemic species section of the park to get up close and personal with New Caledonian crows, giant geckos, goliath imperial pigeons and the flightless kagu. Walking through the kagu enclosure is a special experience—the birds are curious and will follow visitors around the boardwalk, carefully inspecting them. Many of the animal enclosures also list feeding times, giving you a chance to see park staff interact with the animals, and talk about the animals and their plight (many are endangered). The park has trails catering to a variety of interests including a quiet walk through a native forest where, if you’re lucky, you’ll see colorful birds and butterflies.  There is a small café at the entrance to the park where you can purchase a variety of sandwiches and salads to enjoy on the picnic benches amongst the peacocks. Make sure to bring cash as credit cards aren’t accepted at either the café or park entrance."
6,Jean Marie Tjibaou Cultural Center,"Nouméa, New Caledonia",Marvel of green building techniques that sings with the wind.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jean-marie-tjibaou-cultural-center,"Designed by Renzo Piano and opened in 1998, the Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Center (Centre Culturel Tjibaou) was built to mimic the villages of the local Kanak people. It is named in honor of Jean-Marie Tjibaou, who died in 1989 while leading a fight for freedom from the French government, and dedicated to exploring the culture of New Caledonia and the South Pacific. Although a wonder of modern architecture and green building innovations, it is also deeply connected with the area, from its exterior of local iroko wood to its utilization of traditional building techniques. The building was designed to “sing” as it vibrates with the strong ocean winds, which are also allowed through the building as natural ventilation, so that the center is not just in harmony with nature, but a part of it. The double layered exterior forces warm air up and out of the building. It was also created to be stable in violent winds and earthquakes. The huts of the Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Center contain a center for art, a museum, theatres, and a library."
7,Sentir de la Petite Cascade de Farino,"Farino, New Caledonia",This peaceful path through the jungle is surrounded by songbirds and complete with a waterfall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sentir-de-la-petite-cascade-de-farino,"This amazing trail is just a short walk from the parking area. Intrepid explorers can venture down this jungle pathway until they reach the waterfall at the path’s end. Located in the middle of the rainforest, the falls and trail are just a short drive from the administrative office of Farino. It’s a beautiful ride that offers some of the most amazing views of the island’s west coast. The more the 2- mile walk (3.6km round-trip) is an easy trek along a well-marked path. The path takes you deep into the rainforest and along the creek that flows from the bottom of the falls. It’s easy to spot a few of New Caledonia’s endemic bird species and lizards along the path.  The parking lot from where you begin the hike is located at Le Refuge de Farino (a campground with tent spaces and cabins). There are signs along the way from Farino pointing you in this direction."
8,Bonhomme de Bourail,"Bourail, New Caledonia",A beachside monolith shaped by years of waves crashing against hard quartz.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bonhomme-de-bourail,"The Bonhomme de Bourail is a striking rock formation, a monolith made of quartz, that protrudes from the sea on the south end of the Baie des Tortues (Turtle Bay). The rock formation’s name translates to “Gentleman of Bourail,” and was named for its resemblance to a man’s head with a hat on. Years of waves crashing upon this rock led to its unusual shape. But despite the durability of its material, the structure is surprisingly fragile. Another rock formation—La Roche Percée (The Pierced Rock), named for a hole in its base—could once be found nearby, but after a series of landslides, was destroyed in 2007. The lagoons surrounding New Caledonia are recognized for their outstanding biodiversity including corals, turtles, dugongs and whales. The exceptional importance of this region, including the Bourail Lagoon, has been recognized through its designation as a UNESCO world heritage site. The beach at Turtle Bay is in the center of three beaches with the Baie des Amoureaux (Bay of Lovers) to the northwest and the Plage de la Roche Percee (Roche Percee Beach) to the southeast. The Bonhomme de Bourail can be seen from a number of vantage points, including spots on the network of hiking trails which connect the three beaches. Turtle Bay is the perfect place to spend a relaxing day, or take advantage of the only surfing spot in New Caledonia with waves reaching up to 2.5 meters (8 feet). The beach is beautifully nestled in the forest covered hillside and is separated from the small parking area by a swath of New Caledonian pines. Turtle Bay a special place not only for its natural beauty, but also for the significance it has to the local indigenous populations, for whom this place is an important gateway to the kingdom of the dead."
9,Monument de Balade,"Balade, New Caledonia",An overgrown monument remembers 60 years of French control in New Caledonia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-de-balade,"This monument was erected in 1913 to mark 60 years since the French violently took possession of New Caledonia in 1853. Erected with much fanfare, the large pyramid-shaped monument sits atop a stone base on top of a small hill. Today, more than a hundred years later, the monument has fallen into obscurity. An overgrown path leads to the monument and the area where the monument sits is also overgrown with knee-high grasses. Today, few visit the area. Located on the far northeastern corner of Grande Terre, the largest island of New Caledonia, a few miles from the village of Balade along the RPN7 main road. The monument is easy to reach, as long as you know where to look. Adding to the difficulty of finding this monument is (1) it is not shown in Google Maps and (2) the sign at the nearby road marking the spot is easy to miss, because it is small and nearly overgrown.  The monument can be found at: -20.297345, 164.474412 It is located along the RPN7, just north of the road, about 2 miles (3 km) west of the Balade church, and about a third of a mile (600 meters) west of the turnoff to Maamaat beach. Search maps for ""Maamaat"". In maps, look for a small trail west of the Maamaat beach turnoff shaped like a circle. The monument is in the middle of that circle."
10,Hobbiton,"Matamata, New Zealand","The real life Hobbiton, this sheep farm has been forever transformed since being built for The Hobbit film series.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/real-life-shire-hobbiton,"Once an unassuming farm, this hillside will never be seen the same way again after being chosen to act as a set for “The Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit” films. Even before it was retrofitted with several Hobbit Holes to play the part of Hobbiton in Peter Jackson’s adaptations of the classic Tolkien book series, this sheep farm seemed like a perfect stand-in for the famous fictional “Shire,” home of hobbits everywhere. Indeed, its natural likeness is undoubtedly the reason Jackson and his producers chose the location—with the only other qualification being that it’s located in New Zealand, the unofficial real-life location of Tolkien’s Middle Earth. In September 1998, Sir Peter Jackson “discovered” the Alexander Farm during an aerial search for suitable film sites. Site construction started in March 1999. Filming The Lord of the Rings trilogy commenced in 1999 and lasted for three months. When the site was rebuilt for The Hobbit trilogy in 2009, these structures were built out of permanent materials. The entire reconstruction process took two years, yet filming The Hobbit trilogy began in October 2011 and took only 12 days. At its peak, 400 people were on-site, including Sir Peter Jackson, Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Bilbo Baggins, and young Bilbo Baggins. The farm is still an active sheep farm, but visitors can tour the area used for the set. Most of the Hobbit Holes are fenced off and you can’t enter them, but one is specifically designed for visitors to enter and explore. Tour guides are employed to explain where in the movies each area appears – Bag End is a highlight, along with The Green Dragon, a whimsical old-world pub. In fact, The Green Dragon is now open for business, and at the end of the tour, you can have a drink there. The set is very detailed and the hobbit holes are purposely made to look as though they have been there for years, complete with details like fake moss and many other small touches. There is laundry hanging, food displayed, salmon being smoked and other fish caught mimicking a very realistic set. The tree at Bag End is a fake tree intended to preserve the area’s appearance as it was in the film, even though the one featured in The Lord of the Rings was real. The film version was actually cut down and placed there for the movie. It died by the time they decided to film The Hobbit, so a fake tree with hand-painted leaves sits in its place, an exact replica of the original. The gorgeous location makes it easy to see why this was chosen for The Shire. The farm is in the middle of the countryside, still seemingly hidden from the modern world. A GPS is helpful in locating it since there aren’t really any signs directing you where to go.  Tours depart from 3 sites: The Shire’s Rest, Matamata i-SITE, and Rotorua. The Hobbiton tour includes walking through the Party Tree, the Party Field, Bilbo Baggins’ hobbit, Bag End, the Watermill, and finally finishing at The Green Dragon (a cafe), a complimentary cider, all handcrafted and exclusive to Hobbiton Movie Set, will be served. It’s 111 miles from Auckland to Hobbiton. Almost everyone that visits New Zealand rents a car or a motor home to explore. Given this, you do not need to organize your tour with a third-party service unless you need transportation to The Hobbiton Movie Set. In short, buy tickets directly from The Hobbiton Movie Set and drive to the location. Once you arrive, it’s private property, and then you do need to take a tour. You cannot get to The Hobbiton Movie Set yourself, nor can you see it from a distance. You must take the bus included in your ticket. Make sure that you purchase tickets in advance. They sell out daily."
11,Waitomo Glowworm Caves,"Waitomo, New Zealand",Tubing through a cave lit with glowworms is a magical underground experience.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/waitomo-glowworm-caves,"In 1887, English surveyor Fred Mace and local Maori Chief Tane Tinorau decided to explore the Caves of Waitomo. They entered the cave system on a tiny raft where a stream descends into the underground, and with their candles, they carefully navigated the stream through the caves. In the darkness, they noticed starlike lights scattered across the formations above their heads. Thousands of glowworms were hanging peacefully above their heads, forming a magnificent bioluminescent cosmos. The glowworm is a catch-all name for the bioluminescent larvae of various species. The larvae of the beetle fireflies (Lampyridae), beetle larvae (Phengodidae), and of Arachnocampa, a type of fungus gnat all bioluminescence. It is these fungus gnats that can be found in massive numbers in Waitomo caves. The fungus gnat larvae cling to rock walls and hunt with long strings of sticky mucus. When seen in large groups they are truly astounding. Elated with joy, the two men would return many times to explore further. On an independent trip, Tinorau found a land entrance, which is the same entrance that is used today by tourists from around the world. Tourists started visiting in 1889 when Tinorau and his wife began leading tours. Today, many cave guides are descendants of Tinorau and his wife, and the fungus gnats, with their long strings of sticky mucus, still glow beautifully.   You can buy single tickets for any of the caves, or you can buy a bundle. I strongly recommend you buy a package and see them all. Not only is this a more economical option, but all of the caves are worth seeing. It costs ~ 97ND to tour all three caves. All tickets include tours of the caves. You cannot self navigate the tours. Reservations are required, and numbers on each tour are restricted."
12,Milford Sound,"Milford Sound, New Zealand","Dolphins, ancient clams and hundreds of waterfalls make this one of the world's top tourist destinations.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/milford-sound,"Off the coast of New Zealand, in the Tasman Sea, huge granite cliffs rise 3,900 feet or more, and plunge 300-1500 feet under the surface of the water. These mountainous structures, carved by ancient glaciers, are the fjords of the Milford Sound. Milford Sound is home to some of the world’s most unique flora and fauna. Ancient clams called brachiopods are buried under the floor of the fjord, and have had no need to evolve for over 300 million years. The world’s largest population of black coral trees also lives under the surface. Related to sea anemones, the coral colonies’ lifespans are over 4000 years and they are among the oldest continuously living organisms on the planet. There are approximately seven million of the colonies in Milford Sound. Black coral trees can be seen through the Milford Discovery Centre and Underwater Observatory. Dolphins, New Zealand Fur Seals, and Fjordland Crested Penguins also frequent the waters. Lucky visitors will see the occasional whale that wanders into the fiord from the Tasman Sea. Dolphins swim alongside the Milford Sound Cruise Ships and show off for their guests. Groups of penguins pop in and out of the water, while the fur seals rest on the low rocks. The fjord gets over 20 feet of rainfall every year, feeding its two permanent waterfalls. Good weather is a bit of a long shot, but rains only serve to create hundreds of temporary waterfalls that sporadically appear on every cliff. If the sun does decide to peek out of the clouds, expect a rainbow at the bottom of every misty waterfall. Milford Sound is New Zealand’s most popular fjord, because it is the only one that can be reached by car. Milford Road is a steep five hour drive from Queenstown, but the determined traveller will find that the stunning scenery and Lord of the Rings landmarks make the journey as delightful as the destination.   The journey to Milford Sound will take at least 12 hours, including travel time and sightseeing. The best way to see the wildlife and take in the scenery is by taking the 1 ½-2 hour cruise through 16km of fiord. Kayaking is also a good way to get up close and personal to the wildlife. For more extreme visitors, there is scuba diving, base jumping, and mountain climbing. The only accommodation in Milford Sound is at the Milford Lodge."
13,Castle Hill,"Castle Hill, New Zealand","The Dalai Lama named this New Zealand landscape the ""Spiritual Center of the Universe.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/spiritual-center-of-the-universe,"New Zealand is known for its natural beauty, but in 2002 a particular patch of farmland was given a special honor. It became a “Spiritual Center of the Universe.” Called Castle Hill, the area is a high country station—a station is a large farm area dedicated to the grazing of sheep and cattle—on New Zealand’s South Island. Looking like the ruins of a castle, and hence the name, the hill is a popular climbing and bouldering spot for rock climbers. But rock climbers aren’t the only ones impressed by the site. In 2002, the Dalai Lama visited the South Island. Apparently, he didn’t like the energy in the nearby town of Christchurch (whose church is made from rock quarried from the boulders) and he was taken to the boulder field. He was so taken by the landscape, and his spiritual experience there he named the area a “Spiritual Center of the Universe.” The area got some world exposure when the nearby Flock Hill station was used for the filming of the climactic battle scenes of the 2005 movie The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.  The hill is located at an altitude of 700 metres, close to State Highway 73 between Darfield and Arthur's Pass. It is on private property."
14,That Wanaka Tree,"Wanaka, New Zealand","A solitary tree has grown up all alone on Lake Wānaka, backdropped by the beautiful Southern Alps.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lone-tree-of-lake-wanaka,"Framed by the South Island’s stunning Southern Alps, a lonely tree has grown up to spread its wings just off shore at the south end of Lake Wānaka. Known as the “lone tree of Lake Wānaka,” it is said to be one of the most photographed trees in all New Zealand. However, you still need to have the inside scoop to find it, as there are no signs directing people to the solitary tree. It’s just enough off of the beaten path to not be bothered by too many tourists unless they’ve done their research. Walking along the lake to find the lone tree is a beautiful sight. When you arrive, you’ll find beach access on the shore just a stone’s throw away from the tree, the perfect place to have a picnic and watch the sun set or rise. If you can stand the cold but refreshing water of Lake Wānaka, swimming is a great way to awaken the senses. The lone tree is right at the foothills of Mount Aspiring National Park, a World Heritage Site, acting as a doorway into even more of the breathtaking landscapes that embody the South Island of New Zealand. Try visiting when the sun is low on the horizon and there’s an abundance of colorful low light, rather than the view being bleached out by the midday sun. At this time of day you’re also more likely to find the lone tree of Lake Wānaka, all alone.  The easiest way to access this iconic tree is via a car park located just a two minute walk away. This car park is found at the start of the Waterfall Creek Track."
15,The Tree Church,"Ohaupo, New Zealand",One man's dream has turned into this naturally growing chapel made of almost nothing but trees.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tree-church-ohaupo-new-zealand,"Many people see the face of God in the beauty of nature, but few have ever taken this to the extent of Barry Cox, the infinitely patient creator of New Zealand’s Tree Church. According to his website, Cox has long appreciated the beauty of churches he has seen across the world during his travels, and finally decided to create one of his own. Cox runs a service that safely uproots trees using a truck mounted scoop called a “tree spade,” and replants them elsewhere. Using his preexisting equipment and know-how, Cox began planting a variety of trees on his land to form portions of the church, each chosen for a different quality. For instance, the walls were planted with leptospernums for their color, and the roof was created using cut leaf alders for their sparse canopy that would allow the natural light into the space. The project began in 2011, and the planted trees were delicately trained across an iron frame until they began to grow together to shape the gabled form of the church. The church has continued to grow over the years and is now almost completely formed, although the iron frame remains, waiting for the day when the structure will be sturdy enough to stand on its own. Today the Tree Church is open for weddings and events, and can seat up to a hundred guests. Cox’s grounds also include green garden walks and a medieval-style labyrinth. Outdoor weddings are always a gamble, but at least this one provides a roof either way.  The Tree Church is open to the public on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Groups and private events are arranged by appointment only. Admissions $20 per adult, children under 14 $10, children under 5 no cost."
16,Devil's Bath,"Waiotapu, New Zealand",This electric green sulphur lake in New Zealand looks like a cartoonish radioactive dump site.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devil-s-bath,"The Wai-O-Tapu Wonderland in New Zealand is home to a number of roiling, bubbling geothermal sights, but possibly the most intriguing is one of its most calm. Known as the Devil’s Bath, this neon green pool of stagnant stink water is a natural wonder. Between geysers and colorfully steaming mud bogs, the Wai-O-Tapu volcanic era offers no shortage of wondrous attractions. The Devil’s Bath may not have as many active reactions as other features in the vicinity, but it is still the most eye-catching (and the most intriguingly named). The pool sits in a slight depression likely created from a massive eruption from underground. It is well out of reach of visiting gawkers but can be seen clearly from above. The bright green water gets its color from deposits of sulphur that rise to the surface and float on top. The green identifies that active mineral while other hues found across the park such as blues, reds, and otherwise signify other volcanic elements. The origin of the demonic monicker is unknown, but given how unnatural the pool looks, it would almost come as no surprise to see Satan himself rise from the still lake. Despite the name and almost frightening display of geothermal chemistry, the Devil’s Bath and all of the volcanic craziness in the area are a favorite attraction for traveling families looking to show their kids how bizarre and unnatural nature can look."
17,Lake Tekapo,"Lake Tekapo, New Zealand",A perfect turquoise lake colored with glacier dust.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-tekapo-south-island-new-zealand,"In a large basin, combine 100 parts water with one part glacier-formed rock dust. Mix over millions of years and allow to settle until humankind inhabits South Island, New Zealand. This simple recipe has created a beauty so rare and a landscape so striking it deflates your lungs within moments of arriving at its shores. Lake Tekapo is an idyllic alpine spot at the foot of Mt. John, on the South Island of New Zealand. The color of the lake’s water truly sets it apart from other lakes. It’s a beautiful turquoise blue is a product of the surrounding glaciers. The glaciers in the headwaters of Lake Tekapo grind rocks into a fine dust on their journey down towards the lake. The resulting particulate, called “rock flour,” is suspended in the water and causes the magnificent turquoise. The amazing color of the lake set against the backdrop of snow-capped peaks and fields of wildflowers makes Lake Tekapo an extraordinarily dramatic landscape. The best views can be had from the top of Mt. John, which is home to University of Canterbury’s Mt. John Observatory.  Buses are available from Christchurch and Queenstown, along with a number of smaller cities on the South Island"
18,Tunnel Beach,"Dunedin, New Zealand",Known for the tunnel that leads visitors to the water.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tunnel-beach,"A locality nearly five miles southwest of the Dunedin, New Zealand, Tunnel Beach is famous for the tunnel that leads visitors down to the beach. Commissioned by local politician, John Cargill, son of Captain William Cargill, in the 1870s, the tunnel is the primary draw, but not the only draw, of the area, which is also known for the beauty of its rugged sandstone cliffs, rock arches, and caves. To reach the beach today, visitors must trek across private farmland. The path, which was opened in 1983, descends from about 500 feet above sea level and is located just a short distance from Blackhead Road. The path winds its way to the top of the tunnel, which then leads guests down 72 steps to the beach. The tunnel is a bit spooky. Naturally lit, the tunnel is quite dark and if you speak at a low enough pitch while inside of it, it resonates loudly from one end to the other. From SH1, South Dunedin, follow the Southern Scenic Route sign to Blackhead Road. Turn on to Green Island Bush Road and stop at the carpark. Follow the fenced track downhill to the spectacular, rocky coastline. At the end of the track a short tunnel with steps leads down to the beach. This track crosses private land. Please respect the landowner’s property and livestock."
19,Fox Glacier,"Fox Glacier, New Zealand",A glacier pocked with ice caves and surrounded by rainforests.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fox-glacier,"The 8.1 miles of the Fox Glacier in New Zealand’s Westland Tai Poutini National Park form an ever-transforming terrain of ice caves and glacial terminal that is bordered on all sides by rainforests and mountains. Along with its neighbor Franz Josef Glacier, it’s one of the world’s most accessible glaciers for exploring, and regular guided tours are available. The glacier has been advancing since 1985 after decades of retreating, and with all the movement and melting stunning ice caves have been revealed. However, gorgeous as it is, solo wandering is not allowed as there is a danger of ice breaks and rockfalls that in the past have proved fatal. You must take a tour; you can not access it without either flying on a plane that can land on ice or land with helicopter. The hike to the viewing point is easy and it's still impressive. Highly recommended is a better view of the glacier via the Viewing Point, past the carpark."
20,Te Waikoropupu Springs,"Takaka, New Zealand",Some of the clearest water anywhere in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pupu-springs,"Located in Golden Bay on New Zealand’s South Island, the Te Waikoropupu Springs (“Pupu Springs”) are known for both the clarity of the water they hold and the volume of water discharged. The horizontal visibility of the water in the area has been measured at an average of 63 meters, which is a world record for fresh water. This value, verified using specialist optical instruments, approaches the theoretical maximum for optically pure water. The springs are notable for the volume of water discharged from the eight main vents, ranking among the largest in the world. It is estimated that 14,000 liters of water are produced per second, approximately enough to fill 40 bathtubs. In a 1974 television documentary, it was noted that this would be enough water to supply a city the size of Boston, Massachusetts. The floor of the lake is covered with white sand. Waters expelled from some of the smaller vents carry the sand upward. These vents are known as the dancing sands, which for the few scuba divers who have secured permission to dive in the springs, is one of the highlights of underwater sightseeing. At the entrance to the walkway to the springs, the Department of Conservation in New Zealand has placed a sign: “Te Waikoropupu Springs are a taonga (treasure) and waahi tapu (a sacred place) for Māori, both locally and nationally. The legends of Te Waikoropupu are told in the stories of Huriawa, its taniwha (guardian spirit). In Māori tradition the Springs are wairou, the purest form of water which is the wairua (spiritual) and the physical source of life. The Springs provide water for healing, and in the past were a place of ceremonial blessings at times of birth and death and the leaving and returning of travelers.”  Head out of west out of Takaka and you will the sign. You can't miss it!"
21,Gibbs Farm,"Makarau, New Zealand",A gigantic sculpture garden is packed with innovative oddities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gibbs-farm,"In 1991, entrepreneur and art collector Alan Gibbs purchased a piece of property on New Zealand’s North Island that has now come to be known as Gibbs Farm. Immediately following his purchase, Gibbs knew that the property would eventually grow to become the world’s ultimate meeting place of giant sculptures and rolling farmland. Over the past 25 years, Gibbs has hired 22 renowned sculptors from around the world to construct towering abstract sculptures atop the rolling hills of the 1,000-acre plot. Every month, the farm is open to the public for one day, in which visitors will have the ultimate chance to witness the unique adaptation of innovative sculptures to an outdoor environment. Perhaps one of the most famous sculptures on Gibbs Farm is Neil Dawson’s “Horizons,” which resembles a giant piece of corrugated iron atop a hill. While it may appear to be a computer-generated cartoon, astoundingly, Horizons is a real sculpture made of welded and painted steel, and it fits in perfectly with the cow-filled agricultural landscape of the farm. Also found on Gibbs Farm is Sol LeWitt’s “Pyramid,” a cluster of concrete blocks that form a perfect staircase for the sheep of the property. Anish Kapoor’s “Dismemberment” sculpture is a humungous tube with open ends on both sides, nestled in a slight dip in the farm’s rolling hills. Perhaps one of the most ingenious creations found at Gibbs Farm is the Electrum, the world’s largest Tesla coil, standing at four stories tall. On a leisurely walk through Gibbs Farm, visitors will be treated to an array of multi-story paper clips, a forest of 100 giant vertical lights, a bridge made out of cubes, a field of multi-colored squares, and even a life-sized, incredibly-realistic giraffe. Although Gibbs Farm is rarely open to the public and is little-known worldwide, it is truly one of New Zealand’s best-kept secret gems."
22,Te Wairoa Buried Village,"Lake Tarawera, New Zealand",A Maori village obliterated by an 1886 volcanic eruption.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/te-wairoa-buried-village,"When Mount Tarawera erupted in June, 1889 the surrounding countryside was completely remade. New Zealand’s largest volcanic eruption killed over 100 people and created an entirely new landscape of steaming fumaroles, boiling mud, and deadly hot springs all inside the new caldera. The village of Te Wairoa was established in 1848 by Christian missionaries as a model village. Sixty years after the eruption of Tarawera, the Smith family purchased the land and began excavating, looking for the remains of the lost village Today visitors can explore the 12-acre site including the excavated village, museum, and a reconstruction of a pioneer era cottage. Miraculously, the meeting house known as Hinemihi survived along with those who took shelter beneath its roof. In 1891 the meeting house was purchased for £50 and transported to England, where it remains at Clandon Park in Surrey to this day."
23,Slope Point,"Slope Point, New Zealand","The most southerly spot on New Zealand's South Island is home to surreally shaped, permanently mangled trees.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/slope-point,"Slope Point, the most southerly spot on New Zealand’s South Island, is perched upon rugged cliffs that dip into the sea. Cold winds tear through the air, battering the land and all that grows upon it. The weather is so fierce that the whipping winds have left a patch of trees weirdly warped. The tangled trees stretch sideways rather than upwards. They’re bent at odd angles, their branches permanently coiffed to the side like a permanent, ill-advised hairdo. Sheep farmers planted the trees to give their flocks shelter from the wild weather. Cold air whirls around the Antarctic Ocean uninterrupted, causing the winds to gain immense strength before hurling themselves at whatever objects they first encounter. The trees struggled to bear the brunt of the windy assault, causing them to bend northward. On a pleasant day, beams of sunlight spotlight the gnarled knot, giving it the appearance of a surreal piece of art. Against the ominous gray skies of a drearier visit, the mangled mass seems almost sinister. Slope Point is a beautiful place to explore. Green pastureland stretches toward the horizon, leading to the rocky cliffs that plunge into the water below. The place is sparsely habitated, apart from the sheep that dot the landscape. A sign by the road gestures toward Slope Point. You’ll know you’re there when you come across a canary yellow sign that gives the distance between your location, the South Pole, and the Equator. GPS coordinates lead to the Slope Point sign. Public access is prohibited during lambing season."
24,Waipu Caves,"Waipu, New Zealand",A galaxy of glowworms—larvae of a gnat—hides deep in the belly of these caves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/waipu-caves,"A glowing treasure awaits within the heart of these caves. Explorers willing to wade through waist-deep water and trudge through the mud in utter blackness will reach a cavern twinkling with the soft blue light of glowworms. The Waipu Caves on New Zealand’s North Island are a great (free!) alternative to the famous Waitomo Glowworm Caves, which are rather expensive and can get really busy. This off-the-beaten-track option is unregulated and unguided, giving the whole adventure a more rugged feel. Venture through the first chamber to gaze in awe at the stalactites and stalagmites. Once your eyes have adjusted, be sure to scan the dank chamber to search for any animal bones or invertebrate fossils hiding in plain sight within the darkness. This first, roomy cave is only the start of the adventure. You then must follow the stream through the second chamber and into the third, clambering up slick mud banks along the way. Only there, once you’ve descended deep into the belly of the cave passage, will you find the galaxy of glowworms dangling from the ceiling.  The Waipu caves are unregulated and unguided, which means visitors are responsible for their own safety (check the weather a week before going and never explore alone). The caves are wet and slippery, and sometimes you'll need to wade through water up to waist-height. The inner chambers are suitable for experienced cavers only. Sinkholes are common and correct footwear and a head torch are necessary. Turn off all lights to make the most of the glow worms. Please respect the local area and take all rubbish home with you. There is a shower and toilets in the car park near the caves to clean your gear (and yourself, if you wish)."
25,Electrum,"Kaukapakapa, New Zealand",One of the world's largest Tesla coils.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/electrum,"Tesla coils have always played a special role in denoting the “mad” scientist. Created by that great icon of mad science himself, Nikola Tesla, the coils have long been beloved by high-voltage hobbyists. One of the world’s largest Tesla coil, however, was commissioned neither as a work of science nor as a movie prop, but as a work of art. Known as Electrum, this four-story (38-foot) Tesla coil was commissioned by a prominent New Zealand art patron, Alan Gibbs, and set up on his farm outside of Auckland in April of 1998. Built by the late artist Eric Orr and high-voltage engineer Greg Leyh, the enormous coil puts out over 3 million volts, enough to rip electrons out of the air molecules around it. A particular delight of Electrum is the hollow spherical cage on top of it, where Greg Leyh often sits during discharge shows. The arcs from the coil would instantly kill anyone they struck, but Leyh is safe within the Faraday cage created by the sphere. Of course, if he were to put his hand in the cage, he would be instantly electrocuted. Though Electrum is the largest coil currently in existence, it is not the biggest ever created. That title belongs to an 18-story coil built-in 1903 by Nikola Tesla himself at Wardenclyffe on Long Island. Unfortunately, it was torn down due to a lack of funding before it was ever fully operational. But Leyh, the co-creator of Electrum, has plans to resurrect Tesla’s dream of a giant coil — times two. Under the project name “Lightning on Demand,” or LOD, Leyh has purchased 81 acres in the Nevada desert where he plans to build twin 118-foot-tall Tesla coils, which would be big enough to generate 10-million-volt lightning arcs that would stretch across an area the size of a football field. Having built a pair of 1:12 scale (still almost 10 feet tall) coils as a proof of concept, Leyh is waiting for funding to help bring his electrical dream to life. Other large Tesla coils currently in action include the Viziv tower in Milford, Texas, “BIGGG” Tesla coil in Oklahoma, Big Bruiser in Wisconsin, and a pair of coils known as CAUAC that make an appearance at the annual Coachella music festival. A number of large coils can also be seen at the yearly Teslathon gatherings.  Check Gibbs Farm website for visitor dates. The Gibbs Farm is open only few days a month and booking in advance is required."
26,Jellyfish Lake,"Koror, Palau",An isolated dive site teeming with cnidarians.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jellyfish-lake,"Located on an uninhabited rock island off the coast of Koror in Palau, Jellyfish Lake is one of 70 saltwater lakes on this South Pacific archipelago that were once connected to the ocean, but are now cut off. The isolated lakes became the perfect setting for a jellyfish explosion, which some speculate were trapped in the lake 12,000 years ago after a rise in sea levels post-Ice Age. The jellyfish, which munch on algae and have no natural predators present, fill the little lake. Though the jellyfish do have stingers, they are too small to be felt by humans. You can swim in the lake, but you can’t scuba dive, as that may disturb the delicate ecosystem. The lake is stratified into two layers, the upper one being richer with oxygen and less saline, and it’s a more suitable environment for organisms like jellyfish, copepods, and some species of fish. Also, you will want to stay away from the lower dangerous layer of hydrogen sulfide that hovers between 15 and 20 meters deep. During the day, the jellyfish migrate from the west side to the east side of the lake to follow the path of the sun, which feeds the algae they survive on.  Trips have been temporarily discontinued due to environmental conditions."
27,Badrulchau Stone Monoliths,Palau,These ancient monoliths make up one of the largest archaeological sites in Palau.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/badrulchau-stone-monoliths,"Possibly the largest and oldest archaeological site in Palau, the Badrulchau Stone Monoliths can be found on the hill slopes at the northernmost point of Babeldaob Island. The site consists of 52 basalt megaliths lined up in two rows, crude faces carved into some of them. Archaeologists estimate its construction dates back to around the year 161. The purposes of these stone monuments have been a question, but it is believed that they served as pillars for a bai, a type of traditional Palauan meeting-house. According to legends, this bai was constructed by the gods and could house thousands of people at one time. If that is the case, the monoliths may be the remains of the largest bai ever built. If you’re fond of Pacific history, archaeological mysteries, and a spectacular view of the sea, you will enjoy this hidden treasure of ruins.  Badrulchau is located in Ngarchelong State on Babeldaob Island. The entrance and ticket office are located on a small hill, beneath which the Monoliths can be found."
28,Talasea Airstrip,"Talasea, Papua New Guinea",Two World War II aircraft lie within the jungle around this abandoned runway.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/talasea-airstrip,"The South Pacific is littered with relics leftover from World War II. Military tunnels snake beneath tiny towns. Planes and equipment lie sunken beneath the water, cloaked in coral. Dense tangles of jungle hold more forgotten wartime treasures, like this abandoned airfield. Originally built by the Australian army as a small landing strip, Talasea was occupied by both the Japanese and Americans during the second World War, changing hands between them. Too small to accommodate fighter planes, the airfield was used as an emergency landing strip in the later part of the war. In early September 1944, the landing strip saw its final pieces of action. On September 3, 1944, an American B-25H bomber took off from Stirling Island with the objective of locating and destroying any remaining Japanese ships of the South Coast of New Britain. While the mission was a success, the B-25H aircraft incurred engine trouble, and rather than risk the flight back to its base, the captain made the decision to make an emergency landing at Talasea. In a similar mission less than a week later, a Lockheed Ventura was dispatched to bomb a Japanese-occupied airstrip near Rabaul. The Lockheed’s mission was successful, but one engine failed on the return journey. As the crew knew the plane wouldn’t make it all the way back to base, they too made the decision to land at Talasea. Shortly after the war ended, the airstrip at Talasea was abandoned. Palm oil plantations sprung up around Talasea in the 1960s, and nature gradually encroached around the planes. Today, the airstrip is virtually unrecognizable from its former runway glory. The land still holds tidbits of its wartime past, however, as both the B-25 bomber and Lockheed remain in their final resting places. While exploring on foot, make your way through the overgrown bush, and you’ll reach the B-25H bomber, resting on its undercarriage atop a bed of lush greenery. Fewer than 40 yards to the west lies the Lockheed Ventura. With the Allied star still barely visible on its side, you can still walk inside the plant-filled undercarriage and imagine the tight spaces where the pilots and crew would have sat.  Only reachable by 4x4 vehicle, there is nothing more than a cutaway path through the forest that takes you high up onto the incline that was once the landing strip. Land tours to the planes are available from Walindi Plantation Resort."
29,The Tunnels of Rabaul,"Rabaul, Papua New Guinea",This volcanically volatile island town is home to an abandoned series of tunnels left by the Japanese during WWII.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tunnels-of-rabaul-rabaul-papua-new-guinea,"Home to two active volcanoes and some of the most abundant earthquake activity in the world, the township of Rabaul in Papua New Guinea does not seem to be the ideal place for a massive military encampment. But thanks to a strategically significant harbor, the Japanese built one anyway during World War II, leaving behind over 500 miles of tunnels snaking beneath the island when they were routed. Japanese forces overtook the town of Rabaul in 1942 as WWII was in its final years, and quickly established a massive military complex serving their navy, air force, and, infantry. At its height, the Rabaul base and its surrounding encampment served over 97,000 soldiers and thousands more accompanying personnel. Due to the island’s remote location, the main threat to the base was bombardment from the air, which was frequent and often devastating. To counteract this, hundreds of miles of tunnels were built beneath the town where a number of fully functioning facilities were installed. The tunnels were dug by laborers who were captured in Malaysia, China, and Singapore and transported to Rabaul. Many of these laborers died from disease, starvation, poor treatment, and overwork. The Japanese also used local Tolai labor from surrounding villages and prisoners of war. The hospital, barracks, storehouses, and command centers were moved into the underground labyrinth with some of the chambers built as large as four stories tall. Some of the tunnels were hewn right from the existing rock, and some were crude structures supported by palm beams, while others still were fully built out concrete bunkers. All in all, the system became one of the longest and most elaborate in the world. When the Japanese were driven from the island at the end of the war, the base and its copious tunnels were simply left behind. Today, most of the contents of the base have been cleared out but dangerous ammunition and other remnants can still be found in the depths of the tunnels. A volcanic eruption in 1994 nearly buried the entire city beneath volcanic ash and most of the populace were forced to evacuate, but the area is slowly recovering and the tunnels beneath the island are slowly being rediscovered."
30,Christian's Cafe,"Adamstown, Pitcairn Islands",The cafe that acts as the social hub for the small volcanic island of HMS Bounty fame.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/christian-s-cafe-pitcairn-island,"Located on the most remote inhabited island in the world, Christian’s Cafe is a quaint cafe and bar in a town built by ruthless pirates. Settled in 1790 by a mix of Tahitian islanders and the crew of the famous hijacked ship the H.M.S. Bounty, Pitcairn Island is home to a small population who carve out a living on the small volcanic island. Christian’s bar is the weekly social hall.   Due to the island’s historic moral laws, which previously required a permit to purchase or consume alcohol, Christian’s Cafe actually only began serving alcohol freely after 2009. Since the prohibitions on the island have been relaxed to encourage tourism, the lone cafe bar sees travelers on ten-day or three-day passes and even some guests from passing cruise ships.The establishment itself is a large, white room with a gorgeous view of Pitcairn’s lush tropical foliage, providing a relaxing atmosphere in which to imbibe with the locals. The island has only 50 aging inhabitants and very little import of goods, so the bar hours are kept relatively short, opening only after 6:30pm on Fridays, but if you can find a way to make it to the island it is your best bet for mixing it up with the historic island’s locals."
31,Wreck of HMS Bounty,"Adamstown, Pitcairn Islands",The watery grave of Captain Bligh's famous ship.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wreck-of-hms-bounty,"“I am now unhappily to relate one of the most atrocious acts of Piracy ever committed… Christian… then said—‘Come captain Bligh, your officers and men are now in the boat, and you must go with them; if you attempt to make the least resistance you will instantly be put to death:’ and without any further ceremony, holding me by the cord that tied my hands, with a tribe of armed ruffians about me, I was forced over the side… A few pieces of pork were now thrown to us, and some cloaths, also… cutlasses… We were at length cast adrift in the open ocean.” -Captain William Bligh In April of 1789, Captain William Bligh lost control of his ship in one of the most famous mutinies in history. The men of HMS Bounty, sent from England in search of breadfruit two years earlier, were tired, they were sick of Bligh’s tough command style, and mostly, they really, really wanted to go back to Tahiti. 18 men overpowered the captain, threatened his life, and set him adrift on a small boat with 18 loyal men. There began one of the most extraordinary stories of seafaring endurance and survival, in which Bligh and his men, powered perhaps by a desire for righteous revenge, navigated 3,618 nautical miles over 47 days and arrived in Timor to report the mutiny. Only one man did not make it - a sailor by the name of John Norton was stoned to death by natives during an unsuccessful attempt to make landfall for provisions on the remote Tofua Island. Meanwhile, the mutineers set out to establish their life of ease on Tubuai, Tahiti, and Pitcairn Islands with their new native wives. In fear of detection, after settling on Pitcairn Island,  the mutineers burned the Bounty in the water, effectively trapping themselves in their new island paradise. What followed was anything but an idyllic life. The men fought and squabbled and succumbed to disease, they committed suicide, and they killed each other in cold blood. Eighteen years later, when Pitcairn and the mutineers were discovered by the ship Topaz, only one of the men was still alive. In 1957, photographer and explorer Luis Marden made the extraordinary discovery of the remains of the Bounty, still visible in shallow water off the shores of Pitcairn, more or less undisturbed for a century and a half. Although some artifacts from the wreck were removed, there are still remains that can be seen by divers willing to risk the dangerous swells of the bay. Other artifacts are on display at the community hall on Pitcairn. Elsewhere, you can pay your respects to Captain Bligh in London, where his tomb is topped with a carving of breadfruit."
32,To Sua Ocean Trench,"Apia, Samoa","The world is full of swimming holes, but few compare to Samoa’s idyllic To Sua ocean trench.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/to-sua-ocean-trench,"Over the course of millennia, erosion of the lava fields around Lotofaga left the area pocketed with tide pools and a series of blowholes, the largest of which is To Sua (whose name translates to “big hole”). The To Sua ocean trench is a swimmer’s delight, set on the edge of a tropical paradise with the South Pacific lapping at its shores. Surrounded by lush gardens, visitors wind along cliffside paths to the natural salt water pool sunken deep into the earth. The western side of the ocean trench opens onto a small, sandy beach only accessible through a cave-like nook. Sheer rock faces of volcanic basalt disappear underfoot, leaving an epic ladder as the sole access point to the water below. Too impatient to descend slowly? While making a flying leap into the crystalline water may seem a poor choice, at 90 feet in depth, the salt water pool offers a perfectly safe opportunity for those bold enough to give it a go. Should acts of bravado prove less appealing, paddling the turquoise waters of an ocean trench while humming Bali Hai will likely make for just as memorable an experience.  The trench closes at 5 PM every day. It opens at 8:30 AM every day except Sunday, when it opens at 12:30 PM."
33,Alofaaga Blowholes,"Taga, Samoa",A site of natural wonder and flying coconuts in Samoa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alofaaga-blowholes,"These awe-inspiring blowholes are situated on a scenic coastline near the Taga village on the Samoan island of Savai’i. (You’ll sometimes hear them referred to as the Taga blowholes.) The Alofaaga blowholes and others like them developed thanks to lava flows that gradually carved out underwater caves. These sea caves grew upwards towards the land, until they became tunnels connecting the ocean to the rock face above. When water breaks against the seaward end of one of the Taga tunnels, it rushes into the tube, erupting through the hole above ground in a waterspout that may be as high as 20 meters, but is often much higher. The accompanying water pressure also causes a loud puffing sound, that punctuates each gush of seawater. Most of the land in Samoa is under customary ownership, in which land is owned by indigenous communities and administered under their jurisdiction. For this reason, the entrance to the blowholes is through the Taga village, and visitors pay a small fee to visit the natural wonder. First-time visitors may feel inclined to step back from the surging spray, but villagers have no such qualms. For another small fee, locals throw coconuts in the vent right before the big blow. The nuts rocket even higher than the water jet, easily reaching 100 feet. For the best show, come at high tide (and expect to get wet).  The Blowholes are open for viewing every day from 8 AM to 5 PM, except Sundays, when they are open from 12 PM to 5 PM."
34,Pulemelei Mound,Samoa,"An unmarked, overgrown path through dense vegetation leads to the largest ancient structure in Polynesia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pulemelei-mound,"Deep within the jungle on the Samoan island of Savai’i lies a big heap of stones half the size of a football field. This is the Pulemelei Mound — also known as the Tia Seu Ancient Mount — and nobody really knows when it was erected, or why it is there. With a base measuring 65 meters by 60 meters (213 feet by 197 feet), Pulemelei Mound consists of a foundational platform of volcanic rock supporting multiple layers of natural basalt stone, piled on top to a height of 12 meters (23 feet). The structure is pyramidal with flat top. Several purposes have been proposed for this structure, including use in religious ceremonies, as a lookout platform, or as a burial monument. It most likely served multiple functions, but in truth the reason for its construction and the role that it played remain unknown. Pulemelei Mount was most likely built sometime between 1100 and 1400 CE and remained active until 1700-1800, after which time it fell into disuse and was left to be reclaimed by the jungle. Although it is occasionally cleared of vegetation to reveal the details of its stone construction, the easily concealed structure is very quickly overgrown by the lush forest surrounding it once again, adding an additional degree of difficulty to the already tricky task of finding it. The site is located in Letolo Plantation, a short walk away from the road. The way is unmarked and can take some trial-and-error to find, and seeing a pyramid needs a bit of imagination if it has not been cleared up recently. Once there, however, you can see the ocean from the top, and the views are magnificent. It is a 40 minute walk from plantation via a forest footpath. Way to the mound is badly marked. Just before reaching to the place there is a sign on a tree showing way to a car park but there is no way of getting your car to that point."
35,Robert Louis Stevenson Museum,"Apia, Samoa",A museum now occupies the mansion in Samoa where the prolific Scottish writer chose to spend the last years of his life.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/robert-louis-stevenson-museum,"Born in Edinburgh, Robert Louis Stevenson was diagnosed with tuberculosis as a child which, along with his nomadic nature, led him on a series of travels in search of a warmer climate later in life. After several European and North American locales, the writer settled on life across the world—in Samoa. The house he and his family built there is now a museum packed with many of the writer’s original belongings. Stevenson—by this point a bona fide literary celebrity—and his family set sail from San Francisco in 1888 and toured the Pacific for three years, spending time in Hawaii, Tahiti, the Gilbert Islands, New Zealand, Sydney, and Samoa. It was in the latter that Stevenson finally settled, purchasing 127-hectares in 1890 for his recuperative residence. The house they built—named “Villa Vailima,” after the nearby village—ultimately  included five bedrooms, a library, a ballroom, and the only fireplace in Samoa, as well as a grand piano, a tablecloth from Queen Victoria, and a Rodin nude given as a gift by the artist himself. Despite this rather grand home, Stevenson made fast friends with many locals. For his efforts in advocating for indigenous political interests, he earned the familiar nickname “Tusitala” from the locals, meaning “Teller of Tales.” Stevenson, author of Treasure Island and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, died in 1894 at age 44 and, per his wishes, was buried atop the nearby Mount Vaea. After his wife, Fanny, passed away twenty years later, her ashes were brought from California and interred beside her husband’s remains. In the years after their deaths, their home housed first German, then New Zealand, and finally Samoan diplomats once independence was achieved. Severely damaged by hurricanes in 1990 and 1991, the mansion was fully renovated and reopened as the Robert Louis Stevenson Museum in December of 1994, a full century after the writer’s death. Today, Stevenson’s family home is the most popular tourist attraction on the island of Samoa, although it may only see a few outside visitors each day. The staff run a guided tour of the home, which is kept as it looked at the time of Stevenson’s death. On fair weather days, visitors can also take a hike to the top of the hill and pay their respects at the author’s burial site.  From the waterfront, flag a taxi down and head for the Cross Island Road. Directions can be found on the official website."

Called “the Mother Temple of the Pacific Islands,” it was the first Baha’i house of worship in the region. Plans for building a Baha’i house of worship in Western Samoa began in the mid-1970s. In January 1979, Malietoa Tanumafili II, one of four Samoan paramount chiefs, laid the first cornerstone, symbolically beginning construction. Malietoa, the first head of state to be a follower of the Baha’i faith, also dedicated the temple upon its completion in 1984. The temple was designed by Iranian-Canadian architect Hossein Amanat. As is required according to Baha’i scripture, the temple has a nine-sided circular shape. Like other Baha’i houses of worship around the world, the Samoan temple honors local cultural and environmental elements. The temple sits among 20 acres of prayer gardens comprised of over 60 species of plants, flowers, and tree, all native to Samoa. The dome of the temple itself is reminiscent of traditional Samoan architecture, the Samoan fale.  The temple is open daily from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. for prayer and meditation. Sunday service begins at 10 a.m. A free bus service leaves the Lelata Bahá’í Center in Apia at 9:15 a.m. and returns around 11:30 a.m."
37,The World Discoverer,Solomon Islands,The ship that got left behind.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-discoverer-g,"Both eerie and impressive to behold, this half-sunken oceanliner has been lying, tipped to one side, half-submerged since 2000. Once a globetrotting cruise ship, it was able to easily navigate the 8000 miles of the Northwest Passage, but a fateful date with an uncharted reef ended its seafaring career for good. While everyone aboard was safely evacuated, the ship began to list as it was brought into Roderick Bay, and the captain had no choice but to ground it, lest it sink entirely. The ship still rests there to this day and has become something of a tourist attraction. Several salvage companies have made attempts to retrieve the ship, but all found that it had already been ransacked by locals during the civil war the Solomon Islands endured. In addition, tidal activity has caused further damage to the structure and surface rusting. It is likely that this ship will remain in its place for a long time to come, until it slowly crumbles into the ocean.  The ship rests in Sandfly Passage, part of Roderick Bay."
38,Egg Fields of Savo Island,"Panueli, Solomon Islands",Megapodes incubate their eggs using the heat of an active volcano on this Pacific isle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/egg-fields-of-savo-island,"From Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, Savo Island is reached by a 30-minute boat ride across the Iron Bottom Sound—so named for the dozens of ships and planes that sank in it during World War II. The island is also home to an active, steaming volcano and bubbling hot springs. The heat attracts megapodes, chicken-sized black birds that utilize the warm environment to incubate their eggs. Accessing Savo’s volcano on foot takes about two hours, one way. The trek follows a path created by lava from the last eruption (which took place during the mid-19th century), surrounded by verdant jungle on either side. Hot springs and cold streams punctuate the path, but be careful: The water near the top is really, really hot. At dawn, megapodes lay and bury their eggs in the sandy fields around a village called Panueli. The volcanic earth keeps the eggs warm, so mother birds can simply fly off. Left unattended, the eggs become fair game for predators. Men from the village arrive, digging more than three feet down to unearth the birds’ nests. They work with their hands in order not to damage the large duck egg–sized treasures, then wrap the lot in banana leaves for safe keeping. Later in the day, women fill in the holes and level the sand. Villagers won’t kill megapodes for food, but they do collect eggs as a source of food and income. Each one is worth about $2. At one time, eggs were abundant in the sand fields around Panueli. But as of 2017, only one egg-laying field remains, and the yield is sparse. Over-harvesting has created an unsustainable environment for the megapodes, so all who visit should plan to bear witness to egg-laying at dawn, but to abstain from egg-snatching afterward.  While the villagers harvest the eggs for food and income, visitors should refrain from digging, trampling, or disrupting the megapodes' habitat."
39,Hunga Ha'apai New Volcano Island,Tonga,Underwater volcanic eruption forms new island off the coast of Tonga.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hunga-ha-apai-new-volcano-island,"Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai is an underwater volcano off the coast of Tonga, just 62km (39 mi) northwest of the Tongan capital of Nuku’alofa. The volcano gets its name from the two small islands it’s nestled between, Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha’apai, and is part of the highly active Tonga-Kermadec Islands volcanic arc. The area, which is known to Tongans as the islands that “jump back and forth” from seismic activity, is also part of the highly volcanic Pacific Ring of Fire. It is thus believed that Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai is part of a cluster of 36 undersea volcanoes. In March of 2009, Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai erupted for several days, sending a violent stream of steam, rocks, and ash thousands of feet into the air. For days, huge columns of smoke and ash were seen rising from the Pacific ocean. Geologists confirmed that the eruption came from two volcanic vents, one that was located on Hunga Ha’apai, and another located 100m (330 ft) offshore. The two vents ejected so much debris, however, that they created a new landmass between them. Though the eruption wiped out all signs of wildlife on the original islet, the “new” island added hundreds of square meters to Hunga Ha’apai."
40,Republic of Minerva,Tonga,"A failed utopia, shut down by a more legitimate nation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/republic-of-minerva,"Although many utopian societies seem doomed from the outset, the Republic of Minerva was up against a unique challenge: Creating a libertarian micronation on reclaimed reefs in the Pacific Ocean, when the land already had an owner. Situated 250 miles from Tonga, the Republic of Minerva was conceived by wealthy Nevada real estate mogul Michael Oliver. According to Oliver, his organization the Ocean Life Research Foundation had raised $100 million to create a utopian society on Pacific reefs. Oliver’s plan was to create a micro-nation without taxes, welfare or economic intervention, that lived chiefly off of tourism and fishing. In 1971, Minerva’s construction began by bringing barges of sand to the reefs to raise them out of the ocean. Oliver then led a conference of neighboring states in which he delcared his intentions, only to find out that Tonga had issued a claim over the land. At that point, Oliver and his organization jumped the gun a little bit. Ignoring other claims to Minerva, Oliver issued a declaration of independence and created a coin currency for his new nation and was all set to launch into his experiment in nation building. Unfortunately, the King of Tonga did not accept the new country’s legitimacy, and issued a document laying official claim to the reefs. Within months, representatives from Tonga made it clear they were in control of the reefs, and Oliver and his followers left without a fight. Since that time, a few other groups have tried to set up shop on the islands of Minerva, only to be rebuffed once again by the Tongan government. Almost all of the land brought to the reefs has since been reclaimed by the Pacific Ocean."
41,Ha‘amonga ‘a Maui,"Niutoua, Tonga","A massive trilithon nicknamed ""Stonehenge of the Pacific.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/haamonga-a-maui,"A strange trilithon—consisting of two standing stones with a lintel on top—on the island of Tongatapu, Ha‘amonga ‘a Maui stands about 17 feet tall and is 19 feet long. Each coral limestone slab weighs approximately 30 to 40 tons. Because of its clear resemblance, it has been nicknamed the “Stonehenge of the Pacific.” The name means “Maui’s Burden” in the local language, and as the stones are too heavy for humans to handle, it is believed that the god Maui himself brought them from ‘Uvea (Wallis Island) and constructed the monument. They now reside in a small roadside nature reserve. Archaeologists, on the other hand, generally seem to believe that the Ha‘amonga was built by an early 13th-century king as the gateway to his royal palace, Heketā. Otherwise, it has been suggested, it might have been used for astrological purposes. These theories are unconfirmed, however, and the origin of the huge trilithon remains a mystery."
