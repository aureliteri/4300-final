0,Österreichische Nationalbibliothek (Austrian National Library),"Vienna, Austria",The beautiful baroque library of the Hapsburg empire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/osterreichische-nationalbibliothek,"The Österreichische Nationalbibliothek (Austrian National Library) is a breathtaking baroque masterpiece, finished in 1726. Formerly the court library to the Hapsburgs, it is one of the world’s major libraries, with an extraordinary collection that dates back to the 14th century. The current collection contains around 2.5 million books. Visitors can visit many special collections in addition to the main halls, which include prints, maps, papyri, portraits, music, and theater. But the magnificent library itself is the focal point here. Among the exhibitions are two exquisite Venetian baroque globes — one for the Earth and one for the sky, each with a diameter of more than one meter. Keep your eye out for library employees slipping through concealed passages hidden behind certain bookcases."
1,Stephansdom Crypt,"Vienna, Austria",The crypt of the imposing Stephensdom holds royal intestines and thousands of skeletons.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stephansdom-crypt,"In the middle of Vienna, the dark and imposing St. Stephen’s Cathedral (Stephansdom) draws thousands of tourists to gaze at the grand architecture. But there is something to be seen below as well: just beneath the stone floors lie the skeletal remains of over 11,000 people. Surprisingly few visitors opt to enter the crypt. The entrance to the underground tomb is hidden in plain sight, as an innocuous staircase on the left side of the main floor. The vast Stephansdom crypt is divided into a number of smaller crypts and catacombs, and is still an active burial spot. The last tenant to move in was Franz Cardinal König, the archbishop of Vienna, who was laid to rest there in 2004. Most of the bodies of the Habsburg royalty are interred nearby in the Imperial Crypt on Neuer Markt square. In another section, known as the ducal crypt, the organs of princes, queens, and emperors are kept. Along with some bodies and hearts, over 60 jars of imperial intestines rest in the ducal crypt, including one containing Empress Maria Theresia’­s sovereign stomach. Not long ago, the seals on one jar broke, leaking 200-year-old visceral fluid onto the floor. The stink was apparently so awful that it took a day or two before someone was willing to go down and address the situation. In 1735, Vienna experienced an outbreak of the bubonic plague. In an effort to keep the Black Death at bay, the numerous cemeteries surrounding the Stephansdom and the charnel house (a building for storing stacked bones) were emptied, and thousands of bones and rotting corpses were thrown down into the pits dug in the floor of the crypt. The downside to this arrangement was that the smell of the catacombs would occasionally waft up into the church and make religious services impossible. To combat the unfortunate smell, as well as make room for more bodies, a few unlucky prisoners were lowered into the pits where they were forced to scrub the rotting flesh off the plague-ridden and disordered bodies, snapping and breaking the skeletons down to individual bones, and stacking them into neatly ordered rows, skulls on top. It seems that they never finished the job–to this day, one can still find sections of the crypt scattered with piles of disorganized bones and deteriorating coffins. Guided tours only. On special occasions like “die lange Nacht der Kirche” (“the long night of churches,” a yearly event), the crypt is open to the public. Inside the Cathedral, meet at the stairs to the catacombs, which are on the left side near the back as you enter the church."
2,Habsburg Imperial Crypt,"Vienna, Austria",The final resting place for the remains of 143 Habsburg royalty.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hapsburg-imperial-crypt-vienna,"Habsburg funerals were elaborate affairs. Death loomed large in the cultural life of the Viennese for centuries, celebrated in song, poetry, and artwork. Macabre memento-mori sculptures, designed to inspire piety, can be spotted throughout the city. The death of an emperor or empress was a major event. As one of the major imperial royal dynasties of Europe, as well as the Holy Roman Emperors from 1438 to 1740, the Habsburgs ruled over much of Europe until their downfall in World War I. For many Habsburg monarchs their death meant not only the creation of an elaborate and beautiful sarcophagus for the Imperial Crypt, but also a silver urn to preserve their heart and reliquaries to contain their embalmed entrails. After the funeral, the parts of the deceased would part ways, to be interred in three separate holy crypts. Twelve emperors, 18 empresses, and 113 other members of the Habsburg family are interred in the Imperial Crypt (Kaisergruft) in Vienna. The crypt, also known in German as the Kapuzinergruft (“Capuchins’ Crypt”), holds 105 metal sarcophagi, the most elaborate of them designed by the royal sculptor Balthasar Ferdinand Moll. The Rococo double sarcophagus of Emperor Franz Stephan and his wife Empress Maria Theresa is considered his masterpiece. The royal couple lie on top of the tomb, surrounded by elaborate reliefs illustrating scenes from their lives. The hearts of 54 members of the royal family are held in special urns in the Herzgruft, or “Heart Room,” located a few blocks away in St. George’s Chapel of the Augustinerkirche, and the embalmed entrails of princes, queens and emperors are kept in the Ducal Crypt below the St. Stephen’s Cathedral (Stephansdom). The Imperial Crypt below the Capuchin Church and monastery was originally intended to hold only the remains of Empress Anna and Emperor Matthias, who died in 1618 and 1619. The crypt was expanded many times over the centuries to accommodate more royal remains: first in 1657 by Emperor Leopold I, again in 1754 by his daughter the Empress Maria Theresa, then again in 1908 by Emperor Franz Joseph. The buildings were restored more recently in the 1960s. Emperor Franz Joseph’s sarcophagus is the only one made from stone instead of metal. It is flanked by the coffins of his wife Elisabeth and son Rudolf. It was Rudolf’s mysterious and tragic suicide (after murdering his 17-year-old mistress) in 1889 that began the downward trajectory of the Habsburg Empire. Because Rudolf left no male heir, the crown was passed from Franz Joseph to his nephew, Franz Ferdinand, whose assassination in 1914 tipped off World War I. Charles I, Franz Ferdinand’s heir, became the last emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Neither Franz Ferdinand nor Charles, however, is interred in the Imperial Crypt. Franz Ferdinand is interred with his wife Sophie in Artstetten Castle, Austria. Charles is interred with his wife Zita in the Church of Our Lady of Monte, in Madeira, and their hearts are held at the Loreto Chapel of Muri Abbey in Italy. Archduke Otto, the last Crown Prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was interred in the Imperial Crypt following his death on July 4th, 2011. He is the last Habsburg to be interred there.  Located below the Capuchin Church on Neuer Markt square."
3,Schmetterlinghaus: The Imperial Butterfly Park,"Vienna, Austria",A tropical paradise just a short trip from the opera house is filled with beautiful winged creatures.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/schmetterlinghaus-imperial-butterfly-park,"Built around the turn of the last century and part of the Hofburg palace, this “Jugendstil” or Art Nouveau greenhouse is filled with a lush, tropical landscape, trickling waterfalls, and within its humid walls you will be treated to its delicate inhabitants - the butterflies. Peeking into hollow trees and up among the branches, you can watch the graceful favorites of the bug world flitter and fly, or softly rest and pulse their exotic wings, possibly on your outstretched finger. A closer look could very well uncover cocoons, or you may even catch a hatching. The butterfly house offers two levels from which to seek sights of the colorful flyers. A short film at the end of your walk though the butterfly habitat will give you some scientific insight on the ethereal creatures you just enjoyed inside the tropical forest in the center of a city.  As of June 2021, the butterfly house requires a negative COVID-19 test or immunization card to enter.  It is located next door to the Palmhaus."
4,Clock Museum,"Vienna, Austria","A small museum filled with over 1,000 clocks, and one particular clock calibrated to run until the year 9999.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/clock-museum,"The Viennese Clock Museum is housed in the Harfenhaus (Harpist’s House), one of the oldest homes in Vienna. With around 1,000 clocks in the “Uhrenmuseum,” there is much to see. Of particular note is the 230-year-old astronomical clock, constructed by an Augustinian friar. Built in 1679, and calibrated up to the year 9999, it is a gorgeous piece of engineering. With layers upon layers of golden gears, and over 30 readings and dials, it is stunning. Each hand takes 20,000 years to revolve. It’s all arranged in chronological order, from ornate pocket watches, to a 15th-century tower clock, to sundials, to rare Japanese pillar clocks, to grandfather clocks, to Black Forest cuckoo clocks, to a huge clock organ (unfortunately not working at the time of this writing). Update October 2017: The astronomical clock is not on display."
5,Kriminalmuseum,"Vienna, Austria",Macabre museum devoted to historical Viennese murders.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kriminalmuseum,"Skulls, medieval torture devices, bloody gloves, depictions of murder, death masks, and rusty axes - the Kriminalmuseum in Vienna, Austria is not for the faint of heart. The Kriminalmuseum or Criminal museum follows crime, punishment and murder from the Middle Ages right up to the present day. It is housed in one of the oldest buildings in the Leopoldstadt area, the “Seifensiederhaus,” or “Soap Boilers House,” and dates back to 1685. Twenty rooms of this 324 year old home are devoted to this surprisingly large and very morbid museum about crime and murder. Of course the Kriminalmuseum is about more than just murder. There are cases devoted to counterfeit money, lock picking, brothels, and police investigation. But mostly, images of crime scenes, murder weapons and the skulls of both murderers and their victims fill the space. While macabre, the museum has a fascinating and somewhat mysterious quality to it. For non-German speakers there is a further air of mystery: the informational signs and grisly newspaper articles are all in German. Though sometimes, in the Kriminalmuseum, it is better not to know."
6,Karlskirche (St. Charles's Church),"Vienna, Austria","Built to give thanks for the passing of a plague epidemic, this cathedral is a one-of-a-kind architectural hybrid.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/karlskirche-st-charles-church,"The Karlskirche cathedral is a unique architectural curiosity, a mix of ancient Greek and Roman elements with Byzantine, Renaissance, and Baroque styles. Commissioned by the Habsburg Imperial Court to fulfill a religious vow, its symbolic details also sought to bolster Vienna’s historic claim as the temporal center of Christendom. In the early 18th century, Central Europe was hit by the last great outbreak of the Black Plague. Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI made a vow to build a church dedicated to St. Carlo Borromeo—revered for attending to Milanese plague victims in the 16th century, and the emperor’s namesake—if the city was saved. After the plague passed, the new church was officially announced in 1713. The church was designed by court architect Johann Bernard Fischer von Erlach, whose Baroque architecture profoundly influenced and shaped the tastes of the Habsburg Empire. Von Erlach’s ambitious design is centered around a portico in the Ancient Greek temple style, flanked by two columns modeled after Trajan’s Column in Rome. The twin columns reference Solomon’s Temple as well as the Pillars of Hercules (a symbol adopted by Charles V to represent the Holy Roman Empire), and are together reminiscent of the Pantheon of antiquity. The columns feature reliefs crafted by the Italian sculptor Lorenzo Mattielli, and depict scenes from the life St. Borromeo. The dome recalls that of St. Peter’s Basilica, but is remarkably different in that the base is an elongated ellipsoid. At the main altar, a scene portrays the ascension of St. Borromeo. Above the sculpture group, a circle of angels and sun rays is arrayed in front of a source of light, echoing a similar design found in St. Peter’s Basilica. The fresco of the dome was painted by Johann Michael Rottmayr of Salzburg and Gaetano Fanti of Bologna, and displays an intercession of St. Borromeo—supported by the Virgin Mary—pleading to the Holy Trinity to end the plague in Vienna."
7,The Narrenturm,"Vienna, Austria",This former insane asylum now holds a pathological anatomy museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/narrenturm,"Meaning “Fools’ Tower,” the Narrenturm was one of the first insane asylums ever built. Today the Narrenturm no longer holds mentally imbalanced Viennese, but it does contain something else of interest: The Anatomical-Pathological Museum. While the circular building (known by locals as “the poundcake”) houses only a small percent of the museum’s total collection, it contains some fascinating pieces. Syphilitic skulls that resemble Swiss cheese, jars of disfigured fetuses, and graphic wax displays of untreated STDs all peer out at you from the old cells. It also contains a recreated wonder cabinet, complete with a narwhal tusk and taxidermied monkeys. Keep your eyes open for the Hydrocephalic skeleton, towards the end of the museum. His enormous head is hard to miss. Update August 2017: The building is undergoing a major renovation and much of the collection has been moved into storage. Update 2021: The Narrenturm is open to visitors.  As of 2021, the Narrenturm is open to visitors every Wednesday from 10:00 am to 6:oo pm"
8,The Lost Garden of Schloss Schonbrunn,"Vienna, Austria",The topiary maze at the Habsburg hunting lodge.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lost-garden-schloss-schonbrunn,"Schloss Schonbrunn, in Vienna, is the ridiculously resplendent former hunting lodge and summer palace of the Habsburgs. The palace is, of course, massive and ornate. But one of the most delightful features is surely the Irrgarten, or “lost garden,” otherwise known as a topiary maze. The original maze was demolished in 1892, for courtiers, royalty and various ladies of the court were meeting in the center of the maze and “disreputable encounters” were taking place. It was rebuilt in 1999 following the design of the original maze from 1686, and is surprisingly challenging to navigate."
9,Republic of Kugelmugel,"Vienna, Austria","A spherical ""micro-nation"" in the heart of Vienna.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/republic-kugelmugel,"The Republic of Kugelmugel (roughly, “spherical hill”) was originally constructed by the artist Edwin Lipburger and his son Nikolaus Lipburger in 1971, in a small Austrian town called Katzelsdorf. The building has 7.68 m in diameter and is constructed of timber blocks covered with zinc sheets. At first, it served as a painter’s atelier. But after some time local authorities informed the Lipburgers that spherical buildings were not allowed. In an attempt to protect their creation from being demolished, the Lipburgers created their own Kugelmugel township, complete with self-made street signs surrounding the sphere. Later, as the legal dispute escalated, Edwin Lipburger attempted to declare the structure as its own federal state, the Republic of Kugelmugel, even going so far as to issue his own stamps and currency and refusing to pay taxes. The elder Lipburger was eventually sent to jail, for 10 weeks in 1979, for the offense of putting up unapproved street signs. The key to understanding Kugelmugel is that it was founded as a “republic” both as an artistic intervention and in order to protect the spherical house from being demolished. As an act of resistance, it earned quite a few fans. In the early 1980s, Austria’s culture minister, Helmuth Zilk, suggested Kugelmugel be moved to the Vienna Prater amusement park. The Lipburgers went along with the idea, having been promised access to tap water, electricity, and sewers. But these facilities were never provided, which resulted in a long-lasting dispute with the city of Vienna. Edwin Lipburger died in 2015, but Kugelmugel still sits in Vienna Prater, enclosed in barbed wire. A proud “micronation,” it counts about 600 people as citizens, though their citizenship is enjoyed from afar.  Kugelmugel is located in Vienna's famous Prater park. Today it is mostly a gallery space that's open to the public for exhibitions and performances several times a year."
10,Palmenhaus,"Vienna, Austria",Dine amidst exotic plants at this former royal greenhouse.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palmenhaus-austrian-greenhouse-restaurant,"In Vienna, plants and humans can sit side by side and enjoy the sunlight, high ceilings, and dazzling views of the royal gardens. Formerly a greenhouse built for Austrian emperors, Palmenhaus now serves as a cafe, bar, and lounge where folks can dine amidst exotic flora. The first iteration of the greenhouse was built in 1822, overlooking the expansive Hofburg palace gardens. Nearly 80 years later, Austrian architect Friedrich Ohmann built the extravagant, steel-and-glass Jugendstil structure that still stands today. After a multimillion dollar renovation in 1998, the building now boasts more than 22,000 square feet of magnificent flora, food, and even a bunch of butterflies. (You’ll find them in the Schmetterlingshaus, or “House of Butterflies.”) Want to dine al fresco? You can venture out onto the Burggarten, a vast patio overlooking the former emperor’s gardens. You’ll find all sorts of delicious items to munch on, from freshly-baked pastries to fish dishes to decadent desserts. Though the lunch and dinner menus change daily, you can always expect to find the classic Viennese morning meal of handmade rolls, jam, and blossom honey on the breakfast menu. But, no matter what you order, the best part of your meal will likely be feasting your eyes on the greenery and glass fit for an emperor, or at least his plants.  If you're planning on visiting Palmenhaus for lunch or dinner, consider making a reservation via phone or online. (Note: They do not take reservations for the Burggarten.) If you're dining on a Friday evening, be sure to head over to the lounge for live DJ sets, where you can dance among the plants."
11,Globe Museum,"Vienna, Austria",Handsomely crafted representations of our round planet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/globe-museum,"Until the 19th century, globes often came as a pair—a world globe and a matching celestial globe. One can’t help but observe the admirable craft and beauty that was once devoted to these small representations of our world. To visit the Globe Museum is to step back into a time when all things, including scientific instruments, were made with care and artistry. There is no better way to explore the ways in which man’s understanding of the earth and the heavens has changed over hundreds of years of exploration and study. The world’s only public museum dedicated solely to globes contains an astonishing collection. (The Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, also has an extensive globe collection.) There are folding fabric globes (which were inflated with a bellows), giant man-sized globes, and tiny plum-sized globes, each exquisitely made with dark wood, fine lines, and rich colors. Some of the most interesting items in the museum are the brass tellurions. A tellurion is a mechanical demonstration of the earth’s movement about its axes, consisting of a long arm at the end of which is a small rotating globe with a moon spinning around it. At the other end of the arm is a charmingly simple sun: a candle and a brass reflecting disc. With a turn of the crank, the system comes alive. As the earth and moon spin, the tellurion shows seasons, eclipses, tides, precessions of the equinox, and other astronomical phenomena."
12,Sigmund Freud Museum,"Vienna, Austria",The former private quarters and office of Dr. Sigmund Freud now hosts a museum housing the works of the founding father of psychoanalysis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sigmund-freud-museum,"For 47 years, the controversial neurologist and pioneer of psychoanalysis lived and worked in the house at Berggasse 19. While his famous couch resides in the Freud Museum in London, along with many of the original furnishings from the Berggasse house, what remains is the precious legacy the good doctor left behind. Most of his writings were conjured here, and the rooms have been converted into archives of his life and works. Along with the lion’s share of Freud’s papers, the museum houses his impressive antique collection, and many of his personal items are located in what used to be his waiting room. Exhibitions display his influence on art and society, and attached to the museum are 35,000 volumes of psychoanalytic research, the largest library of its kind in Europe. Opened in 1971 by the Sigmund Freud Society with his youngest daughter Anna present, the museum now lies in the hands of the Sigmund Freud Foundation. The foundation hosts the Sigmund Freud Lecture every year on May 6th, the doctor’s birthday. While it is not the most colorful museum dedicated to the man, students and scholars will find it to be a suitable place to examine original documents and experience the few film and sound recordings made of Freud and his family."
13,Museum of Art Fakes,"Vienna, Austria",This Austrian museum celebrates the work of famous forgers and their inimitable imitations.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-art-fakes,"Sitting across from the famous work of architectural art, Hundertwasserhaus, one of the most original works in the world, is a small museum that takes a look at the other side of the art world where forgers, fakers, and charlatans thrive. The Museum of Art Fakes (Fälschermuseum) in Vienna is a little gallery that doesn’t have an original work in it. The collection contains works that appear to be from such art world luminaries as Klimt, Rembrandt, and Matisse, but were in fact created by the hand of some enterprising forger. Rather than condemning the practice, the museum celebrates the artistry of the forgery, being careful to distinguish different types of fakery. As their website describes it, there is forgery in the style of another painter, where a forger tries to create something they can pass off as a new work from a famous name; there is the identical forgery that is created to exactly replicate a pre-existing work; and there are copies, which are identical works created at least 70 years after the death of the original painter and sold as replicas. The collection also highlights a few notable forgers including Tom Keating who claims to have forged over 2,000 works as a statement against the corruption of the gallery scene, planting “time-bombs” in his replicas that could be discovered later, invalidating the forgeries to any duped collector. Of course, even these forgeries are now valuable. The museum also displays a number of forged diary pages purported to have been written by Adolf Hitler. Faking something well is no easy feat. Thanks to the Museum of Art Fakes, the appreciation of charlatan art is very real."
14,Crystal Worlds,"Wattens, Austria",Swarovski's museum/theme park is a fake diamond fantasia overlooked by a giant.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crystal-worlds,"Hiding in the verdant hills of Wattens, Austria is a foliage-covered giant who spews a waterfall from his mouth and guards over a dozen fantastical crystal chambers beneath a hill. And it is all owned by Swarovski. Swarovski’s surreal museum/theme park Crystal Worlds was first opened back in 1995 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the company’s founding. Like something out of a fairy tale, the park’s main attraction is the “Chambers of Wonder” exhibition, which is contained within a green hill, the entrance of which is made to look like a crouching giant. The exhibition itself consists of over a dozen different rooms decked out in Swarovski crystals, creating uniquely themed, glittering spaces that could just as easily be a dwarf king’s treasure hall. In 2015, the park was given a facelift and expanded to almost double the original size. Now it also features a large, outdoor green space with attractions throughout, including a playground tower for children and a “Crystal Cloud” made up of over 800,000 separate gems. There is even a hedge maze shaped like a giant hand. Whether or not you could actually afford anything studded with actual Swarovski crystals, Crystal Worlds is an incredible sight for anyone with a love of fantasy."
15,Hundertwasser's Odd Architecture,"Vienna, Austria",Op-art architecture designed for happiness.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/europe-s-oddest-architect,"Born Friedrich Stowasser in Vienna in 1928, this artist and architect took on the more grandiose name Friedensreich Regentag Dunkelbunt Hundertwasser during a stint at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Preferring spirals and curves to straight lines, he designed many eccentric structures with mismatched windows, some with trees growing out of them, undulating floors, bright tiles, and unexpected domes and curves. Three of his most famous structures can be seen in Vienna; the municipal heating plant Fernwarmewerk, the Hundertwasserhaus apartment building, and the KunstHaus, which is a museum of his works. Hundertwasser grew up in WWII-era Germany. Born to Catholic and Jewish parents, he joined the Hitler Youth to avoid persecution. His unusual architecture is an extension of his overall philosophy, outlined in the 1950s in assorted manifestos with names like “Mouldiness Manifesto against Rationalism in Architecture”, and “Speech in Nude for the Right to a Third Skin”, which must have been most interesting when presented live. He believed that happiness could be found in joyful design, and that the straight lines and boxes of traditional architecture were a problem to be solved. Hundertwasser’s eccentric structures delight visitors in Austria, Germany, Japan and and New Zealand. His final design was built after his death in Magdeburg, Germany in 2005. The artist lived in New Zealand in his later years, and died in 2000 aboard the RMS Queen Mary 2 en route to Germany where he was to view his last work, the “Waldspirale” in Darmstadt. In Vienna: Hundertwasserhaus (private residence) Hundertwasser’s most famous building was constructed between 1983 and 1986. The flowing lines and organic forms house 52 apartments and four offices, with plenty of room for living plants and trees. He accepted no payment for the massive building design, stating that it was worth it to him to see his design realized instead of having “something ugly” erected in its place. Kegelgasse 36-38, between Lowengasse and Untere Weissgerberstrasse. Fernwarmewerk Spittelau (heating plant) Famed for its golden sphere and colorful smokestack, the district heating plant may be his most striking work of op-art. Spittelauer Lande 45 Hundertwasser facade Hunderwasser only desiged the front of this mosaic covered building.

16,Brest Hero-Fortress,"Brest, Belarus",Thanks to its heroic service during WWII this Soviet castle has been turned into a monument towered over by a brutalist titan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brest-hero-fortress,"Much like the Soviet “Hero Cities” that were given a special title due to their special defense of the nation during World War II, the Brest Fortress (now “Hero-Fortress”) acted as a critical bulwark during the German invasion and now the site is protected as a major war memorial distinguished by its brutalist concrete statues and architecture. First established in 1830 the fortress was designed as an impenetrable star sitting at the confluence of two rivers. There was a central structure known as the “Citadel” which was protected on all sides by three wide fortifications. As the westernmost defensive position in the Soviet empire in the 19th and early 20th century, Brest Fortress was a proud symbol of national strength almost from its inception, but it was also an important target for European invaders. After changing hands a few times during and after World War I, the Brest Fortress earned its lasting legacy during the World War II German invasion, Operation Barbarossa. During the siege, tens of thousands of German troops hammered the fortress which held strong thanks to a garrison of civilians and military who were nearly able to turn back the assault. Eventually the fortress fell however, with much of it being destroyed or damaged during the siege. At the end of the war Brest was liberated and the fortress was retaken from the Germans, still the worse for wear. Instead of demolishing the complex, the entire site was turned into a huge memorial to the fighting men and women who died defending the position. It was given the new title of “Hero Fortress” and eventually large pieces of statuary were installed. Today much of the defense is preserved just as it was after the war with the crumbling walls and bullet holes intact. Among the stunning and powerful sights are the massive star-shaped gate, a memorial known as “Thirst” that shows a sickly soldier getting a drink of river water, and the main monument which takes the form of an imperious stone giant. The main museum also holds a wealth of displays telling the story of the fortress. The main entrance is in the end of praspekt Mašerava. You can enter or leave the complex from other gates as well. Part of the complex is a border zone between Belarus and Poland."
17,Minsk KFC,"Minsk, Belarus",Remnants of the city's Soviet history hover over this modern fast-food outlet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/minsk-kfc,"It’s difficult to miss the irony when you spot the smiling face of Colonel Sanders beckoning you in for fried chicken beneath a dramatic Soviet mural. At one of Minsk’s ever-expanding KFC franchises, communism and capitalism collide in a confusing contrast of heroic sculptures and crispy fried chicken. This is the most dramatic of Minsk’s KFC outlets, just one of many fast-food chains that crept into the Belarusian market as the country began to emerge from isolation in the last few years. KFC first set up business in Belarus in 2015, while the Soviet sculpture that sits above the fried chicken shop was carved in the 1960s. The sculpture, designed in the style of Socialist Realism that was popular across the Soviet Union at the time, is named “Solidarity” and was created by the sculptor Anatol Yafimovich Arcimovich. The KFC was designed in the style of countless other KFCs that you’ll find across the world, from the United States to China, with the distinctive red colors of the Colonel’s enduring brand filling in for the red of socialism. Perhaps this is how the Cold War was always meant to end, as the workers of the world unite to dine on bargain buckets of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The reality is less idealistic, but this Soviet-style KFC in Minsk is still definitely a measure of change in the Belarusian capital. Minsk suffered immeasurable damage during the fierce fighting of World War II, but once the German army had been beaten back, Minsk was honored as a Hero City and was rebuilt and restyled into a Soviet model city, on the express orders of Joseph Stalin. The wide boulevards and elaborate murals and sculptures are a lasting relic of the Socialist era, while the fast-food chains and Western brands mark the turning point toward capitalism. Whether you’re a fan of the Colonel’s fried chicken or not, there’s no doubt that this is one of the most striking KFCs in the world. In fact, it’s probably the most Soviet KFC in the world.  This KFC is found on the corner of Prospekte Pobeditelei, opposite Niamiha Metro Station and just down the road from the Palace of Sports."
18,Museum of Malformations of the Human Body,"Hrodna, Belarus","This rare collection of human deformities displays fetuses with two faces, one eye, and ""mermaid"" legs.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-malformations-of-the-human-body,"Tucked away at in the basement of the Grodno Medical State University in Belarus is a small museum that isn’t for the faint-hearted. Lined up against the walls are rows of glass containers holding preserved fetuses and babies with serious deformities: Siamese twins who remained connected after birth, “mermaids” with their legs fused together, fetuses with only one eye, babies with two faces. These malformed fetuses were collected during the 19th and 20th century, and initially remained in storage until 2000 when an exhibit was created and opened to the public for a brief period. It reopened in its current format in 2012 and is a fascinating spot for those interested in teratology, or the study of abnormal formations and anatomical abnormalities. One of the missions of the museum is to emphasize the importance of healthy lifestyles. To this end, the museum is divided into two halls. One of the halls contains exhibits relating to common lifestyle problems like smoking, alcoholism, and obesity. The other hall houses the collection of babies with abnormalities that researchers believe were a result of the parent’s lifestyle choices. A similar collection would be hard to gather today thanks to modern medical advances that have made it easy to diagnose such problems in the early stages of a pregnancy. The building itself has early medical connections. It was built by King Stefan Bathory, of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, who died in the palace under mysterious circumstances in 1586. His doctors performed an autopsy on his body to get some answers, and this was the first anatomical autopsy in eastern Europe.  The museum is open from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday. The admission fee is 1 ruble ($0.53) and goes directly to the funding of the Medical University. Guided tours can be arranged if agreed upon in advance."
19,Museum of Confiscated Art,"Brest, Belarus",A small museum in this border city displays the contraband art that has been stolen back from smugglers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-confiscated-art,"Sitting on the border of the tumultuous Soviet Union, the city of Brest, Belarus became a prime destination for art thieves looking to secrete their goods across international lines, but thanks to a committed customs service, much of these artifacts are taken back by the authorities before they can ever be fenced. When the owners of these confiscated artifacts cannot be found, rather than hiding them away or destroying them, the items are put on display in the city’s small but wildly diverse Museum of Rescued Art Treasures. The collection contains over 300 pieces that have been collected, mainly during the 1990s when smugglers were trying to take advantage of the political upheaval in Russia. Items on display range from ancient artifacts from the 16th century to contemporary works of art. Historic bibles, religious triptychs, Soviet sculptures, paintings, and all manner of other works are on exhibit within the confines of the home-sized museum. The largest find on display is an entire set of antique furniture that was found hidden in a shipment of milk powder. Unfortunately, not all of the “saved” pieces came out of their ordeals unscathed. In order to transport some of the larger items they had to be chopped up into component parts, and have been reassembled as well as possible in the museum, although they will clearly never be the same. Nonetheless, it is a far nobler fate than being sold on the black market and forever lost to the world."
20,Cat Museum,"Minsk, Belarus","This Minsk museum has cat coffee, cat chess, cat art, and even a cat ""staff,"" which visitors are free to take home.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cat-museum,"At this museum in Minsk, visitors can enjoy anything and everything cat related. Why not drink a cup of cat coffee or cat tea while playing cat chess or cat checkers, admiring cat art? Or, if you prefer, pet one of the cats that comprise the museum’s “staff.” The Cat Museum opened to the public in 2015. Jimmy the cat, the furry, four-legged “director” of the museum, welcomed everyone to the first exhibition. Titled Cats in the City, it showed photos, paintings, and other pieces of arts made by both Belarusian and foreign artists. Ever since, there have been cat-related exhibitions on display in the museum and visitors are also welcome to leave their own pieces of arts using the pens and papers provided. The staff of the museum consists of cats that were previously strays. After veterinary inspection and vaccination, they become full-time employees at the Cat Museum. Of course, the director also has a few human employees to help out. And, unlike most museums, a visitor who finds a staff member they like in particular is welcome to bring him or her home if they promise to take good care of them. The Cat Museum is only a short walk from the metro station Oktyabrskaya (Kastryčnickaja). It is open 11-21 Tuesday-Saturday, 11-4 Sunday, and closed Monday."
21,National Library of Belarus,"Minsk, Belarus","Glowing orb in Minsk houses 8,600,000 items.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-library-of-belarus,"In 2006 when the new National Library of Belarus was constructed, nobody had ever heard of a rhombicuboctahedron. With 8 triangular faces and 18 square faces, the bizarre geometric shape was chosen for the new design of the library and has been turning heads since its construction. Designed by architects Mihail Vinogradov and Viktor Kramarenko, the library’s main section is 236 feet high and features 22 levels of collections along with large conference rooms that can seat 500 people. In total, the library has 8,600,000 items available in a variety of languages and types of media. Although its size and shape are unique, when the building is illuminated it steps into a class of its own. Dominating the landscape for miles around, the glowing orb has almost become more of a tourist attraction than a functional library. This is probably aided by the newly designed park which houses the library, along with the library’s observation deck that looks over Minsk."
22,Kafe Gagarin,"Brest, Belarus",Take Soviet nostalgia to new heights by toasting the first man in space over a full spread of Belarusian and Soviet fare.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kafe-gagarin,"On April 12, 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first astronaut to orbit the Earth. Named a Hero of the Soviet Union, he remains one of the most famous cosmonauts in the history of space travel. Decades later, long after the fall of the Soviet Union and Gagarin’s own death in a training-jet crash, his legacy as the first man in space is still revered, especially at Kafe Gagarin, a Soviet-themed restaurant in Brest, Belarus, that celebrates all things Gagarin while serving Kremlin-worthy dishes that might even have satisfied Stalin. It’s a unique, yet endearingly bizarre place to dine. The outside seating—a series of booths set inside a stretched, 1960s-style sedan and decorated with a backdrop of a Soviet beach holiday—doesn’t exactly fit chilly, inland Belarus. Inside, you’re greeted by a beaming Yuri Gagarin, depicted in a mural in full cosmonaut gear. Newspaper cuttings from April 12, 1961, adorn the front walls and serve as placemats, while the television’s endless loop of black and white newsreels take you back to the lofty heights of the Soviet space program. Communist flags hang from the ceiling, and Soviet stars decorate the napkins and menus. But Kafe Gagarin is more than just a nostalgic shrine to Yuri Gagarin, and compared to the cosmonauts’ early space food, the Belarusian and Soviet classics on the menu are out of this world. While Gagarin is blasted into space, you can slurp an appetizer of vibrantly pink borscht soup. When Gagarin lands back on earth, you’ll be tucking into plates of vareniki dumplings and stacks of draniki, the Belarusian potato pancake staple. And thanks to a plentiful selection of beers, wines, and vodkas, you can wash down pork cutlets or chicken kievs as you’re transported to a bygone era."
23,Mound of Glory,"Smaliavicki rajon, Belarus",A striking Soviet memorial commemorates the liberation of Belarus from the Nazis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mound-of-glory,"Anyone heading toward or out of Minsk on the Minsk-Moscow highway can hardly miss the dramatic bayonet-shaped obelisks towering over the road, a little outside the city. The unusual-looking Mound of Glory memorial honors the soldiers that fought and died in the Second World War, and is a tribute to an important victory in Soviet history, Operation Bagration, which liberated the region from the Nazis in 1944. The memorial complex was built in 1969 to mark the 25th anniversary of Belarus’ liberation from the German forces. The operation was carried out by four fronts of the Soviet Army, and their heroism is celebrated through the four tall bayonets, surrounded by a huge ring. The inside of the ring is decorated by mosaic tributes. The more striking outer side depicts the faces of soldiers and military symbols. The 230-feet mound it’s built on has its own significance—it was formed using scorched soil from “hero cities,” a Soviet honorary title for places that showed great courage during the period of German occupation. Visitors can walk up to the top of the structure to take a closer look at the ring and the bayonets. The memorial is a solemn structure, a reminder of a war where thousands of lives were lost, but its height and scenic overlook have made it a popular spot for newlyweds to snap pictures."
24,The Stalin Line,"Minski rajon, Belarus","Remains of the old fortification along the Western border of the USSR, now an elaborate defense museum.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-stalin-line-minski-rajon-belarus,"Not far from the capital city of Belarus is one of the most grandiose defense museums in Eastern Europe, the Stalin Line Historical and Cultural Complex, named after the original Stalin Line, a network of fortifications along the Western border of the former Soviet Union. The fortified line was built in the 1920s to protect against attacks from the West. But when an attack from the West did come two decades later, the line provided little defense. The Stalin Line was an impressive line of concrete bunkers and weapons emplacements, aka pillboxes, that stretched from the Karelian Isthmus near Finland to the shores of the Black Sea. However, it was abandoned by 1940 in favor of a newer line being built further West at the frontier of the expanding USSR. When Germany invaded in 1941, the new line was not yet finished, and the old line was in disrepair, leaving the Soviet Union vulnerable. Today, what remains of this historical system can be found in various places across Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. To commemorate the 60 year anniversary of Great Patriotic War (World War II), a collection of military paraphernalia was amassed in the area of the line near Minsk. The museum complex includes a collection of trenches, roadblocks, bunkers, dots and other fortifications, and all kinds of technology like radar systems, boats, helicopters, war planes, tanks and weapons. Visitors who are keen on racing around in a war machine can even try out some of this equipment. But one exhibit stands as a reminder of the horrors of warfare: Called “Bombed House,” it is a replica of what an ordinary house would look like after being bombed in war."
25,Geographic Center of Europe,"Polotsk, Belarus",A monument in the Belarusian city of Polotsk claims to mark the exact midpoint of the European continent.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/geographic-center-of-europe,"The small city of Polotsk in the Vitebsk region of northern Belarus is the exact geographic center of the European continent. Or so it claims. Admittedly, the geographic center of Europe is more widely recognized as being slightly further to the east outside Vilnius, Lithuania, based on research led by Jean-George Affholder of the National Geographic Institute of France. However, more recent research conducted by a Belarusian team (who presumably had no bias whatsoever) identified the center of Europe as being in their own country. Belarusian geodesists Alexey Solomonov and Valery Anoshko published their discovery in 2000 in a Moscow-based technical magazine. This most recent in a long line of claimants to the “center of Europe” title was verified by Russian scientists from the Central Research Institute of Geodesy, Aerial Survey and Cartography in Moscow. The prized location in Polotsk is memorialized by a monument established in 2008. Though small in comparison to some of the larger Soviet-era monuments nearby—including a lovely Lenin statue up the street—the center of Europe marker is a very nicely designed element of the tree-lined city center, even if the claim is taken with a pinch of salt by locals. The monument depicts the northern hemisphere of the Earth with a map of Europe crossed by meridians. The boat on top of the marker is a symbol of the city of Polotsk, which was an important trading post on the River Dvina dating back to the time of the Vikings. In addition to visiting the monument, if you head to the nearby post office, you can purchase a certificate to prove you’ve been to the very heart of the continent.  The marker is in a public park in the center of town, surrounded by many shops, restaurants, and museums to explore. Inscriptions on the monument are written in Swedish, Russian, Greek, English, and Belarusian."
26,Lee Harvey Oswald's Apartment in Minsk,"Minsk, Belarus",The apartment building where JFK's assassin lived after defecting to the Soviet Union.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lee-harvey-oswalds-apartment-in-minsk,"The assassination of John F. Kennedy might never have occurred if it wasn’t for the dull nightlife of Minsk in the 1960s. Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin accused of shooting President John F. Kennedy, defected to the USSR in the early ’60s, after he was discharged from the U.S. Marine Corps. His hope was to attend the Moscow State University, but instead the Soviet authorities sent him to work as a lathe operator in Minsk. Apart from his job at Gorizont Electronics, which produced radios, televisions and electronics for space and military use, he was given Russian lessons and a government-subsidized studio apartment in downtown Minsk, more luxurious than any working class Russian could dream of. He even met a pharmacology student Marina Prusakova there, and married her in 1961. The apartment and cushy lifestyle did come with a price. As a U.S. citizen, Oswald and his wife were under constant surveillance from the neighboring apartment. A KGB agent on duty could hear the married couple’s conversation through the thin walls and there was even a peephole with a magnifying lens into their bedroom. Oswald’s life in the USSR did not pan out the way he expected. In his diary he wrote, “I am starting to reconsider my desire about staying. The work is drab, the money I get has nowhere to be spent. No nightclubs or bowling alleys, no places of recreation except the trade union dances. I have had enough.” Shortly afterwards, he wrote to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow requesting his American passport back, since he never formally renounced his U.S. citizenship. The following year, Oswald returned to the U.S., along with his wife and their infant daughter. He made history a few years later, when he was accused of killing President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. Who knows, if Minsk had had in the ’60s a fraction of the night clubs, bars, bowling establishments, cinemas and restaurants it has today, history might have taken a completely different turn. The apartment is a private residence and is not open to the public, but it is possible to see the building from the outside. There are no signs indicating which unit it is. Some sources suggest the apartment was at the top right of the building while others say the bottom left. There is, however, a hostel in the same building at the top left facing the square."
27,Isle of Tears,"Minsk, Belarus",A beautiful and moving memorial set on a little island in the middle of the river in Minsk.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/isle-of-tears,"This aesthetically beautiful and moving monument in Minsk commemorates the Soviet soldiers from Belarus who died in the long war with Afghanistan in the 1970s. At the base are several huge statues depicting weeping or stoical women, who express the pain and sadness of the mothers, sisters, and wives of their generation. It’s a very striking memorial, which benefits from its picturesque location on a small island in the river Svislach.  The island is reached by a footbridge leading from Ulitsa Starovilenskaya in the historic Trinity district of Minsk. The monument is accessible any time by crossing the small bridge from the riverbank. There is also a lovely statue of a weeping angel on the island."
28,Statue Of Lenin,"Brest, Belarus","Nearly three decades since the fall of the Soviet Union, the hero of the USSR still stands over Belarus.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/statue-of-lenin-2,"Belarus has always been an anomaly amongst the post soviet states. Nostalgia for the USSR and the memories of a bygone era are manifested in various statues and memorials relating to the former Soviet Union found around the country. Outside a government building, a statue of Vladimir Lenin looms over the square, looking powerfully into the distance. However, the Belarus under the statue’s careful watch is now an independent state and far from the Soviet Union Lenin once knew."
29,Chachersk Airplane,"Čačersk, Belarus",A decommissioned Soviet airplane has been used as a movie theater and a cultural center.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chachersk-airplane,"The small town of Chachersk is isolated on all sides because it sits within the area contaminated by fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Nevertheless, right in the middle of town there is one peculiar attraction: a midcentury Soviet airplane. Permanently parked just off the main road down the street from the town hall, even some locals ask themselves how the aircraft ʻʻlanded” here. During Belarus’ Soviet days it was common to put large machinery on literal pedestals after they were retired, as a testament to Communist industry. You can find trucks, cars, tanks, concrete mixers and littered across Belarusian cities, but few are as striking as the Chachersk airplane. It is a Soviet Tupolev Tu-124, a sibling of the Tu-104, the world’s first successful jet airliner. These planes flew the skies between 1962 and 1980. They seated 56 passengers and were equipped with parachutes to be used in an emergency landing. Before it was decommissioned the the plane was used by the Soviet Union Ministry of Defence. Afterward, it mysteriously ended up as a ʻʻmonument” in Chachersk. The nearest airport is about 100 kilometers away. When it first arrived the airplane was used as a movie theater. Nowadays it is used as a local culture centre for exhibitions and education of handicrafts, for instance, knitting. Chechersk is easy to find on the highway Gomel–Mogilev. About 45 kilometers from Gomel you have to take right (P38 road) and after another 15 kilometers you will reach the destination. Both objects are located near the central road. Be aware that many areas around the city are uninhabited due to the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl catastrophe in 1986. Thus it is not recommended to stray from the main road and venture into forests."
30,Museum of Stones,"Minsk, Belarus",A unique park tells the geological history of Belarus in a national “map” of thousands of boulders and blue spruce.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-stones,"At first glance it seems like an ordinary park, until you notice the unusual number of boulders. This is the Museum of Stones, an open-air geological gallery created during the waning years of the Cold War to celebrate the unique topography of Belarus. The 18-acre Museum, just outside of central Minsk, gathered thousands of carefully chosen boulders from every corner of the country, including some with ancient carvings, and curated them into a singular vision. Together with molded land formations and tree plantings, the park forms a kind of large-scale national map. It was designed in the mid-1980s by a team from the National Academy of Sciences to replicate features of the Belarusian landscape, by using the placement of 2,135 stones, paths, blue spruce, and varying elevations. The ambitious project (the scale of the “map” is 2000:1 in the horizontal plane, and 100:1 in the vertical) had only gotten started at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the wake of the post-communist chaos, funding dried up, and where there had been hope for explanatory signage, docent-led tours, and well-run support facilities, there are now weedy paths, graffiti, and stolen signs. Still, the park is a popular spot for picnics and kids to climb, and many of the “exhibits” have secret stories to tell. There is a “Boris Stone” (one of several mysterious boulders that were discovered around the River Dvina with medieval inscriptions), and others with carvings of both Paganism and early Christianity. Some represent minerals commonly found in Belarus, and many, by their composition, reveal their long glacial journey from the Arctic tens of thousands of years ago. It may look like a bunch of big rocks, but first glances can be deceiving. The Museum of Stones is found just outside of the Minsk Beltway on the eastern side of the city, a short walk from the Uručča (Уручье) metro station. It's located in a park open 24/7 and there is no admission fee."
31,Khatyn Memorial Complex,"Lahoisk District, Belarus",A symbolic graveyard for the villages that perished during the Nazi invasion of Belarus.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khatyn-memorial-complex,"The Khatyn Memorial Complex is built on the former site of Khatyn village, and represents the many hundreds of homesteads destroyed in the Khatyn and similar massacres during World War II. In January 1966, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarus built the memorial complex in memory of the hundreds of Belorussian villages destroyed by Nazis during this period, making it the most significant war memorial in Belarus. Sadly, the Khatyn massacre was not an unusual incident in Belarus during the second World War. At least 5,295 Belarusian settlements were burned, destroyed by the Nazis and some or all their inhabitants were killed as a punishment for collaboration with partisans. In the Vitebsk region 243 villages were burned down twice, 83 villages three times, and 22 villages were burned down four or more times. In the Minsk region 92 villages were burned down twice, 40 villages three times, nine villages four times, and six villages five or more times. Altogether, over two million people were killed in Belarus during the three years of Nazi occupation, almost a quarter of the country’s population. In memory of lives lost, each individual village destroyed is represented and those that have been since repopulated are honored by their names in tree sculptures, representing new life and survival. Bells ring every 30 seconds to commemorate the rate at which Belarusian lives were lost throughout the duration of the war. Possibly the most affecting piece in the complex is the statue of Yuzif Kaminsky, the only adult survivor of the Khatyn massacre. The 56-year-old was wounded, burnt, and left for dead during the killings, but recovered consciousness after the executioners had left. The statue shows him holding the body of his young son in his arms.  The memorial complex of Khatyn is situated in Logoisk region of Minsk area, Belarus 223110. There is a sign for the memorial on the 54th km of the Minsk-Vitebsk (M3) motorway. The car park and complex are located 5km after turning into the complex and driving through the woods."
32,The Blue Forest,"Halle, Belgium","Each spring, a dreamlike carpet of bluebells overtakes the forest floor.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-blue-forest-halle-belgium,"Visit this Belgian forest at just the right time in the spring, and you’ll feel as if you’ve stepped into a dream. The Hallerbos—also known as the Blue Forest—is covered with millions of bluebells from late April into May. The otherworldly transformation of the 1,360-acre woods has a floral carpet brushing up against the lean beech trees as far as your eye takes you. Visitors can stroll the winding paths, and watch for rabbits and deer that wander through the green and azure woods. While the woods, located in the Halle municipality between Flanders and Wallonia, is not far from Brussels, it’s often overlooked by visitors. The phenomenon of “bluebell forests” is not uncommon in Europe, particularly in its oldest woods, but the Hallerbos is unique for the density and beauty of its blooms. While Hallerbos is mostly known for its bluebells, the forest features nature of all kinds in every season including oak, ash, pine, beech, giant sequoia and larch trees. As well as wildlife such as squirrels, foxes and almost 100 different species of birds.  The entrance is on the Chemin du Bois de Halle off of Exit 22 on Brussels Ring Road. You can also take TEC bus 115A to the Vlasmarkt stop and take Vlasmarktdreef to the woods. The Blue Forest (Hallerbos) is about a 30 minute drive from Brussels."
33,Royal Greenhouses of Laeken,"Brussels, Belgium",Lavish royal estate punctuated with heated greenhouses.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/royal-greenhouses-of-laeken,"King Leopold II of Belgium is most well known for creating the Congo Free State in the late 19th century. When Leopold was not establishing colonial settlements and exploiting native populations, he was building lavish royal estates punctuated with tremendous heated greenhouses. The most impressive of Leopold’s creations in Brussels is the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken on the grounds of the Palace of Laeken built between 1884 and 1886. It is an extravagant creation, complete with thirty pavilions connected to the prize of the complex, the Winter Gardens. Towering over the grounds, the beautiful glass dome of the garden shines royally above all else. Inside, the beauty is no less impressive. Exotic tropical plants make up a sizable portion of the gardens. However, the standouts of the collection are the azaleas and geraniums, which, when in bloom, brightly light up the corridors of the garden, catching the sunlight and pleasing every side of the senses. Oddly enough, the impressive Winter Gardens of the complex are also called the Greenhouse of Congo and feature many tropical plants the king undoubtedly encountered during his time in Africa. This strange link between the king’s colonized territory and his excess in Belgium starkly contrast, and highlight the grim realities of the colonization Leopold essentially popularized in the late 1800s. Keeping with the exclusive and royal nature of the gardens, the Laeken Greenhouses are only open for two weeks per year in late April and early May. Fortunately, those two weeks usually fall in line with the majority of flowers blooming in the Winter Gardens. Easily accessible from the city center of Belgium. It's only open to the public for three weeks in spring."
34,Reading Between The Lines,"Borgloon, Belgium","Part modern art project, part traditional chapel, this see-through church is only substantial from the right angle.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/reading-between-the-lines,"From inside the Gijs Van Vaerenbergh-designed art church known as Reading Between The Lines, the natural sunlight hits the ground in a noirish checkerboard, belying the construction’s almost completely insubstantial walls. However, from any other angle, the building seems like a solid little chapel. Basing their design on the traditionally built local chapel in Limburg, Belgium, the architectural duo created their church in 2011 in conjunction with the art museum Z33. The single-steepled house of worship is set atop a concrete foundation on which 100 layers of stacked steel forms create the semi-transparent walls. Each layer is separated from another by over 2,000 squat steel columns. The net effect of the odd metal construction is that when viewed directly from any side of the church, its walls appear to be roughly see-through. However if the viewer sees walls from a higher or lower angle, the structure is suddenly solid. All said, the welded wonder weighs over 30 tons. Effectively a giant optical illusion, Reading Between The Lines serves as not only a statement about the permanence of architecture but also the relative sturdiness of church institutions themselves by creating a quiet place of reflection where one is at once removed from and exposed to the outside world."

Le Cercueil was unleashed onto the world in 1974 following the release of the horror movie, “The Exorcist.” The decor, featuring grim reapers and dark skeletons, creates a morbid atmosphere in this unique tavern. The only thing creepier than placing your skull-shaped beer mug on a coffin is the nomenclature of the cocktails. Sit back and sip on your choice of corpse juice, devil’s sperm, and vampire blood. The bar offers a speed-dating service but beware, the ultraviolet neon lights give potential lovers an eerie corpse-like appearance."
36,Gravensteen,"Ghent, Belgium",This fairytale castle was built as a show of power but was nearly torn down thanks to its history of torture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gravensteen-2,"Constructed over the site of a much weaker looking wooden castle by a pompous count, the fairytale fortress known as Gravensteen became a house of torture and injustice from the 12th-century and was almost torn down later on due to the memory of those atrocities. While a much smaller castle existed on the site prior to the construction of Gravensteen, it was the ostentatious Count Philip of Alsace who created the lovely, if imposing fortress that remains today. The fort was originally constructed as a symbol of the power of the Count of Flanders, it was Philip, who had fought in the Crusades and seen a number of grand castles in his travels, who insisted that the walls and towers of the castle be built to such a height that their very presence would let everyone know just how much money and influence their position held. Gravensteen is often called the Castle of the Counts for this reason. Eventually, the counts abandoned their seat in the 14th century and the castle became simply a prison and courthouse. It featured multiple courthouses and subterranean dungeons in which criminals and accused simply awaiting trial were kept in unlivable conditions and frequently tortured. While the barbaric activities were abandoned as the area became more civilized in the ensuing centuries, the site never lost the taint of the horrors that were once perpetrated within its walls. By the end of the 1800s, the structure had become unsound and its reputation was doing nothing for it in the court of public opinion, thus Gravensteen was nearly razed. Luckily a preservation group realized the architectural and (however horrible) historical importance and managed to save the castle. Today, the site has been greatly restored still retaining a decorative moat on three sides, and is open to the public, even featuring a torture museum, possibly as some sort of mea culpa. Despite its grim past, Gravensteen is still one of the most stunning historic castles remaining in the world. Update May 2019: As of May 2018, the torture museum no longer exists. There were some renovations carried out and the implements of torture are now reduced to a few remaining examples displayed behind a plexiglass barricade.  The audio guide is included in the ticket price. Quite popular, the guide tells you a lively story of the castle's history. Available in English & Dutch."
37,The Atomium,"Brussels, Belgium",Climb inside an iron crystal magnified 165 billion times its normal size.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-atomium-brussels-belgium,"In 1958 the Atomium was built for the Brussels World’s Fair and never intended to be a permanent part of the Brussels landscape, but like the Eiffel tower for the French, once the fair was over the Belgians wanted to keep the giant structure. Essentially the Atomium is a 335-foot-tall giant iron crystal, replicated in shiny steel. It is formed by nine spheres arranged in the the shape that iron atoms take in their delta and alpha allotropes. (In iron’s gamma allotrope, there are extra atoms at the center of each face of the cube.) The Atomium is magnified 165 billion times the normal size of an iron crystal. Designed by André Waterkeyn (the director of a federation of metallurgical companies and not a sculptor by trade), one of the original ideas had been to build an upside down version of the Eiffel Tower, but in keeping with a 1950s atomic age theme, they built the Atomium. The Atomium was recently renovated and all but three of the steel spheres are available to enter and contain everything from an exhibition space, to a restaurant, to a place for Belgian school kids to have sleepovers. Nearby the Atomium is  Mini-Europe, a theme park featuring miniature replicas of European monuments. The Atomium is located in the Northern part of the city of Brussels, a 5 minute walk from the Heysel / Heizel metro station (line 6) and right opposite Mini-Europe."

Brussels is known as the home of “bande dessinée” or “comic strips,” specifically those targeted at a Franco-Belgian audience. The comic book culture in the area has roots going back further than many American comic properties, and a wide number of genre and independent comics have flourished in stark contrast to the American superhero boom. A number of these properties have become cultural institutions and their creators such as Hergé and Dupuy and Berberian have become internationally known figures. Beginning in 1991, the large paintings of such famous European comic characters as Asterix, Tintin, and the assassin XIII. Each of the works towers over the streets below some creating whole scenes with backgrounds and little pieces of implied action while others are simply character portraits. While none of the murals were painted by the original artists, the styles have been aped so expertly no one would ever know. There are currently over 50 murals dotting downtown Brussels (an area known as the “Pentagon”), and a few more of the works have also started appearing in nearby cities.

Thanks to him and his Peruvian wife, who you are surely to meet once inside, a truly interesting combination of live performance and libation awaits. As Retsin, a self-described “vampire,” describes it, his house originally housed a chapter of the Freemasons during the time of Napoleon. However during his residence in the space, he has refurbished the rich interior to resemble a living cabinet of curiosities. The walls are covered in huge portraits of vaguely sinister figures like something out of a particularly ominous nightmare, and the surfaces are covered in countless statues and figures that seem to have been collected from a wide range of eras and areas (and possibly horror dimensions). Retsin himself consideres the space to act as a sort of museum. There is also a distinctly Cuban flavor to much of the space and the events inside with rich rum cocktails served from the old bar and Latin music playing. This owes to Retsin’s professed past of textile trading in Central America. Regardless of the origins, the sense of Havana nights decadence pervades the home although it has been filtered through the morbid sensibility of a living oddity/most interesting man in the world. Today The Lucifernum is open to the public on Sundays from 8 p.m to 11p.m. when daring party animals can ring the bell and be welcomed into the vampire’s lair."
40,Délirium Café,"Brussels, Belgium","Cozy basement bar sports an inventory of over 2,000 beers.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/delirium-cafe,"Tucked away on a cobblestone backstreet in the heart of Brussels is the Délirium Café. Its bold name stems from the Belgian pale ale Delirium Tremens, and the front doors sport painted pink elephants in honor of the “Best Beer in the World.” Located in the café’s basement, this bar’s walls are plastered with ad-panels, posters and neon signs from over the years. Beer trays from all over the world are nailed chaotically to the ceiling, and glass display cases filled to capacity with special edition beer glasses encircle the room. Known for it’s hefty beverage selection, this bar offers a collection of over 2,000 beers and is quite popular among the college crowd. The menu resembles a mathematics textbook in size and organizes the beers by country of origin, as well as alcohol content. Although the beer list can be overwhelming, the bartenders have extensive knowledge on the beverages they serve and are always willing to give their own advice on what to order. The Délirium Café also offers a wide selection of delicious cheeses and sausages, as well as a fully-stocked water bar for those that don’t drink alcohol."
41,The Musical Instrument Museum,"Brussels, Belgium",Three floors of musical instruments coming from all corners of the world and hundreds of years of musical history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-musical-instrument-museum-in-brussels-brussels-belgium,"Located in central Brussels, the Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) is part of the Royal Museum for Art and History. Renowned for its collection of over 1,500 instruments, the museum showcases the instruments and provides visitors with free headphones to experience their “vibes” (visitors are given infrared headphones in order to listen to almost 200 musical extracts of the instruments on display). The museum’s collection represents Belgian musical history (including Brussels’ importance in the making of recorders in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and as the home of instrument inventor Adolphe Sax in the nineteenth century), European musical traditions, and non-European instruments. Mechanical instruments are shown in the basement, traditional instruments on the ground floor, the development of the modern orchestral instruments on the first floor, and keyboard and stringed instruments on the second floor. The museum also has a sound lab where visitors can experiment with various instruments. Among the notable pieces of the collection are the famous Rottenburgh Alto recorder, instruments invented by Adolphe Sax, a unique set of giant Chinese stone chimes, and the only existing copy of the luthéal, an instrument used by Ravel. Information is provided in French and Dutch, though not in English.  The museum is open 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Tuesday to Friday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends. The Brussels Card is valid in the museum so holders can enter at no extra cost. The MiM is easy to find on the Mont des Arts. To reach the museum by bus or tram, head to the Royale or Palais stops. Gare-Centrale (Central Station) is just around the corner for visitors coming by train or Metro. There is also a cafe on the top level with lovely views if you can get a window table."
42,The Doomed City of Doel,"Beveren, Belgium",This ghost town in Belgium will lose its street art when it ceases to exist.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/doel,"In the very near future, Doel, Belgium will only exist in pictures and memories. The tiny village is scheduled to be completely destroyed to make room for an expanding harbor, and even protest and the incredible street art in the abandoned town cannot stop the inevitable destruction. For 700 years, Doel stood near Antwerp along the Scheldt River in Belgium, and includes a home that once belonged to the family of painter Peter Paul Reubens. As Antwerp expanded in the 20th century, its port needed more space, and Doel quickly became a target for demolition. Trying to force residents out, the government scheduled demolitions multiple times, but were beaten by popular protests from the 1970s through the 1990s. But despite the will of the people, Doel could not be saved and in 1999, the town was officially scheduled for complete demolition. In 2007,  a campaign group called Doel 2020 set into motion a plan to ensure Doel’s survival by turning it into a haven for street artists. Since that time, residents have trickled out as artists have made their way in. The increasingly abandoned town became the perfect playground for street artists from across Europe to debut their works around Doel. Today, there are only about 25 inhabitants left of the original 1,300, all of whom are bravely flaunting mandates that they vacate their homes immediately. Meanwhile the town has been transformed into a post-apocalyptic artistic paradise thanks to the murals covering each and every building. Despite these people’s stubborn refusal to leave, the government plans to continue with demolition, at which point all traces of Doel, from residents’ homes to the the living street art, will be lost forever. You can see some lovely drone shots of Doel in this video.  Going inside of the buildings is prohibited, though it can be managed. There are police patrols from time to time, so watch out for those. The fall was a perfect time to go because of the contrast between the grey weather, abandoned buildings and the colorful plants creeping in through the windows and such. It is not possible to drive into Doel itself unless you are a resident. A sign at the vehicle barrier on the N451 road reminds potential visitors that Doel is still an inhabited village and asks that the residents be respected."
43,Abbaye de Villers,"Genappe, Belgium",A magical and peaceful ruined Cistercian abbey in what is now southern Belgium.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abbaye-de-villers,"In the early 17th century, Crisóstomo Henríquez told the story of the famous Villers Abbey. By 1796, the abbey was abandoned. Built in 1146, a dozen monks and 3 lay brothers came from Clairvaux to the Walloon Brabant province of Wallonia to establish a Cistercian abbey. After a few false starts in what turned out to be less than ideal locations, abbaye de Villers started to come together, and although it took 70 years, the abbey came to fruition when the refectory was finally finished in 1267. Despite the incredibly slow start, the abbey soon showed itself to be worth the weight, over the next few centuries, it housed up to 100 monks and 300 lay brothers at a time, its grounds swelling to 100 acres. It wasn’t until the 16th century that the holy place started to lose ground. Spanish tercios, dwindling funds and a shortage of monks did considerable damage to the abbey, but it was the French Revolution that finally put the ancient monastery out to pasture. The building was completely abandoned by 1796, and when a railway line was built through the grounds in 1855, the abbey and the acreage it sat on fell even further into disrepair. Disregarded for almost 100 years, the state of Belgium finally stepped in, bought the property and began conservation efforts, which kicked into a considerably higher gear by the 1970s once it was declared an official historic site. Now maintained regularly by the Association pour la Promotion Touristique et Culturelle de Villers, its former Cistercian-style beauty is being revisited in several of the outbuildings including the dorms, kitchen, refectory, cloister, and most importantly, the brewing house. Now you can bring a picnic lunch and wander the grounds of this ancient piece of history being brought back to life. Better yet, explore as you sample some of Belgium’s finest beers in the local Le Moulin de Villers restaurant across the street from the abbey grounds. Guided visits, activity days, and a variety of concerts and choral arrangements are offered in this serene place of worship being raised from the dead.  - E411 highway (exit 9), N25 direction Nivelles (Villers-la-Ville exit) - or E19 highway (exit 19), Nivelles ring road R24 direction Wavre, N25 (Villers-la-Ville exit) - or E42 highway (exit 16b), N5 direction Waterloo, after Baisy-Thy, direction Villers-la-Ville Free parking for cars and tour buses Site accessible to buses with a max. height of 3.50 m.

44,Mini-Europe,"Brussels, Belgium",Theme park featuring miniature replicas of European monuments.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mini-europe,"True to its name, Mini-Europe is a theme park featuring miniature, 1:25 scale models of monuments in the European Union. Located in Brussels, Belgium, Mini-Europe lies at the base of the Atomium which is in the reverse scale, a model of an iron crystal lattice magnified 165 million times. The park was created in 1989 and features 350 monuments and live action models, including the Leaning Tower of Pisa, an erupting Mount Vesuvius, and Big Ben including its famous chimes. The buildings represent roughly 80 cities in the EU, most of which were financed by their respective countries or regions. Though the buildings might be small in size, much attention to detail has been paid in their creation. With the exception of a few stone structures, most of the monuments were created using a silicone mold and epoxy resin or polyester casts. The Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela took 24,000 hours to build, and the Grand Place of Brussels cost roughly €350,000 to complete. Additionally, the park features a new interactive exhibition, the “Spirit of Europe,” which shares EU history through multimedia games.  Mini-Europe is one of four attractions at Bruparck. It closes annually from mid-January until early March, but reopens each spring."
45,The Belgian Centre for Comic Strip Art,"Brussels, Belgium","From Tintin to the Smurfs, Europe's greatest graphic icons are celebrated in a grand Art Noveau gallery.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/centre-belge-de-la-bande-dessin-e,"The Belgian Centre for Comic Strip Art, or Centre Belge de la Bande Dessinée, is a kind of hall of fame of European comic book arts. Comic albums are a distinct and revered cultural institution in the Franco-Belgian world, with a variety of genres and styles catering to a diverse audience. Brussels has been the epicenter of the comic art form since the early-20th century, and a great source of talent. The influence of Franco-Belgian comic style has spilled over to the rest of the continent defining a distinct European comic book tradition. The Belgian Center for Comic Strip Art exhibits the works of some of the greatest European masters of the art, from Hergé (the creator of The Adventures of Tintin) to Peyo (the Smurfs), and from Franquin (Spirou, Gaston, Marsoupilami) to Uderzo and Goscinny (Asterix). Temporary exhibits also explore the latest developments in the world of both European comics and comic traditions from other continents. Perhaps the main highlight of the permanent exhibition is the array of original drawings by comic grandmasters. A section devoted to the origins and evolutionary history of the art form grounds visitors in the wonderful world of comics. The extensive gallery of the prints, organized according to historic styles and genres, details the creative process from script to the final published album. The center also contains a well-stocked international comic book shop and a study library with the biggest collection of comic book titles in the world. The center is in the heart of the Brussels, housed in a stylish Art Nouveau building designed by famous Victor Horta. Statues of comic icons provide additional decoration and great photo opportunities for visitors young and old alike. The nearest train station is Bruxelles-Congres around the corner, though Gare Centrale (Central Station) is also close. The nearest Metro stops are Gare-Centrale and Botanique.Information around the exhibits is provided in French, Dutch and English and guidebooks for other languages are available for free upon arrival.The Brussels Card is valid here and travellers who've bought a card can enter without paying the standard entry fee. Unlike many of Brussels' museums the Center is open on Mondays which, though convenient for tourists, means it is likely to be busier on that particular day.The Center is open from 10am to 6pm daily."
46,Zinneke Pis,"Brussels, Belgium",Meet the bronze beloved pet to a family of famous peeing statues.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zinneke-pis,"Brussels’ Manneken Pis statue is one of the most famous sculptural images icons in the entire world. Recreations of the famed pissing baby can be found in gardens and fountains all over the world. The appeal of a naked little boy draining the snake can not be underestimated apparently. Lesser known, however, is that the Manneken Pis not only has a female counterpart, Jeanneke Pis, but also a dog known as Zinneke Pis, who is forever lifting his leg onto a Brussels street pole. Zinneke Pis was installed on the corner of Rue des Chartreux and Rue du Vieux Marché aux grains in 1998, centuries after his symbolic master was installed in the city in 1619. Like the little boy and the little girl, the pup was created life-size, but unlike its masters, the Zinneke Pis is not actually a pissing fountain, it is simply a bronze statue. Nonetheless, the metal canine is just as cute, looking a little guilty as he lets loose on the street corner. The bronze buddy is not as well known as his masters, but if people could catch on to his adorable little face, it is no doubt that gardens around the world would be covered in peeing dog statues in no time. The creator of the dog also lives in the neighborhood, and he modeled it after his own pet, which can still be seen occasionally wandering the area. It is not known how often the real dog pisses in the street, but it can be well assumed that it is not as often as the eternally micturating Zinneke Pis. Also, it’s a boy."
47,Caves of Remouchamps,"Remouchamps, Belgium",Hiding the longest subterranean river known in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/caves-of-remouchamps,"Located in Belgium, the Caves of Remouchamps has among its many wonders the longest subterranean river known in the world. Opened in 1912 and originally equipped with torches, the caves are explored in two parts. The first is a long walk to a grand “cathedral”, followed by an hour and a half boat ride down the caves’ quiet and entirely underground river, the Rubicon. Floating down the underground river gives the impression of an entering a lost underground fairy kingdom. The history of the Caves of Remouchamps is also quite unique. Some 8,000 years ago, Paleolithic hunters sheltered themselves in the cave, and much later, the same area was used as a wine shelter, and a shelter during World War II. Throughout the cave there are a handful of remarkable sites for visitors to see. Bat sightings are a treat for guests and while drifting on the Rubicon, look closely for the niphargus, a blind, translucent shrimp. Many stalactites and stalagmites decorate the interior of the passageways, one famously noted for its resemblance to the Virgin Mary."
48,Stari Most,"Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina",Bridge that died in war and was resurected.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stari-most,"The Bosnian War of the early 1990s had many victims, both human and architectural. One of the best known among these was the Old Bridge of Mostar. Once one of the most iconic landmarks of Bosnia and the old Yugoslav federation, the bridge was destroyed by Croatian armed forces on November 9, 1993. The bridge, a masterpiece of Ottoman Turkish architecture, was commissioned by none other then Suleiman the Magnificent, and designed by Mimar Hayruddin, a student of the famous Mimar Sinan. The construction began in 1557 and took nine years to complete. Elegant in its simplicity, the bridge consists of a single 30-meter-wide and 24-meter-high arc, connecting the steep riverbanks of Neretva river. Two towers protect the entrances to the bridge. These massive stone structures stand in sharp contrast to the streamlined silhouette of the bridge, only emphasizing its beauty. The surrounding city of Mostar even owes its name to the bridge, “most” meaning bridge in Serbo-Croatian. After the end of the Bosnian War, the bridge was reconstructed from 2001 to 2004. Much of original stone were salvaged from the bottom of the river. The rest was replaced with new blocks quarried from the same locations used for the original construction. A coalition of international organizations led by the World Bank and UNESCO financed the reconstruction. Diving into river from the highest point of the bridge has been a test of courage for local young men for as long as anyone can remember. Tourists can pay locals to make the dive for their viewing pleasure. Official annual bridge-jumping competitions started in 1968 and are still held each summer. In 2015, the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series was held in Mostar.  Frequent buses from Sarajevo (3 hours). Stunning views."
49,Kravice Waterfalls,"Studenci, Bosnia and Herzegovina","There's a mini version of Iguazu Falls hidden in the Balkans, and it's got a rope swing.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kravice-waterfalls,"Situated on the Trebižat River amidst Europe’s last jungle lies a series of waterfalls that conjure images more in keeping with the Swiss Family Robinson than those traditionally Balkan. Plunging from cliffs as high as 83 feet into a natural, watery amphitheater that is almost 500 feet across, the series of waterfalls at Kravice are nestled in a natural reserve southwest of the city of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The collective impression created is one of a more approachable, kid sister to the thunderous Iguazu Falls spanning Brazil and Argentina’s border that remains less visited, and unspoiled in a way its big brother can no longer claim. The rapids at the base of the falls aren’t particularly dangerous even in the springtime, and no lifeguards are charged with policing activities. This makes the natural swimming holes at Kravice local favorites despite the water’s year-round chilly temperature. As if bathing beneath cascading waters and leaping from rock to rock weren’t enough, a rope swing has even been added for bonus kicks. With a bar on its banks, a classic mill and old sailing ship moored in the lake at its base, Kravice Falls leaves nothing wanting. Tour groups can be hired to bring you to Kravice, but part of the joy in experiencing Kravice Falls is its general lack of crowds, which means joining a large cluster of strangers bound for the falls may just defeat the purpose of the place. Knowledgable visitors instead recommend renting a car from Mostar or negotiating taxi service to and from the woods, the latter of which merely adds to the adventure by tossing in the fun of haggling over price.  Head south-west out of Mostar following signs towards Krusevo and follow the road all the way to Ljubuski. Turn left towards Studenci. About 10kms from the turn look for a brown sign pointing to a left side road advertising Kravice Falls. Follow it until it ends (approximately 3km) at the parking lot."
50,Watermills of Jajce,"Jezero, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This cluster of little wooden huts once ground local farmers’ wheat into flour during the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/watermills-of-jajce,"Jajce, in the central region of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is a historic city all about falling water. Famous for its enormous waterfall in the middle of town, the meeting of two rivers – the Pliva and the Vrbas – established the region in the 14th century as the capital of the then Kingdom of Bosnia.  There’s a town castle, old fortified city walls, high mountains and deep river valleys. And just downstream, in the area of the Pliva Lakes, is a collection of about 20 little huts that once served as watermills for local farmers. The little windowless huts sit on top of skinny stilts right over the gushing water. Since the flow here is spread out, by using a series of little mills instead of one big water wheel, the diffuse water power could be aggregated. Pretty ingenious. Most of the huts go back to the period of the Austro-Hungarian empire (about 1867 to 1918), and they give the impression of a little storybook village. No longer used for actual milling, the Pliva Lakes watermills draw tourists down the river from the giant waterfall in town. That one is certainly impressive with its showy 65-foot drop. But the little shingled watermills feel like they might be home to some local trolls, with their dragons hitched up out back. About 3 miles (5km) west of Jajce, following the M5 to Plivka Lakes Park"
51,Sarajevo Bobsleigh Track,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",A war-torn Olympic relic is being overtaken by graffiti and nature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sarajevo-bobsleigh-track,"Once a proud feature of Sarajevo’s 1984 Winter Olympic games, the bobsleigh track has since fallen into ruin after being the victim of military actions. The 1300-meter concrete track was completed in 1982 and featured a total of 13 turns for the lugers to navigate. The expensive public work paid off for the country after the events around the site during the Olympics garnered enormous crowds. The track was able to be reused during World Cup competitions in later years following the winter games and it appeared that the long track would continue to pay dividends. Unfortunately when the Yugoslav Wars began in 1991, the track, like the rest of the country, became embroiled in the fighting. The curled turns were used as defensive positions for Bosnian forces, and the whole of the track became pocked with bullet holes and other wounds. Today, the track still stands as a favorite spot for local graffiti artists who have decorated whole swaths of the curving lane. The Sarajevo Bobsleigh Track is a literal concrete reminder of a more prosperous time. It is currently under re-construction for future bobsleigh competitions but official guided tours are still available.  Do not wander around this area alone or without a local who knows it perfectly; there are still many unexploded mines littering the hillside. Venturing off the established paths is not advised. However, many travelers do hike this medium-difficult trek through the houses on Mount Trebević. Alternatively, there are tours which cater for those who do not want to hike or local buses which go three-quarters of the way there. You can also hire a taxi and your driver may act as your tour guide for the trip, just be patient and negotiate the price before getting in. The easiest way to reach the track is now via the recently refurbished cable car. The way is signposted with maps from the cable car exit."
52,Tjentiste War Memorial,"Tjentište, Bosnia and Herzegovina",These warring psychedelic crags commemorate an unsuccessful military operation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tjeniste-war-memorial,"One of the many otherworldly monuments that dot the Bosnian landscape, the rocky passage of the Tjentiste War Memorial is a stunning tribute to a total failure. The two fractal walls of the memorial were erected in the 1970’s to remember Operation Fall Schwarz, otherwise known as the Battle of the Sutjeska. The military action took place during World War II and saw Axis forces attempt to rout a group of Yugoslavian forces and capture their leader. The complicated battle saw most of the Yugoslav forces able to escape, including their leader, foiling the Nazis’ plan, which was actually the second attempt at the same strategy. While the the Axis’ plan was a failure, it was not without tragedy. Over 7,000 people were killed, mostly just citizens who could not escape with the majority of the Yugoslavian military forces. To remember both the Nazi failure and the tragic loss of life, the abstract war memorial was constructed. Like many of the memorials constructed in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 70’s the monument is an angular abstraction constructed from bleak grey cement. However despite the tragic roots and brutalist construction, the majestic strangeness of the Tjentiste War Memorial cannot be denied. Stay on the M-20. You can't miss it."
53,ARK D-0: Tito's Nuclear Bunker,"Konjic, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This top-secret nuclear bunker hidden in a Bosnian mountain has been converted to a modern art exhibition space.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ark-d-0-tito-s-nuclear-bunker,"Behind a seemingly ordinary house along the river Neretva outside of Konjic in Bosnia-Herzegovina lies a forgotten bunker, hidden right in the mountain. Built at the behest of Yugoslav revolutionary and “benevolent dictator,” Josip Tito, the nuclear bunker officially known as ARK (Atomska Ratna Komanda, Atomic War Command) D-0 was a well-kept secret for decades. The construction started in March of 1953 and wasn’t finished until 26 years later in September of 1979. It is all hidden behind what seems to be an ordinary house, and stretching 663 feet into the mountain with over 919 feet of rock on top of it, at the thickest point. The whole complex is built in a horseshoe shape, resembling a maze with offices, conference rooms, dorms and of course, Tito’s private rooms. It was all supported by two kitchens and a supply of oil, food. and water that could sustain the bunker for up to six months. In the event of a nuclear strike, the bunker could accommodate Tito and 350 of the most important political and military persons in the country. The importance of this facility is clear when considering the measures that were taken to keep it a secret. For one, all of the workers were blindfolded when being transported to the building site, only being allowed to remove it once inside. In September 1979, when the construction was finished, only 16 people knew of the bunker’s existence - three generals and 13 soldiers serving the facility. All of them had taken an oath to preserve the secret location. The building of ARK D-0 was costly, and not just in the monetary sense. Apart from the $4.6 billion invested in the construction, it also took a lot of lives. According to the testimonies of some of the workers, not a single shift passed without a fatality. ARK D-0 exists today only because of the Bosnian military guard, who refused to carry out an order from Serbian high command in Belgrade, who wanted to blow up the bunker up in 1992. Thanks to this forward thinking bit of preservation, the bunker is still in much the same condition as it was during the Yugoslav era with all of its furniture and equipment intact. In addition to acting as a time capsule from a more paranoid time, the bunker is also home of a contemporary art biennial called D-0 ARK Underground. So the bunker, once built for a small circle of the Yugoslavian elite and close to being destroyed forever, is the home of a contemporary art exhibition. It’s said that Tito never came to visit the bunker but one can imagine that this was not what he had in mind for the future of ARK D-0.  ARK D-0 is located in a military facility on the east side of the river Neretva south of Konjic. The area is a military compound, so you can only visit with a guided tour. Tours are available via www.visitkonjic.com"
54,Sarajevo War Tunnel Museum,"Ilidža, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This museum preserves the hand-dug tunnel that kept Sarajevo afloat during the Serbian siege.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sarajevo-war-tunnel-museum,"During a large portion of the 1990s Sarajevo was under siege by Serbian forces who controlled almost the entire city. However, Bosniak loyalists built a tunnel which would secretly supply much of the rest of the city during the occupation. Begun in January of 1993 under the codename “Objekt BD,” the tunnel was built to link the Bosnian neighborhoods of Butmir and Dobrinja under a Serbian-controlled aircraft runway. The crude tunnel was dug by hand and shovel from both sides, by workers who chiseled away at the earth in eight-hour shifts. The clandestine laborers, who were paid in cigarettes, had to contend with near constant shelling and underground water which would rise to waist high in the cramped tunnel and had to be emptied one bucket at a time. The two tunnels finally met in July of 1993 creating an 800-meter lifeline between the two neighborhoods. Once completed the tunnel had an average height of one and half meters, and was shored up with tons of steel and concrete. A small railway was finally built into the floor and crucial food, gas, and weapons were finally able to be secreted into the very heart of the siege. After the war ended the tunnel was abandoned, but a museum was built in the building which covered the Dobrinja entrance. The museum displays weaponry and ephemera from the war and allows visitors to explore a short distance into the tunnel. The war may be over, but the Sarajevo War Tunnel Museum makes sure that no one will forget the unstoppable determination and resourcefulness of Sarajevo’s citizens."
55,Čolina Kapa Astronomical Observatory,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",The haunting ruins of a military fortress turned astronomical observatory sit on a Sarajevo mountaintop.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/colina-kapa-astronomical-observatory,"Before World War I, an Austro-Hungarian military fortress was built on Mount Trebević. The mountaintop provided views of the entire city, and was a key point in military observation. After World War II, this lookout point proved useful again, when the fortress was converted into an astronomical observatory. The Orion Astronomical Society established the Čolina Kapa Observatory and worked hard to bring it up to state-of-the-art technological standards. By 1972, it was the only facility of its kind in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its three domes crowned the building waiting for astronomers to observe the night sky, while the fortress below contained all that visiting scholars might need for several days’ stay, including a reference library and a photo lab. Research done at the observatory led to the publishing of a photographic atlas of the North sky compiled from the images taken here. Unfortunately, two decades later in the 1990s much of Sarajevo was devastated by shelling during the Bosnian War. The astronomical observatory was no exception. The Čolina Kapa Observatory and all its instruments were completely destroyed between 1992 and 1995. The area was absolutely shattered by the conflict, and without adequate funding, the observatory was abandoned. Today it remains an important symbol of Sarajevo, as its white building still looks over the city from Mount Trebević, though today the walls are crumbling and decrepit. Though the abandoned building is a popular attraction for urban exploring hikers, most Sarajevans would prefer that the observatory be restored. Without Čolina Kapa, astronomy is virtually non-existant in Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite the fact that the study of the stars reaches back to the 15th century in the region. A fundraising campaign has been launched with the intention of “bringing astronomy back to Sarajevo.”"
56,Museum of the Assassination of Franz Ferdinand,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",The place where WWI started.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-assassination-of-franz-ferdinand,"On the 28th of June, 1914, Sarajevo found itself in the epicenter of world politics. Gavrilo Princip, an 18-year-old school boy, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir apparent to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This act triggered a chain of events of global magnitude. Europe’s empires were on a collision course for decades, now a clash was inevitable. A month later the world was at war. On that fateful day in June, Princip did not act alone. He was part of a group composed of young men of all three Bosnian nationalities. No less than five assassins awaited the Archduke that morning in Sarajevo. The first three failed in their attempts. Princip succeeded only by chance. The first two assassins watched as the motorcade of the Archduke rolled by, and with bombs and pistols in hand, they failed to act. Finally, a third assassin threw his bomb, but the bomb bounced off the car’s roof and into the street, where it exploded and wounded the crowd. That assassin attempted to swallow a cyanide pill and jump into the river, but he promptly vomited up the pill and as the river was only 4 inches deep he was easily apprehended very much alive. Princip, who was a relatively minor player in the plot, on hearing that the assassination had failed, went to get a sandwich. It was only when he happened to see the motorcade driving by him, that he hastily pulled out his pistol and shot both the Archduke and the Duchess Sophie dead. Franz Ferdinand’s last words were, “Sophie, Sophie! Don’t die! Live for our children!” followed by him repeatedly saying, “It is nothing. It is nothing. It is nothing.” They both died seated upright in the car before they could receive medical attention. Gavrilo Princip died in an Austrian prison awaiting the conclusion of his trial. To most of the world, Gavrilo Princip was a crazy youth deluded by nationalism; fueled by a naive anarchism he became a terrorist. However, in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and later in the Socialist Republic he was seen as a hero. The building on the street corner overlooking Latin Bridge, next to which Princip was standing when he fired the fatal shots, was turned into a museum dedicated to him. The exact spot he was standing was marked by embossed footprints and a memorial plaque was placed on the corner of the street. In 1941 during WWII, the memorial plaque was removed for the first time by the occupying Nazi army. During the war of the 1990’s, the public and official opinion of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand changed. To the Bosnian Muslim population, the events began to be seen as a Serbian plot imposed upon the citizens of Sarajevo. Princip was perceived as a Serb terrorist by them so the museum was shut down, footprints removed, and memorial plaque smashed. In the years following the Bosnian War, the local perception of history flipped one more time. The museum has been reinstated, this time as a museum of the Austro-Hungarian rule in Sarajevo, and a new memorial plaque was placed on the street corner."
57,Old Jewish Cemetery of Sarajevo,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This historic cemetery was inaccessible for several years due to dozens of land mines.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-jewish-cemetery-of-sarajevo,"This large Jewish cemetery was originally founded in 1630 and contains over 3,850 weathered tombstones. For several years, it also contained around 70 land mines. As part of the Ottoman Empire, Sarajevo became a safe haven for Sephardic Jewish refugees following their expulsion from Spain in 1492. A sizeable number of Jews had settled in Sarajevo as soon as the 16th century, prompting the building of a Jewish quarter in the city that included a synagogue, a courtyard, housing, and the cemetery. While the oldest graves here are Sephardic, the cemetery also became a burial ground for Ashkenazi Jews, who arrived in Sarajevo in the late 19th century. The graveyard is particularly notable for the unique shape of its tombstones, which bear the influence of the monumental, medieval Bosnian stećci in their block-like shapes and decorative motifs. The cemetery’s position on the side of Mount Trebevic overlooking the city made it an attractive artillery position during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Held by Bosnian Serbs, it would become the front line, sustaining considerable damage from bullets, explosions, and return-fire from the city below. Before the war’s end in 1995, the site was heavily mined. The Norwegian People’s Aid Society was assigned to clearing the explosives and would remove 60-70 land mines and around 100 pieces of unexploded ordinance before their task was done. The cemetery was finally returned to Sarajevo’s Jewish community for reopening and restoration in September of 1998."
58,Igman Olympic Jumps,"Hadžići, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This abandoned Olympic skiing facility still bears the scars of the Siege of Sarajevo.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/igman-olympic-jumps,"The area around Igman Mountain outside of Sarajevo has been the site of cross-country skiing, the 1984 Winter Olympic ski jump—oh, and some wartime atrocities. Long before the Igman Olympic Jumps were built, the area was already a popular cross-country skiing destination for the nearby locals. When the site was eventually selected as the location for the 1984 Olympic ski jumping facility, construction of a new road started in 1979, followed by the construction of the two concrete jump chutes, the judges’ tower, and the lifts throughout the following years. The completion of the facility in 1983, and the subsequent Olympic Games brought an increased interest in recreational skiing in general, but also ski jumping. However the good times were not to last. Throughout the Siege of Sarajevo (1992-1995) the area around Igman became the scene of fierce fighting (not unlike the bobsled tracks from that same Olympics). Eventually it became a part of the United Nations buffer zone between the belligerents of the Bosnian government and the Army of Republika Srpska, stretching from the Sarajevo airport and out from the city. The angular Olympic pavilion was even used as a backdrop for summary executions. Today the remains of the fighting can still be seen on the ruins of the Olympic facilities; traces of UN symbols still linger on the abandoned judges’ tower, and some of the structures are still riddled with bullet holes. Even though the ski jumping hills are unusable today, there is some activity in the Igman ski resort. Three lifts are open to give access to a handful of usable ski slopes. The Olympic podium has been restored to its original state to cover the bullet holes from the executions, restoring some of the normality to a once popular ski resort plagued by war."
59,Bascarsija,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",Oriental bazaar in the heart of Sarajevo.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bascarsija,"Baščaršija is the main tourist attraction of Sarajevo. Located at the heart of the city, this bazaar is one of Sarajevo’s oldest areas as well as a well-preserved example of oriental architecture in the Balkans. The name Baščaršija is derived from two Turkish words, “baş” meaning “head” or in this case “main,” and “çarşı,” a commercial street. Situated along the northern bank of the Miljacka River, Baščaršija is an oriental bazaar, a maze of narrow streets with small shops where craftsmen make and sell their products. At one time, each street was dedicated to a different type of craft: metalwork, jewellery, pottery and so on. Nowadays, many of the old artisan shops have been converted to souvenir shops and cafes. Many cities and towns in Bosnia have followed the same historical pattern. Townsfolk, craftsmen and merchants whose livelihoods depended greatly on long-distance trade and good relations with the ruling power converted to Islam, while the countryside remained largely Orthodox. Like many oriental cities, Sarajevo was divided into a residential area or “mahala” and a commercial zone or “çarşı” (a “čaršija” in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian.) By Balkan standards, Sarajevo is a relatively new city, founded after the Ottoman conquest. The history of Baščaršija begins in 1462, when Isa-beg Ishaković, Ottoman governor of Bosnia, built a caravanserai, a kind of oriental roadside service station where travellers could find lodging, fodder for horses, exchange money and repair their carts. The golden period of Baščaršija came in the 17th century, when it contained more then a thousand shops practicing over eighty different crafts. In the 19th century, the bazaar suffered a devastating fire which cut its area roughly in half. At that time Bosnia was a province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and imperial authorities wanted to convert Sarajevo into a “modern” European city. Accordingly, they did little to preserve what they saw as a backwards oriental bazaar. After the Second World War, the cultural and historical significance of Baščaršija was reassessed, and it gradually became the symbol of the city again."
60,Garavice Memorial Park,"Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina",A forgotten and crumbling Yugoslav monument to the victims of fascism.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/garavice-memorial-park,"Just outside the town of Bihać, in Bosnia, a somber memorial park marks the place where 12,000 ethnic Serbs and Jews were executed by fascist forces during the Second World War. Axis forces controlled much of the Balkans during the war, and as borders were redrawn the town of Bihać became a part of the fascist-aligned Independent State of Croatia. In June 1941 the new mayor of Bihać, Ljubomir Kvaternik, moved towards homogenizing the town, ruling that all ethnic Serbs and Jews had to leave their homes. Many did, but a great number ignored the order. In July, the mayor called for the arrest of all those who remained. Between July and August that year, thousands of Jewish and Serb civilians of all ages were taken to sites outside the town and executed en masse. One of the largest places of execution was on Garavice Hill—and it was here, decades later, that socialist Yugoslavia would build a monument to the dead. The Garavice Memorial Park to the Victims of Fascist Terror was designed by renowned architect Bogdan Bogdanović, and completed in 1981. It consists of 15 stone columns placed around the crest of Garavice Hill, roughly 15 feet in height and each formed from a series of carved stone blocks. Engravings on the blocks show curious patterns and abstract designs, reminiscent of local folk art. Today, the memorial park is poorly maintained. Some of the pillars were damaged during the conflict in the 1990s, while graffiti stains many of the stones. Unlike other monuments in the nations of former Yugoslavia, where fresh flowers often indicate their contemporary use as memorial sites, the Garavice Memorial Park appears to be largely forgotten. Its antifascist message remains a powerful one though, for those who still choose to visit; and an engraved script on a stone near the entrance to the park reads: “Life is stronger than death, Justice is stronger than crime, Love is stronger than hate.”"
61,Kozara Memorial Monument,"Dera, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This brutalist monument is inscribed with 9921 names of Yugoslav partisans who perished during WWII.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kozara-memorial-monument,"In April of 1942, 4,000 Yugoslavian partisans watched some 40,000 Nazis and local fascist forces head directly towards their location in the city of Dera with the express goal of wiping them from the face of the planet. During the spring of 1942 the Croatian army, Ustaša militia, and the German Wehrmacht surrounded the town of Banja Luka, and over the ensuing weeks, 80,000 civilians were wounded, 1,700 partisans killed, and 50,000 civilians were sent to concentration camps. In early July, a group of partisan forces was finally able to break the siege, but the human cost had already been paid. To honor this tragic battle, the Kozara Memorial monument was erected in 1972. Designed by Dušan Džamonja, and built atop Mrakovica Mountain on a plateau surrounded by dense forest, the segmented tower stands 33 meters high. To honor the fallen dead, the names of 9921 of the Yugoslav partisans who gave their life for freedom during the World War II offensive are inscribed on a bronze memorial wall near the tower."
62,Partisan Memorial Cemetery,"Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina",This surreal memorial/cemetery is a necropolis of crumbling stonework and puzzle-shaped headstones.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/partisan-memorial-cemetery,"Built to honor the Yugoslav partisans who died during World War II, the Partisan Memorial Cemetery in Mostar is a just as much of a monument in itself as it is an actual cemetery where the dead have been put to rest. But since its creation the strange, graveyard has become a dilapidated dumping ground that looks like an abandoned fantasy kingdom. The sprawling stone memorial was designed by architect Bogdan Bogdanović, known for his politically-inspired abstract concrete sculptures. Finished in 1965, the cemetery holds the remains of 560 members of Yugoslavia’s National Liberation Army who were killed during World War II. The strange boneyard was designed in tiers, not unlike a rice paddy, and the gravestones are shaped like puzzle pieces. All of the burial steps lead up to a grand wall at the back of the site that has a fountain at it’s center that is overlooked by a concrete artwork that looks like gears or maybe suns. Through out the monumental cemetery are paths that lead in between tall concrete canyons that seem like something from a warlock’s labyrinth. Unfortunately, the cemetery had fallen into severe disrepair by the 1990s, with the concrete walls covered in graffiti, and trash littering every nook and cranny of the space. It was also damaged by fighting and war. In 2005 a restoration effort took place that repaired many of the monuments and works, but unfortunately the site soon fell into disrepair once again, with trash and graffiti again taking over the cemetery. Today the graveyard is said to be a landmark, but the neglect shows in the garbage-filled fountain, and crumbling cement. However it is still a haunting place to visit."
63,Sarajevo Spite House,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","Inat Kuća, or ""House of Spite,"" is more than just an oddly named restaurant.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sarajevo-spite-house,"In 1878, Austria-Hungary gained control of Bosnia and Herzegovina via the Treaty of Berlin, and promptly set to work occupying the country and expanding Habsburg influence in the Balkans (which — spoiler alert — was a project that did not end well). Part of their plan involved transforming Sarajevo into a model colony where modern urban planning practices and new technologies could be tested for use throughout the empire. First, however, they’d have to overcome an unexpected obstacle: one stubborn old man. As part of Sarajevo’s makeover, Austro-Hungarian city officials began construction in 1892 on a magnificent new city hall. The building was designed to be a show of great strength and power, as well as an integrated part of the city’s new tram system. Their first task was clearing the land for the structure to be built. After demolishing several houses that would be in the way, though, they ran into a problem. An elderly Bosnian fellow named Benderija refused to agree to the destruction of his house, even after being offered more money than the property was worth. Without the land under his house, there would be no way for the city hall to be built at the desired location, right next to the River Miljacka. Lengthy negotiations ensued between the old man and the city (with even the Austro-Hungarian Minister of Finances getting involved) until finally, in 1895, he agreed to sell his property for the extravagant price of a sackful of gold ducats, but only under one condition: the authorities would have to move his Ottoman-era house, brick by brick, and rebuild it on the other side of the river. Benderija got his way; in the popular account of the story, the old man spent every day of the move sitting in the middle of a nearby bridge, smoking cigarettes and carefully watching the workers transport each brick across the river. When the house was finally rebuilt, it was aptly named Inat Kuća, or the House of Spite. Today, this proud symbol of Bosnian stubbornness serves a more practical purpose: it was converted into a Bosnian restaurant in 1997. The building is across the River Miljacka from the Vijećnica City Hall, which is now a museum. The restaurant serves traditional Bosnian cuisine 11AM-11PM every day of the week."
64,Buzludzha Monument,"Kazanlak, Bulgaria",An abandoned saucer-shaped monument in the Bulgarian mountains.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buzludzha-monument,"On the remote Buzludzha peak in the mountains of Bulgaria stands an unusual abandoned monument. The peak itself was the site of a battle between the Bulgarians and the Turks in 1868. In 1891 a group of socialists lead by Dimitar Blagoev met on the peak to plan for Bulgaria’s socialist future. To celebrate these events, the government in power during the height of Soviet influence decided to erect a monument commemorating socialist communism. Work on the monument began in 1974, and was undertaken by units of the Bulgarian Army assisted by numerous artisans responsible for the large statues and murals. Large images of Lenin and Marx looked over the arena built for state functions and celebrations. Above it all blazed a red star-shaped window in honor of Soviet Russia. After the government’s fall from power in 1989, the site was abandoned and left open to vandalism. The main entrance has been sealed and therefore closed to public. However, there is still a little way to get into the building on the right hand side of the building. Inside the Buzludzha Monument, most of the artwork has been removed or destroyed, but the concrete structure still stands against the elements. A preservation team worked to get the monument listed as one of the seven most endangered heritage sites in Europe, and plans to preserve and restore the monuments are underway. A guard has been put in place 24/7, so it is no longer possible to break inside. Visitors are still encouraged to visit the outside to experience the unique architecture.  Approximately 12 km down a side road from the Shipka Pass. As of January 2018, guards have been placed at the site to deter urban explorers from illegally enter the building. They are on duty 24/7."
65,Devil's Bridge,"Ardino, Bulgaria","An architectural marvel that spans the Arda River, and has stories of a haunted past.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devils-bridge-ardino,"Constructed between 1515 and 1518 in the early 16th century by a builder Dimitar from the nearby village of Nedelino, Dyavolski most, the Devil’s Bridge or also known in Turkish as “Sheytan Kyupriya”, is the most stunning of the humpbacked bridges that cross the Arda River in Bulgaria. It was built over a demolished Roman bridge and cuts from the steep slopes of the Rhodope Moutains along an ancient road linking the Aegean Sea and the Northern Thracian Valley (Gornotrakiiskata Nizina). The bridge is located near the town of Ardino, which even has a water fountain shaped like the bridge. It’s one of several “devil’s bridges” found around Europe. Its span is 185 feet long, 11.5 feet wide, and at its gravity-defying central arch stands 37.7 feet high. Interior semi-circular arches were built in to monitor the water level. The reason some locals are hesitant to cross at night is rooted in dark lore. One story is that the head builder’s wife passed away during construction, so her shadow was encased in the structure. Another tale has it that the devil’s footprint can be found somewhere on the rocks. While this is all folkloric myth, its towering form does make for a somewhat unsettling vista in the darkness. The bridge was declared a cultural monument in 1984. It was also the spot for filming several scenes from the 1988 Bulgarian movie “Time of Violence” (“Vreme Razdelno”)."
66,Belogradchik Rocks,"Belogradchik, Bulgaria",Bizarrely shaped rock formations in northwest Bulgaria come with equally bizarre legends.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/belogradchik-rocks,"Each rock formation bears a name: Adam and Eve, The Schoolgirl, The Bear, The Shepherd boy, The Dervish, The First slabstone, The Camel, The Mushrooms, The Cuckoo, The Red wall, The Madonna, The Horseman, The Monks, The Mental stone, Rebel Velko, The Pine stone and so on, and each one comes with a story. The Belogradchik rocks form a 3 km wide and 30 kilometer long strip, and the rock formations reach some 200 meters in height. They were formed at the bottom of a sea as the product of compression (they began 230 million years ago as sediment at the bottom of a shallow sea) and then erosion over the last 45 million years. The rocks, made largely of limestone, also hold hundreds of caves, including Magura Cave where the bones of prehistoric species like cave bear or cave hyena have been discovered, as have cave paintings dating from 10,000 BC - 600 BC. Among two of the most famous and most curious legends surrounding the rocks are that of the Madonna and the Schoolgirl. In the legend of the Madonna, a beautiful nun falls in love with a man on a white horse, gets pregnant, is cast out by the monks and as she is leaving the nunnery, day turns to night and all, Madonna, monks, man on the white horse are turned to stone forming the rocks. The schoolgirl’s legend is remarkably similar. It also concerns a beautiful girl (who seem to be especially prone to being turned to stone) , replace the nuns with a mean schoolmaster, her love interest is a blacksmith, and this time she is being chased by the schoolmaster and runs into a bear, when—kazam!—as before all are turned to stone."
67,Bulgarian State Monument,"Shumen, Bulgaria",This massive concrete sculpture is said to be the heaviest communist monument on Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/founders-of-the-bulgarian-state-monument,"In the Bulgarian mythology, well before the appearance of human beings, the earth was inhabited by a race of giant named the Ispolini. It is difficult not to invoke these mysterious figureheads while walking the site of the Founders of the Bulgarian State Monument in north-eastern Bulgaria. Since 1981, perched on the heights of the town of Shumen, this huge monument commemorates more than 1300 years of Bulgarian history. Visible from as far as 18 miles away, it looms almost 1,500 ft. above sea level, a gloomy overlord hovering over the city of Shumen. Krum Damyanov and Ivan Slavov built the cubist-style memorial in 1981, commemorating the 1300 anniversary of the Bulgarian Empire. The sculptors of the monument, which is also referred to as The Monument to 1300 Years of Bulgaria, gave kings and heroes the appearance of towering giants of stone, echoes of the past forever frozen in concrete. The menacing figures lurk in high corners of a geometric building with slick, towering walls, the monument reached by climbing a stern concrete staircase. Unlike the Buzludzha Monument and many other Bulgarian monuments from the communist era, the Shumen memorial has been kept up over the years, beautifully maintained and a favorite spot for weddings and photo shoots."
68,The Eyes of God,"Karlukovo, Bulgaria",The ceiling of Prohodna Cave in northern Bulgaria affords a peek at the sky via two deity-sized-eye-shaped holes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-eyes-of-god-karlukovo-bulgaria,"Located in the Iskar Gorge amidst one of Bulgaria’s largest karst regions, Prohodna is one of the best-known caves in a country full of them. This is thanks in large part to the eerily symmetrical holes in the cave’s ceiling, which provide visitors with a rather striking subterranean image. Known as the Eyes of God, these holes are located in the middle chamber of the 262-meter-long cave, illuminating the interior and providing a uniquely framed view of the firmament above. Remarkably in size, similar in shape, and eyeish in appearance, these holes are the result of natural erosive forces. (The possibility of human embellishment has not been ruled out). These slow and steady forces are still at work, as is often demonstrated by the water running down the cave walls from the “crying” eyes above. Prohodna itself has two entrances opposite each other — the “Small Entrance”, which is 35 meters high, and the “Big Entrance”, which is 45 meters high — making it the largest cave passage in Bulgaria (its name, in fact, means “Thoroughfare Cave” or “Passage Cave”). The pools of light permitted by the ceiling holes can sometimes be visible from either entrance, creating the appearance of glowing eyes staring out from the dark depths of the cave. Little surprise, then, that they are known locally as both the Eyes of God and the Eyes of the Devil. These unique formations provided the backdrop for a scene in the 1988 Bulgarian movie Time of Violence. Prohodna shows evidence of prehistoric habitation, though whether it was a domestic or ritual site is unclear. Today, the Big Entrance of Prohodna is a popular location for bungee jumping.  There is a parking lot near the small entrance, and a path from the nearby Peter Tranteev National Speleological Society leads to the big entrance."
69,Rila Monastery,"Rilski manastir, Bulgaria",This historic black and white monastery is one of Bulgaria's architectural jewels.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rila-monastery-2,"Fortress-like, Rila Monastery has gone through many iterations to become the jeweled complex in the mountains that it is today. 1,147 meters (3,763 feet) up in the Rila Mountains, the first and largest monastery in Bulgaria has a history as complex as the region itself. Rila Monastery was founded in honor of the ascetic St. Ivan of Rila (also know as St John of Rila) in the 10th century. He spent the last 20 years of his life praying in relative solitude at a cave some four kilometers away. St. Ivan was revered as a saint during his lifetime. Believers flocked to the remote cave to receive his blessing. Today visitors and pilgrims can still hike from the monastery to visit the saint’s cave — really just a small nook in the mountainside. St. Ivan’s students built the first version of the monastery nearby, and it flourished under the patronage of Bulgarian rulers. However in the 14th century, the Ottoman’s arrival disrupted the peaceful life of the monks. They raided, looted, and destroyed Rila Monastery. In spite of these fallbacks, followers of the church rebuilt it in the late 15th century with help from the Russian Orthodox church and high ranking officials. Even the Sultana, Mara Branković, transferred the remains of St. Ivan of Rila from Sofia to Rila. The monastery prospered again. But in 1833 fire ravished the complex and left only Hreliov’s Tower standing near the Rilska River. Stubbornly, Rila once again emerged from the ashes under the direction of Peter Ivanovich. He envisioned a structure true to the Slavic identity in the face of centuries of Ottoman occupation. Ivanovich built a main church, “Nativity of the Virgin,” in the quadrangle courtyard. Covering it are bright tempera frescoes by Bulgarian masters portraying religious icons, and scenes from heaven and hell. Surrounding Hreliov’s Tower and the church is almost 9,000 square feet of the complex. There is a museum, over 300 monk cells, a library filled with rare manuscripts, and four chapels. The domes, black and white arches, and bright swaths of medieval-style paintings earned it a reputation as a masterpiece of Bulgarian National Revival architecture. Rila Monastery is regarded as a symbol of Bulgaria; it even has a place on their currency. In 1983 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. Rila Monastery continues to draw thousands of visitors despite its remote location. Monks still live there and welcome visitors. Occasionally they can be spotted in their black cloaks and hats walking across the courtyard, sometimes with a cat following. Visitors who want an extended stay on-location can do so in the living quarters and get a small glimpse into the monk life. On the slopes of Rila, the highest Balkan Peninsula Mountain, in the valley of the Rilska River, 29 km east of the Sofia-Thessaloniki Highway. Rila, Kyustendil Province. Easiest to take a shuttle."
70,Historic Melnik,"Melnik, Bulgaria",This tiny Bulgarian town offers a stunning location in the mountains and a storied history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/melnik,"You can see a lot in Melnik (Мелник). Sweeping mountain vistas, quaint city streets and picturesque valleys are all plentiful, as are fantastic markets and great bottles of wine. But the most interesting thing you might come across is this number: 385. That’s the number of residents in this tiny Bulgarian hamlet, and many would say they’re 385 of the luckiest people on Earth. Melnik is the smallest city in Bulgaria by a wide margin – in fact, it’s only able to maintain its status as an incorporated city in somewhat honorary fashion, due to the city’s storied history. In fact, nearly 100 of its barely-more-than-that buildings are designated historic landmarks. Founded more than 1,000 years ago in the 9th century, Melnik has changed hands numerous times as war swept Europe over the centuries, at different times belonging to the Bulgarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Russia, and then Bulgaria once more. The remote city is nestled in the Pirin Mountains, making both travel and residency difficult for citizens. The locals swear by this quiet and reserved isolation however, and visitors are quick to note the quaintness of the town, with its small cafes and old-world atmosphere instantly transporting tourists to something of a land that time forgot. It’s no wonder then, that Melnik has developed a robust and celebrated winemaking tradition, that most ancient of crafts, and one which is perfectly suited for its agrarian surroundings. Of course, that wine is the main cash crop of the sleepy town and brings delight to the locals as well as visitors. Sir Winston Churchill reportedly ordered 500 liters of Bulgaria’s Melnik wine every year leading up to and through World War II. Melnik is also famous for the medieval Rozhen Monastery (Роженски Манастир). The monastery is a ten-minute drive or a pleasant hike from Melnik. There are well-preserved frescoes, stained glass windows, unique carvings, and buildings from the many different historical periods in the life of the monastery. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the many monasteries it founded are still revered, if now little used by either monks or worshippers. That reverence is devotional, of course, for some, but throughout Bulgaria the monasteries remain compelling because of their crucial role in preserving and spreading Bulgarian literacy, culture and identity during five centuries of Ottoman rule. The town is an architectural park and all newly built houses must comply with the Bulgarian Revival architecture. The most visited house is the Kordopulov House, a private museum. Beneath it the ruins of the family church St. Barbara are also worth a stop. Of all once over 70 churches in town, only 3 are still functioning. One of the most important ones is the church St. Antony, the only one dedicated to this saint in Bulgaria. It’s believed that mentally ill patients can cure themselves by spending several nights under the church’s roof. Unlike most Bulgarian orthodox churches, the walls in this one are covered not in biblical scenes, but in more tranquil paintings of flowers and plants. If visiting Melnik on a sunny day and you’re up for a little hike, don’t miss to go all the way up to St. Nicholas plateau. You’ll find the magnificent ruins of several churches, monasteries and Despot Slav’s fortress walls. The views to the magical Melnik Pyramids are breathtaking from there. Melnik is about a 2-1/2 hour drive due south of Sofia. There is a regular afternoon bus from Sofia to Melnik passing through Sandanski. It leaves from the Sofia bus station (just across from the Sofia main train station) and takes about four hours."
71,Monument to the Soviet Army,"Sofia, Bulgaria",A Bulgarian monument to Russia's role in World War II is constantly being painted in pop culture protest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-to-the-soviet-army,"Built in 1954 to honor the Soviet soldiers who died in Bulgarian efforts during World War II, the Monument to the Soviet Army in Sofia has become a popular site for protest and vandalism involving turning its figures into pop culture icons. Although the huge monument is meant to be a stirring salute to Russian military forces who aided Bulgaria during World War II, the statues and their surrounding park have become a popular hangout for young people and counter-culture radicals. In addition to a tall central spire that sees a Russian soldier holding his triumphant weapon above a group of Bulgarian civilians, there are sculptural reliefs nearer to the ground depicting action-packed scenes of charging soldiers. One such life-size relief has been been redecorated again and again in various acts of protest. In 2011 the charging military figures were painted to look like a mish-mash of American pop-culture icons such as Superman, Ronald McDonald, Santa Claus, and Wonder Woman. The slogan, “In Pace With Time” was scrawled beneath the figures. While this initial act may have been more prankish than political it started a trend that continues today. The figures have been covered in pink in honour of the anniversary of the Prague Spring in 1968, covered in balaclavas to look like the group Pussy Riot, and most recently painted the colors of the Ukrainian flag. Each time the statues are vandalized, they are promptly cleaned but not before the crowds of young people are able to spread images of the painting to the world. The continued vandalism of the Monument to the Soviet Army has managed to raise the ire of not only the Bulgarian government, but Russian officials as well. Yet despite the outrage its highly likely that the bronze soldiers will not remain unmarked for very long. Even without the painted figures, the Monument is an unwitting participant to contemporary life that ignores its history and symbolism. Directly opposite, just steps away, is a huge half-pipe ramp where skateboarders and in-line skaters practice tricks, while those waiting their turn lounge or climb on the Monument steps. Various quarter-pipe ramps are positioned in the walkway between the half-pipe ramp and the Monument steps. Small children sit on the same steps having mid-afternoon snacks or practice their climbing skills. Teenagers looking for love, or its equivalent, climb higher up for a bit of (relatively) alone time. The Monument to the Soviet Army is not quite a case of beating swords into plowshares, but it’s pretty darn close.   Any bus or trolley (in Bulgaria that's the street car with the arms connected to electrical lines) that stops at Орлов Мост (Orlov Most/Eagle Bridge). The Bridge divides the main street known as Цар Освободител (Tzar Osvoboditel Boulevard) to the north and Цариградско Шосе (Tzarigradsko Shossay) to the south. The Monument and the large park surrounding it is just north of the bridge on the left."
72,Museum of Socialist Art,"Sofia, Bulgaria",A collection of art from Bulgaria's time as a communist state.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-socialist-art,"The nondescript, office park-looking building which houses the Museum of Socialist Art perfectly fits the subject matter of its collection. The building is drab, utilitarian, and situated in a shabby neighborhood. But these surroundings only add to the atmosphere of the museum, which exhibits art from Bulgaria’s time as a communist state, from 1946 to 1989. The museum’s collection features works of socialist painting, sculpture, and propaganda, many from eminent artists of the day. Subjects include native communist leaders such as Bulgaria’s first communist leader Georgy Dimitrov and its long-ruling dictator Todor Zhivkov, as well as international communist figures like Vladimir Lenin. Of course, smiling Bulgarian peasants and sweating steelworkers laboring for the state also make an appearance. The museum shop has a small theater which shows propaganda movies and television reels, with English subtitles. The museum, which opened in 2011 and is a branch of the Bulgarian National Gallery, is somewhat small, but the exhibits are interesting. Undoubtedly the premier attraction is the collection of communist statuary arranged outside the museum in the front courtyard, culled from former communist buildings, cellars, and warehouses and saved from being melted down or destroyed, the fate that many such works met at the ousting of Zhivkov in 1989. Huge busts of Lenin glare lifelessly ahead and Bulgarian workers clutch rifles in stone-faced silence, ready to meet the evil forces of capitalism. It even has the gigantic red star which used to sit atop the Communist Party House in Sofia, now an administrative building for the Bulgarian National Assembly. The museum is somewhat hidden and hard to find; it is also slightly outside Sofia's city center. The closest metro station is G. M. Dimitrov on the blue line. After exiting walk north along the main road on which the station is situated, bul. Dragan Tsankov, and then take a right onto ul. Lachezar Stanchev. The museum is behind a set of large glass office buildings, which block it from view from the main road."
73,Devil's Throat Cave,"Yagodina, Bulgaria",A spectacular Bulgarian cave resembling a devil's head with a waterfall rushing down its throat.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devil-s-throat-cave,"Said to have inspired the tale of Orpheus descending to Hades to find his lover Eurydice, this exquisite geological wonder is undeniably myth-worthy. Located in the Western Rhodopes of Bulgaria, Devil’s Throat Cave is a popular attraction for tourists, spelunkers, and photographers as a subterranean paradise. Enormous and slightly malevolent, the cave descends straight in the depths of hell, with the waters of the Trigrad River plunging 137 ft. into “The Hall of Thunder”. The second largest cavern in the country, the Hall of Thunder houses a funnel through which the water escapes, flowing 500 more feet before joining itself with an underground river. It is this this underground river that presents the most interesting feature of the cave—nothing carried into the Devil’s Mouth Cave by the river ever surfaces from it on the other side. The curious have experimented with everything from pieces of wood to dyes, attempting to track the items (or colors as they make their way through the cave. Despite the fairly short distance, the fact that water seems to take more than 1 1/2 hours to make the journey form one end to the other supports the likelihood of underground streams beneath the river, a possible entirely different geological fascination. Visiting the cave requires a accompaniment by a tour guide, who will lead you through manmade galleries and staircases that lead up along the waterfall. Along the walls are carvings of men and demons, and leading you up and out of the natural entrance into the impressive flora that surrounds the cave’s diabolical mouth."
74,The Snail House,"Sofia, Bulgaria",A flamboyant five-story building in Bulgaria resembles a crawling snail.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snail-house-sofia,"The Simeonovo neighborhood in the outskirts of Sofia, Bulgaria isn’t known as a hotspot for many tourists. Yet, hidden in the hinterland, there lives a gigantic snail whose flamboyant rainbow coloration will stop passersby in their tracks. Painted in swirls of red, orange, green, blue, and brown, Bulgaria’s Snail House is five stories tall and is said to have “no straight walls, corners, or edges.” Although it may look like a daycare center or a children’s museum, the Snail House is actually a residential area, the location where many eager spouses have begged their less enthusiastic partners to live inside a multicolored slug. The architect of the Snail House, Simeon Simeonov, has built this rainbow snail abode in anything but a conventional manner. Featuring two tentacles atop its head and curved windows on its side, the snail was ingeniously designed to make all of the building’s appliances appear to be part of its decor. The Snail House’s door, for instance, is painted to be the slug’s mouth, requiring residents to be “swallowed alive” before entering. Simeonov also substituted a standard chimney with a big yellow bee on the snail’s back. In addition to conducting smoke, the bee’s horns double as both night lights and lightning arresters. At the Snail House, even the eyes have a purpose. The house’s air and gas ventilate through the eyelids and exit through the snail’s big red eyes. The radiators at the Snail House are disguised as frogs, ladybugs, and pumpkins. Perhaps the most symbolic feature of this giant escargot, however, is its symbolic meaning for preserving the planet. The Snail House is constructed entirely with lightweight and eco-friendly material, making it truly energy efficient. The next time you pass through the Simeonovo neighborhood, be sure to visit the Snail House, a building so bizarre that you’ll have to drive by at a snail’s pace to get a good look at it."
75,Perperikon,"Gorna krepost, Bulgaria",An ancient Thracian city where fire rituals were practiced on the largest cult altar in Southeast Europe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/perperikon,"Of all the ancient cultures, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Thracians are some of the most mysterious. Seen by the Greeks as great warriors – as well as barbarians – the Thracians had no written language, and left behind little in the way of monumental architecture. However, this didn’t mean they weren’t good craftsmen, and the Thracians who ruled an area from the Balkans to Bulgaria and Hungary, were expert metal workers making exquisitely crafted jewelry. In Homer’s Illiad he describes a Thracian chariot as “like no war-gear of men but of immortals.” But despite the fact that they were numerous – Herodotus called them the second most peopled group in the world after the Indians – it is believed they mostly lived in villages and were not city builders. (Herodotus also said “they sell their children and let their wives commerce with whatever men they please.”) Today, archeologists still know little about them, and a recent finding has made even the common held beliefs about them suspect. Perperikon (also Perpericon) is the largest megalithic archeological site in the Balkans, and currently being unearthed by Prof. Nikolai Ovcharov, known as the Bulgarian Indiana Jones. It sits on a high, rocky hill some 15 kilometers to the north of the present-day town of Kardzhali in Bulgaria. While the first traces of civilization at Perperikon go back to 5000 B.C. what is of most interest to archeologists is the more recent (1500 B.C.), and only known example, of a huge Thracian city called “the European Machu Picchu” or the “Stone Pompeii.” Complete with buildings, rooms, streets, squares and a water supply system, it is unlike anything that anyone had ever associated with the “barbaric” Thracians. Of particular interest is a huge altar 6 feet in diameter and hewn straight out of the rock. Here the Tracians would have practiced fire rituals such as dancing on hot coals, and would eventually (500 AD) erect a small church when they were Christianized by the Romans. According to the ancient Thracians, the fire dance was in honor of the creator of the world, which was conceived when a woman materialized (showing herself as the sun during the day and asfire at night) and gave birth to a son. The son and mother slept together to make Orpheus the creator/destroyer of the world. The ancient Thracian cult practice of fire dancing continues to this day in the Bulgaria region, under the name Nestinarstvo, though it is now largely commercialized and performed for tourists sake. Despite having been imbued with Christian symbolism, in rural areas of Bulgaria the fire dance is still done in a manner very similar to the way the ancient Thracians would have practiced it on their cult alter in honor of an incestuous creator mother, 1500 years before Christ was born."
76,Alexander Nevsky Cathedral,"Sofia, Bulgaria",A striking symbol of the Bulgarian capital.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alexander-nevsky-cathedra,"The St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, located at the heart of Bulgaria’s capital city of Sofia, comprises a little bit of everywhere. The marble came from Munich, the metal was sourced Berlin and manufactured in Vienna, and the mosaics journeyed all the way from Venice. Designed in the Neo-Byzantine style, the church can hold 10,000 people and is one of the largest Eastern Orthodox cathedrals in the world. Looking up at the cathedral, you’ll spot countless arches, wintergreen and gilded domes, ornate doors, stone carvings, murals, and mosaics. The majestic structure towers 148 feet at its highest point, and the temple’s bell tower holds 12 bells that weigh a total of 23 tons. The bells can be heard within a nearly 10-mile radius. Inside, you can marvel at the royal thrones and grandiose pulpit, as well as the mosaic mural of Tsar Ferdinand and Queen Eleanor, all within a dazzling and cavernous interior. The cathedral’s construction began in 1882, but was not completed until 1912, and sanctified until 1924. Named for Russian prince Saint Alexander Nevsky (1221– 1263), the church was built to honor those who sacrificed their lives during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, which liberated Bulgaria from the Ottoman Empire. There is also a museum in the basement, within the cathedral crypt, that contains a major collection of Orthodox icons and masterpieces. The nearest subway station is Sofia University."
77,Cape Kaliakra,"Balgarevo, Bulgaria","The site of many battles and tragedies, including the 40 maidens who leapt into the sea.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cape-kaliakra,"Cape Kaliakra, situated on the north Bulgarian Black Sea coast, has long been the focus of local myths and legends. This scenic, grassy peninsula may appear calm today, but in the past it has seen temples and fortresses, bloody battles, massacres and mass suicide, as well as one of the fiercest naval battles the Black Sea has ever known. Long before the 1791 Battle of Cape Kalikra brought an end to the Russo-Turkish War, Kaliakra was settled by a Thracian tribe known as the Tirizi sometime around the 4th century BC. This stretch of coastline would later be successively occupied by the Romans, the Byzantines, the Bulgarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Romania. There are many stories attached to Cape Kaliakra, some of which are remembered better than others. It is said that King Lysimachus – ruler of Thrace, and heir to Alexander the Great – built his capital here on the cliff. He brought back fine treasures won in campaigns against the Persians, and some say that these remain hidden in caves along the headland to this day. Perhaps the saddest story linked to this peninsula, however, is that of 40 maidens who threw themselves from the cliff to die on the rocks 70m below. In the late 14th century Bulgaria was invaded by the Ottoman Empire and countless people were massacred. To avoid being raped by the Turkish soldiers – or sent back to serve in the Sultan’s harem at Constantinople – the girls tied their hair together and jumped from the tip of Cape Kaliakra."
78,Vidin Synagogue,"Vidin, Bulgaria","The second-largest Jewish temple in Bulgaria was deserted after World War II, seized by the communist government and then abandoned again.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-vidin-synagogue,"Despite being in ruins, the synagogue in Vidin, Bulgaria is still famous for being the second-largest Jewish temple in Bulgaria. Built in 1894, it fell into disuse after the majority of the local Jews left Bulgaria during and soon after World WarII. The synagogue was then seized by the communist government, and during the 1970’s, the Ministry of Culture and the National Institute of Monuments developed a plan to restore the building. However, when the communist regime collapsed in 1989, the project was abandoned, leaving the synagogue roofless and exposed to the elements. Restoration efforts have been talked for years, but nothing has been attempted yet, and it still remains an empty shell. Update as of August 2022: The synagogue is now under restoration.  You can travel to the city of Vidin from Sofia by bus (4 hours) or train (5 hours). Many Danube River cruises also stop of in Vidin for a day. The synagogue is located near Baba Vida Fortress, which is on the bank of the Danube River. There is a park along the Danube riverbank, and if you walk through it with the river on your right, you will eventually see the synagogue to your left, right before you reach Baba Vida. It is abandoned and thus open to whoever want to go inside. There is a fence around it and many overgrown plants, but the short part of the fence has a part that is completely cut away, and it is quite easy to find. It is recommended that you only go inside during the day time and wear closed-toed shoes because is broken glass inside. The stairs to the second floor still seem to be structurally sound, so you can climb up there if you want. There will probably be young people hanging out inside the building, so don't be afraid if you hear people inside during the day."
79,Transfiguration Monastery,"Samovodene, Bulgaria","Outstanding, eerie frescoes and decorations fill this 19th-century monastery.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/transfiguration-monastery,"Colorful frescoes fill the interior of this 19th-century monastery. Though their colors are bright and inviting, the subjects they portray are rather dark and foreboding. The first monastery building in this area was established in medieval times and gained autonomy in the 14th century. Over the years, it was attacked many times by Ottoman conquerors until it was completely destroyed and later abandoned. The current monastery was reestablished in 1825. Over the next decades, a new monastery church was built and adorned with gorgeous paintings created by Zahari Zograf. Admire the artwork, and you’ll see intriguing scenes like the Wheel of Life and images of the Devil attacking and torturing sinners. The 19th-century complex has stood strong in this place despite years of difficulties, particularly in the years when the Soviet-minded government did not look favorably on the religion. Natural forces strained the monastery, too. In 1991, a huge boulder fell from the cliff and caused some damage. The rocky ground where the monastery stands has also been strengthened with huge bolts to hopefully prevent the building from falling down after a possible landslide.  The monastery is located about four miles (seven kilometers) north of Veliko Tarnovo. It is best visited with your own transport. The monastery is not opened all the time. A member of the monastery can come and open it to allow you to get a look inside."
80,The Swallow's Nest,"Haspra, Crimea",A castle perched precariously over the Crimean Sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-swallows-nest-haspra-crimea,"Perched on the edge of the Crimean Sea is not perhaps where one would look to find a Neo-Gothic castle. However, the Swallow’s Nest proves the exception to the rule. Constructed on the top of the Aurora cliff overlooking the sea, outside of the town of Gaspra, it stands as a curious remnant of Imperial Russia. The original structure on the property was a small wooden cottage that was constructed at the behest of a Russian General around 1895. However, several years later the cottage was placed in the ownership of A.K. Tobin, a physician at the Imperial Court and doctor to the Tsar. The cottage again changed hands, this time being purchased by Baron von Stiengel who demolished the original cottage and replaced it with the Neo-Gothic manor that still stands to this day. Although it is classified architecturally as a castle, it is not a castle in the truest sense of the word. It was not built to house and protect its occupants, with the turrets and battlements being more for show than any practical application. When one first looks at the Swallow’s Nest it is hard not to marvel at the simple physics of the structure. It is built literally on the edge of the cliff with parts of the balconies and patios actually extending beyond the rock face, jutting into thin air. The whole building looks as though it could at a moment’s notice topple over into the Crimean Sea. This being said, the Swallow’s Nest has survived a large earthquake (6-7 on the Richter scale) that struck the region in 1927. Although the building itself was not badly damaged the underlying rock was. The cliff itself developed a large vertical crack as a result of the quake and the Swallow’s Nest was closed for more than four decades because it was deemed structurally unsafe. In 1968, renovations began on the building in an attempt to make it habitable—or at least visitable. Engineers inserted a large concrete plate into the cliff that helped shore up the crack that was left by the quake. In 1975 an Italian restaurant opened in the castle and has operated on its premises ever since. Because of its inspiring location the castle was used in the exterior shots of multiple Soviet films."
81,Eski-Kermen Cave Town,"Bakhchisaray, Crimea","One of the cave cities of Crimea, built by the Goths in the sixth century.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eskikermen-cave-town,"The cave towns of Crimea are a series of naturally formed limestone caves that were expanded and strengthened for use as dwellings and fortresses during the Middle Ages by various tribal groups. Located in the southwest corner of Crimea, these cave cities are a fascinating example of the local population creatively repurposing what nature supplies into something unique and useful. Eski-Kermen is one of the earliest inhabited of the various cave towns that are scattered throughout the area. Sitting atop one side of a double mesa separated by a 500-foot-wide valley, Eski-Kermen began life as a Byzantine boundary fortress in the 6th century, manned by the Goths. They built extensive fortifications, including a town gate carved right into the bedrock, a siege wall, tunnels, hidden staircases, grain storage pits, and an underground gallery where water was gathered from a natural spring. During this time, Eski-Kermen held a dominant position in the economic life of nearby settlements, serving as a trade hub. At its peak, more than 350 caves were used for habitation, livestock housing, craft workshops, and other storage. Some of them had wooden or tiled flooring or balconies and wooden piping for water. Eski-Kermen was then held by the Khazars from the 8th century up to the 13th century. For reasons unknown, they demolished much of the defensive infrastructure from the 10th century onward. After the Mongols ravaged Crimea in the 14th century, the cave town system collapsed and they were rarely inhabited again. The great thing about visiting here now is you can see it all and walk right through the whole complex. It takes a bit of effort as the paths ascend steeply from the valley floor, but with some sweat and strain, you are soon rewarded with sweeping views of the surrounding mesas, valleys, and canyons. Watch your step and take your time to explore the fascinating archaeological oddity of Eski-Kermen.  Eski-Kermen is located about 9 miles (14km) south of Bakhchisaray in Crimea. Other cave towns in the area include Chufut-Kale, Tepe-Kermen, and Kyz-Kule."
82,Glade of Fairy Tales,"Yalta, Crimea","Over 300 wood sculptures depicting characters from Slavic, Greek and Western folk tales fill this magical garden.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glade-of-fairy-tales,"Located in the Ukrainian resort city of Yalta, the Glade of Fairy Tales is an open air museum full of hand-carved totems inspired by traditional folktales and stories, well living up to its whimsical name. Founded in 1960 by woodcarver and artist Pavel Bezrukov, the Glade of Fairy Tales has grown in popularity to become one of Yalta’s premier attractions. After having been kicked off by Bezrukov, the project continued to grow and now contains works by dozens of different artists. The styles range widely from the brutally totemic depiction of knights to 3D renderings of Disney’s Seven Dwarves. The only connecting element is that they all represent fairy tales or folk tales, most of which are uniquely culturally specific. Other figures in the park include Baba Yaga and her chicken-legged house, the mythical Russian folk hero Svyatogor, Teremok the magical house-in-the-woods, and dozens of other pagan gods and legendary creatures. Throughout the popular park there are over 300 different carvings. Some are brightly painted, while others have been left unvarnished, but all of them seem pretty magical. To Western eyes, many Russian folk tales are seem a bit dark or strange, and even in the Glade, they can still seem a bit foreboding. But placing them in an actual enchanted garden helps to bring out some of the magic."
83,Underwater Museum at Cape Tarkhankut,"Olenivka, Crimea",Submerged busts of communist and socialist figures from the USSR.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/underwater-museum-at-cape-tarkhankut,"Organized more than 15 years ago, this museum boasts a collection of busts of communist leaders and the heads of socialism throughout the history of the USSR — lined up on stone shelves and racks and buried underwater. It’s without an official website of its own and without a lot of documentation, but the underwater museum at Cape Tarkhankut is considered a must-see attraction in Crimea. The organizers of the underwater museum are always open to adding new figures to the collection, which currently has more than 50 different busts. The busts are known as the Alley of Leaders. Known as a romantic and mysterious place, Cape Tarkhankut is at the western end of the Crimean peninsula. Here, a hot and humid steppe fades into the Black Sea and fresh springs erupt from the bottom of the salty waters. It is at this point that the summers are hot and dry, the days warm and windy, and the nights cool an quiet. It is at this point that the sea is crystal clear, drawing in tourists from all over the world. With the sea as clean and clear as it is here, underwater visibility can often exceed 30 feet, making the Alley of Leaders visible even from above the surface of the water."
84,Koyashskoe Salt Lake,"Kerch, Crimea",The saltiest lake in all of Crimea is also the pinkest of the pink and teeming with life.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/koyashskoe-salt-lake,"Lake Koyashskoe is an anomaly in the sense that the drier it gets, the more beautiful it becomes. This is because as the water evaporates and the salt content rises, the microscopic algae and brine shrimp that gives this lake its ever-darkening pink hue flourishes and concentrates. The water level drops, and salt crystals sparkling like diamonds encrust rocks that jut out from the water. Measuring at about 350 grams of salt per liter, Lake Koyashskoe is the most saline body of water in Crimea (a territory which is now occupied by Russia, but is still claimed by Ukraine). Located in the Opukske Nature Reserve, the lake creates a martian landscape on the Kerch Peninsula, and is separated from the Black sea by only a small strip of land. Against the sea’s cerulean waters and white shores, the crustacean pink really pops in contrast. Not nearly as treacherous as the torrid Lake Natron or as deep as the salt-rich Lake Retba, Lake Koyashskoe is small for a majestically pink salt lake. Regularly only about three feet deep, the water stretches across a silt bed about four and a half miles long and a little over a mile wide. The silt below the lake is said to have some serious medicinal properties, and the locals have long collected it as well as farmed salt from the water’s edge. Like its salty associates, it’s uninhabitable for most plants and creatures, with an exception for brine shrimp and the algae that give the water its pink to scarlet glow."
85,Decommissioned Soviet Sub Base,"Sevastopol, Crimea",In the land of the Light Brigade stands a testament to the Cold War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/decommissioned-soviet-sub-base,"Balaclava has occupied a place in military history for centuries. During the Crimean War the Battle of Balaclava, which was fought between British and Russian troops, was immortalized by Tennyson in his poem, The Charge of the Light Brigade. More recently however visitors to the town have been able to experience and tour an old Soviet Submarine base that was constructed during the Cold War. This concrete and steel complex, once a testament to the power of the Soviet Union, now stands derelict having been virtually abandoned since 1993. Designed to withstand the direct impact of a nuclear weapon, the base is covered in a 56meter thick layer of concrete, and includes a warren of tunnels and corridors that at one time housed some of the most advanced and destructive weapons of the Cold War. During this period the entire town was enveloped in a dense cloud of military security with few outsiders permitted to enter the base or the town. Balaclava was cut off from the rest of the world, most of the inhabitants worked on the base and, because of the highly classified nature of their work, were not allowed out of the town. In fact the base could support the entire population of Balaclava (3000 people or so) autonomously for three years in the case of nuclear fall out. Since the base’s decommissioning in the early nineties visitors have been able to tour through the complex and also visit a small museum which sits in a former ammunition depot buried deep within the hillside. Located on the Black Sea Coast, only six miles or so outside of the city of Sevastopol, the base is not only an interesting tourist attraction but also serves as a reminder of the secrecy and militarism that surrounded the Cold War."
86,Ai-Petri Bridges,"Yalta, Crimea",One of the windiest peaks in Crimea is home to an incredible set of cable bridges.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aipetri-bridges,"While Crimea is a bit too contentious for casual tourism, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t wonders to be found among the turmoil. For instance the peak of Ai-Petri where high winds buffet a handful of rickety suspension bridges for a good portion of the year. Ai-Petri, meaning St. Peter in Greek, is a peak in the Crimean Mountains. One of the windiest places in Crimea, the wind blows for 125 days in a year and up to speeds of 100 miles per hour. In addition to the somewhat troublesome winds, the high peak is also one of the foggiest places in the Ukraine, giving the heights an air of mystery and danger. But for all the foggy and blustery conditions on the 4,000 foot elevation, it offers amazing views the surrounding cities of Yalta and Alupka, as well as the Black Sea. But the view of the peak itself is an incredible sight to see. The most well known feature is a tall cross that has been planted in the actual peak, which is a lone stone pillar. Sightseers can reach the via a pair of wood-slate cable bridges that stretch out over the often cloudy void. It certainly does not look to be for the faint of heart. The cable bridges were built in recent years, and allows for safe passage to the cross that was long-ago erected on a rock formation. The top can be reached by a long hike to the top, but most visitors opt for the cable car ride that will take you right there and back for about $4 each way. It offers the added benefit of allowing you to be suspended over a yawning void for even longer."
87,Druzhba,"Yalta, Crimea",This space age health spa looks like a supervillain's lair.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/druzhba,"This space age building overlooking the Black Sea would be the perfect hideout for a villain on vacation. Indeed, when Druzhba was built in 1986, designed by famous Soviet architect Igor Vasilevsky, the structure overlooking the sea was so ominous Turkish spies assumed it was a secret military building. They couldn’t have been more wrong. The building, whose name means “friendship,” is actually a health spa. The strange spaceship design allows for private balconies and amazing views from most of the rooms. On the outside it appears harsh and blocky, but on the inside the circular spa is open, light, and airy. The centre of the building contains social amenities like a salt water pool, a cinema, and cafes. The artistic concept draws heavily from science fiction depictions of futuristic cities, as well as the Soviet architectural tendencies to maximize public space in a space age style. Vasilevsky credited flying saucers and time machines as inspiration for his design. Today the spa remains open and popular as ever, catering mostly to tourists."
88,Tsarsky Kurgan,"Kerch, Crimea",This ancient burial mound is accessed by an impressive Greek-built archway.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tsarsky-kurgan,"The Tsarsky Kurgan or Royal Kurgan is believed to have been constructed as long ago as the 4th century BCE, but the lovely vaulted hallway leading to the burial chamber inside looks like it was made much more recently. A “kurgan” is a type of burial mound where the bulbous pile of dirt and stones is piled atop a burial chamber of some kind. The Tsarsky Kurgan of Crimea is unique among these structures for its entrance hall which is a sharply vaulted limestone corridor that looks almost as though it was created in a much more modern epoch. It was the Greeks who inhabited the area at the time who used their noted building abilities to create the artful entrance. There are a number of kurgans found in what is the modern Ukrainian city of Kerch. Since the Tsarsky Kurgan is said to hold the remains of an ancient king, it stands out above all the rest. The modern researchers of the site found the burial vault empty, likely looted long before they arrived, but it is believed that a king of the ancient Bosporan state was once interred there. Later Christian scrawlings have also been found in the empty burial rooms, suggesting that the mound was used as a hiding place for the early adherents to the religion. Today the hallway of the ancient mound can still be entered through the angular hall. Just look for the mound with the giant cleft in the side."
89,The 'Valley of Death',"Sevastopol, Crimea",This vineyard was the site of the infamous Charge of the Light Brigade.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-valley-of-death-sevastopol-crimea,"There’s a reason this plot of land is referred to as the “Valley of Death.” Though it now looks like no more than a tranquil vineyard, this spot was once the stage for a tragic battle caused by a terrible military blunder. The Charge of the Light Brigade is one of the most storied military actions in British military history. The cavalry’s ill-fated charge was so disastrous, the Russian forces they battled allegedly believed the British soldiers had been drunk. The Light Brigade was supposed to have been sent to prevent Russians from capturing guns from overrun Turkish positions during the Crimean War. But as a result of miscommunications in the chain of command, the troops were instead ordered into a full frontal assault against a well-defended artillery battery, where they faced direct fire from all sides. Surprisingly, the Brigade was not annihilated, though casualties were predictably high. The men fought with just lances and sabres. Their mounts lacked armor. Of the approximately 670 who rode, 278 were killed or injured and 335 horses perished. While the reputation of the British cavalry’s bravery may have been enhanced, the same cannot be said for the commanding officers whose subsequent attempts to blame each other for the disaster descended into farce. The charge itself achieved little, but the fact that there were no recorded objections to a potentially suicidal action has sealed the Light Brigade’s reputation in history. Witnessing the charge in its full glory prompted a French Marshal by the name of Pierre Bosquet to utter the damning statement, “C’est magnifique, mais ce n’est pas la guerre. C’est de la folie” (“It is magnificent but it is not war, it is madness”). The tragedy of the event was immortalized in the 1854 poem, “The Charge of the Light Brigade.”  Visiting the site is not so easy since Russia annexed the Crimea, but it's well worth making the effort if possible. There are plenty of knowledgeable guides in Yalta who can arrange a visit to all the sites connected with the Crimean War (including Sevastopol). The area has many memorials and an excellent museum relating to the Crimean War. From the surrounding hills you can get a good view of the valley which has changed little since 1854. It's possible to visit the valley itself, but it is now a vineyard so care should be taken to keep to the track."
90,Vorontsov Palace,"Alupka, Crimea",This magnificent Crimean estate was once a playground of the Russian elite.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vorontsov-palace,"Built between 1828 and 1848, this magical palace near the town of Alupka has enchanted visitors for almost 200 years. During the early 1800s, the newly-annexed Crimean seaside was the place to summer if you were rich, Russian, and royal. Prince Mikhail Vorontsov (1782-1856), viceroy of New Russia, wanted in on the action and began construction on this impressive summer estate, which cost around nine million silver rubles. A true Anglophile, Vorontsov wanted his palace to remind him of the English architecture he’d grown to love so much during his education in London.  The palace was in part based on designs drawn in the English Renaissance Revival style by the architect Edward Blore, who worked on Buckingham Palace. It was also greatly influenced by the local Tartar architecture of the Crimea. In the end, the completed project was a strange mish-mash of styles and influence- of East meets West. Spectacular gardens surrounded the palace. Sadly, the palace’s reputation is forever blighted by the fact that it was built by serfs who had been imported from Russia. After the prince’s death, the palace changed hands numerous times, and was turned into a museum after the Russian Revolution. During WW2, the Nazis invaded Crimea and gained control of the palace. They had intended to blow it up, but luckily, the Crimean army’s advances forced them to retreat before they were able to carry out their nefarious plot, and the palace was saved. During negotiations at the Yalta Convention, held in the nearby Livadia Palace, Winston Churchill stayed in Vorontsov Palace. He was so impressed by the lion statues that stood proudly at the entrance that he asked Stalin if he could take one home. The request was denied. But Churchill’s memory of the palace lives on: “The setting of our abode was impressive … Behind the villa, half Gothic and half Moorish in style, rose the mountains, covered in snow, culminating in the highest peak in the Crimea. Before us lay the dark expanse of the Black Sea, severe, but still agreeable and warm even at this time of the year. Carved white lions guarded the entrance to the house, and beyond the courtyard lay a fine park with sub-tropical plants and cypresses.” Today, the palace is a spectacular museum and garden.  Open to the public, it is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Crimea."
91,Scythian Neapolis Ruins,"Simferopol, Crimea",The ancient ruins of an extinguished city amidst the bustle of a modern one.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/scythian-neapolis-ruins,"Driven south by the Sarmatian tribes, the Scythians hung their hats on the banks of the Salhyr River near the end of the 3rd century BCE, hoping to enjoy their new empire for centuries to come. They called it Neapolis, and it enjoyed six more centuries before it perished. In a short time the city evolved into an influential trade hub, successful farming and crafts center with a strong Greek influence when it came to culture and architecture. While the settlement was certainly sophisticated in many ways, the Scythians were considered barbarians, assumedly due to their affection for decapitating their enemies and drinking their blood. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times… Despite their connection to Greek culture, there was no love lost between the Scythians and the neighboring Greek settlement of Chersonese, who they constantly battled with. Due to this ongoing spat, the embattled city was surrounded by sturdy defensive walls, though unfortunately they were not sturdy enough, and after a successful attack by the Greeks, Neapolis burned. A tenacious people, the Scythians dug deep into their warrior roots and rebuilt, the stone walls of Neapolis grew higher and stronger. The revival of the city was successful, and the civilization remained viable until somewhere around 3rd century CE. At the end of their reign, they suffered the same ill fate of so many others–being in the path of the military maelstrom that was the Goths and later the Huns, whose aggressive migration steamrolled them out of existence for good. Where Scythian Neapolis once stood, the busy city of Simferopol (home to the longest trolleybus route in the world) currently thrives as the hub of modern day Crimea. Echoes of the ancient people that once were, can be found in the outskirts of town, its sturdy defense walls one of the few remains left standing, but it’s what lies under the dead city that is truly wondrous. During excavation, a sprawling mausoleum was uncovered. In more than 70 dig spots, the mausoleum appeared, and soon its most prominent occupants were unearthed–the final rulers of Neopolis, King Scylurus, accompanied by his queen."
92,Cross Rock,"Cape Fiolent, Crimea",A massive cross stands as the sole resident of this water-locked Crimean crag.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cross-rock,"Staring out to sea from the coast of Cape Fiolent on the Crimean peninsula, the most stunning thing that stands out across the picturesque seascape is a single giant cross, jutting up from a small rock island. Known as Cross Rock or alternately the Rock of the Saint Image, this otherwise unremarkable oceanic feature is a lonely and stunning tribute to local faith. As the story of the rock goes, a ship carrying hundreds of Greek sailors was caught in a storm in 890 that threatened to kill them all, so they began to pray to St. George for help. The kindly saint went ahead and appeared on the rock and told the storm to chill out, which it did. As thanks for pulling them out of harm’s way, the sailors created a monastery on the shore near where they were saved. Over time the monastery fell into disrepair, but the story was not lost. On the 1,000 year anniversary of the sailors’ miraculous rescue and the founding of their church, a restoration effort began that brought the monastery back to life. In addition to returning the monastery to good working condition, a cross was installed on the rock where the saint is said to have appeared. Standing over 20 feet tall and weighing over a ton and a half, the rock cross is hard to miss, and the story is hard to forget. While it is not the largest monumental cross in the world, and the story that inspired it may seem a bit hard to swallow, even by early Christian allegorical standards, Cross Rock makes an unforgettably beautiful sight."
93,Crimean Trolleybus Line,"Simferopol, Crimea","The longest trolleybus route in the world, from Simferopol and Yalta.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crimean-trolleybus-line,"Despite its political troubles, Crimea has always had a place of relaxation and beauty–the Crimean Peninsula along the Black Sea. The seaside resort of Yalta has been a desirable vacation destination on the peninsula for decades. Once only accessible to the Russian aristocracy, and literary celebrities such as Tolstoy and Chekhov, in 1920 Lenin decided that the tired proletarians deserved a little R&R too, and made a decree “On the Use of Crimea for the Medical Treatment of the Working People”. The working people happened to work (for the most part) in the city of Simferopol, which happened to be a good 50-plus miles away from Yalta. Looking over the different transportation options, it was decided that the rock in the area was too soft to support a railway, and buses would be unpleasant and produce too much pollution. So they decided to build an electric trolley route. A 54-mile long trolley route, the longest in the world. Built in 1959, the trolleybus line efficiently weaves through the Crimean mountains, rolling through beautiful vineyards and romantic villas. Ocean views and lovely, varied landscapes fill the two to three hour ride, but if scenery isn’t your thing, the trolleys are also equipped with Russian TV. The trolleybus is said to have transported six billion people since its construction. Some may say that the Czechoslovakia-built trolley is a little rough on the eyes, but many feel it matches the decaying yet colorful resorts that litter the peninsula that was once the private playground of Tzars and luminaries, and now belongs to the people."
94,Blue Cave of Bisevo,"Komiža, Croatia",An ethereal glowing blue ocean cave in Croatia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blue-cave-of-bisevo,"The blue cave of Bisevo is not terribly easy to visit. First, you must get yourself to the Croatian island of Vis, by ferry from the city of Split. Once there, travel by bus or motorbike to the other side of the island, to the tiny fishing town of Komiza. There, hire a boat or tour to take you to the island of Bisevo, about an hour boat ride from Komiza. Then you will approach the cave via a small rubber raft, which is just small enough to enter the tiny cave entrance. The Blue Cave (Modra špilja) is located at the Balun Cove on the eastern side of the island. Though Croatian fisherman have known of the blue cave since ancient times, it wasn’t until 1884 that a (relatively) easy entrance was blasted out with dynamite. Before this small hole in the side of the rock was opened, the only entrance into the cave was to dive underneath the rock wall in just the right spot. The cave is at its most beautiful between 11 am and 12 pm on a sunny day. The bright blue glowing effect is created when the sun’s rays enter through the water and reflect off the limestone floor of the cave. The bright sun lights up the water, and the glowing ocean illuminates the cave walls a brilliant blue, creating an ethereal glowing blue grotto. Though not an easy trek, it is a rewarding one – the blue cave is a truly enchanting natural wonder."
95,Plitvice Lakes,"Plitvička Jezera, Croatia",A chain of 16 wondrous lakes formed as a result of the gradual dissolution of soluble layers of bedrock.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/plitvi-ka-jezera-plitvice-lakes,"Karst is not a particular kind of rock, but rather the landscape that results from the combination of certain types of rock, often limestone or dolomite, and water. The important element is that these types of rock are all soluable in water. Put this type of rock in combination with water and over the years the water works its way through the rock and leads to all sorts of natural wonders. This type of geographical landscape is known as “karst topography” and is the basis of some of the most visually amazing geographical locations in the world. Most of stone foundation of the Balkan peninsula is made of thick deposit of limestone accumulated over eons. Together with the areas abundance of springs, rivers and lush vegetation it has created some spectacular and Eden-like environments. Plitvice lakes in Croatia is a series of 16 mountain lakes formed thanks to one such phenomenon. Travertine is a special kind of limestone which accumulates from calcium carbonate rich surface waters on the surface of living moss, forming growing barriers, and creating a chain of lakes and waterfalls. In an epic race, on a timescale of many thousands of years, the water wears away at the underlying limestone at the same time as the travertine barriers grow at pace of up to 1cm per year, creating an ever morphing, growing, reducing landscape. The whole region of Plitvice is a national park, and the plitvice lakes are one of the main attractions of the inland part of Croatia, situated in Lika region of Croatia, in the midst of the Dinaric Alps. The lakes are divided into the 12 Upper Lakes (Gornja jezera) and the four Lower Lakes (Donja jezera). While the national park is quite safe, don’t wander too far from the paths. The UNESCO recognized park was the site of the first skirmish between Serbia and Croatia during the Balkan wars and landmines were planted throughout. Though it was certified mine-free in 1998, (Croatia has worked extremely hard to demine the country) it is believed there may still be a few errant landmines in some of the more remote areas of the park.  Buses between Zagreb and Zadar or Split will stop at the entrance to the National Park if you ask the driver beforehand."
96,Sea Organ,"Zadar, Croatia",A musical instrument played by the sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sea-organ,"In the Croatian seaside town of Zadar, concealed beneath a set of large white steps leading into the water, is the Zadar Sea Organ. Similar to the Wave Organ in San Francisco, California, and the High Tide Organ in Blackpool, England, the instrument consists of a series of 35 tubes and a large resonating cavity, which is played by the wind and the sea. The organ’s music is eerily reminiscent of the melancholy sound of whale calls. The Sea Organ was designed by architect Nikola Bašić and completed in 2005. Just behind it is another art installation he created — the Sun Salutation — which has an ethereal pattern of glass panels that capture sunlight to power their own light show that is a tribute to the solar system."
97,Zagreb's Museum of Broken Relationships,"Zagreb, Croatia",Where the lovelorn find a home for their sentimental keepsakes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-broken-relationships,"We all have different ways of dealing with the mementos left behind when a love is lost. Unable to let go, some of us hide the barrettes he gave us before he left town to “find himself” in an ornate box under the bed, while others burn photos taken of her before she was caught texting a “friend.” The most mundane items in the world suddenly represent everything that might have been. When Croatian artists Olinka Vistina and Drazen Grubisic separated, their reluctance to part with the sentimental reminders of their fizzled love inspired them to open the Museum of Broken Relationships, so that the items could remain together. At first glance, this concept may seem to contradict healthy healing, but the idea took off, and while the museum was on tour, people from all over began to donate their reminders of heartbreak. Now the museum has a permanent home in Croatia and contains a fascinating collection of former tokens of affection. Besides the anticipated teddy bears and letters, the collection also includes a few poignant and sometimes unsettling surprises – a tiny bottle filled with a woman’s tears, an axe, and taser gun, and perhaps the strangest offering, a prosthetic leg. As melancholy as the subject may seem, the museum is quite popular—be it voyeurism, purification, or just the acknowledgment that the lonely feeling of heart sickness is universal, over 1,000 people per week visit the collection. Due to this location’s intense success, a second Museum of Broken Relationships opened in Los Angeles in 2016. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the Museum of Broken Relationships."
98,Froggyland,"Split, Croatia",A wonderfully strange collection of 500+ stuffed frogs doing people things.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/froggyland,"What would it look like if frogs were carpenters? What about if they went to school, played tennis, or ran a circus? You can find out at the strange, delightful Froggyland museum in Croatia. The collection of anthropomorphic amphibians at Froggyland consists of 507 stuffed frogs arranged in 21 cases. These dioramas were the life’s work of 20th century Hungarian taxidermist Ference Mere, who devoted 10 years to stuffing and meticulously arranging the frogs. When he completed the project in 1920, there were around 1,000 of them. The frogs displayed at Froggyland passed from owner to owner until finally making it to Croatia and getting their own museum. Mere’s project may sound eccentric, but his work is truly remarkable. He used an advanced taxidermy technique in which the frogs were stuffed with cork through the mouth. This time-consuming process left the frogs entirely whole, lacking any external incisions. The varied dioramas - a blacksmith shop, a music lesson, a day on the lake - present everyday life scenarios down to the smallest detail. A photographer holds a tiny camera. A painter has been given a little easel and paintbrush. In the classroom scene, one frog raises two fingers to indicate that it is about to speak. The final result is an absolutely ribbet-ing example of creative taxidermy. (And those who just can’t get enough can hop on over to The Frog Museum afterwards.)"
99,Zeljava Airbase,"Željava, Croatia",Yugoslavia's biggest underground airport lies in ruins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zeljava-airbase,"In the movie Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, the rebels keep their spacecraft hidden in an underground base, to come out only when striking at the Empire. Željava Air Base was Communist Yugoslavia’s version of that base. Situated in the east of Croatia on the border with Bosnia, Objekat 505, as it was officially known, was the largest underground airport in the Balkans. The primary purpose of the Objekat 505 was to house a long-range radar early warning system, akin to NORAD, as well as to provide a strategic command center for the country’s defense. The construction of the base was conducted in utmost secrecy between 1957 and 1965, and the cost of its construction was a whopping six billion dollars, three times more than the combined yearly military budgets of Yugoslavia’s two biggest successor states, Serbia and Croatia. The secret airbase was positioned at the center of a dense sprawling network of military installations, with five auxiliary airfields nearby as well as numerous radar and air defense outposts. The resulting base was a military marvel, an underground airport with four exits, each of which was capable of launching jets.  The base housed two full hunter squadrons. The base was designed to sustain a direct hit by a 20-kiloton nuclear warhead, the equivalent of the Nagasaki bomb, and it could be hermetically sealed. The base could also house up to 1,000 people and stored provisions for up to 30 days. Objekat 505 also had access to an underground water supply and a power generator. Fuel for the generator was brought into the base by deep pipes coming from an underground storage facility near the town of Bihać. The base was intended to protect the country from the foreign aggression. Unfortunately, its designers had not taken into account the possibility of a civil war. On October 25, 1991, on the eve of the war, Rudolf Perešin, one of the fighter pilots stationed in the base, an ethnic Croat who did not want to fight, defected and escaped the base via the fourth exit. He was also not the only one; not too long afterwards, Daniel Borović also defected with his jet, though he managed to land at Zagreb Airport (Perešin had to divert to Klagenfurt in Austria, his jet now on display at Zeltweg Airbase). Even though they did not depart from the base itself, two other pilots - Ivan Selak and Ivica Ivandić - were also based there, but transferred to Užice in Serbia following Željava’s destruction. During its retreat from this region of Croatia, the Yugoslav National Army decided to destroy the functionality of the airbase to avoid its use by any of the factions in the conflict. They did so by setting off built-in explosive charges. A year later, the demolition of the base was completed by the military of the then Republic of Serbian Krajina, and an additional 56 tons of explosive were detonated. The explosion was so powerful that it was felt in all the way in Bihać. Today the abandoned airbase lies on the border of Croatia and the Bosnian Federation, with the line dividing the countries running through the middle of the property. Extreme caution needs to be used when approaching this site, due to the large number of unexploded landmines and other munitions there. The police force of the Bosnian Federation uses the area of the airbase to train its K9 core in explosive retrieval.  Unfortunately, since the migrant crisis, it's difficult to reach this place. In fact, this Airbase is exactly on the border between Croatia and Bosnia, many cops patrols turn around. If they catch somebody, they will have to pay a fine. But it can be possible to send a letter or a mail to the Croatian police saying you are a tourist who wants to visit this place. And normally, you will get the authorization. There is a reasonable amount of pollution with PCB mostly inside the tunnels but also in the soil outside. Additionally, there have been numerous smoke detectors inside the tunnels which were based on Americium-241. It is unknown what happened to them during the destruction. As such, a visit can be a health risk."
100,Podgaric Monument,"Podgarić, Croatia","This stunning, out-of-the-way Croatian monument commemorates a community's uprising against occupying fascist forces.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/podgaric-monument,"The Podgarić Monument was erected in 1967 by Dušan Džamonja as a memorial to the 1941 Srb uprising. A nearby plaque reads “Here are buried 900 soldiers from the wider area of Moslavine who sacrificed their lives for the freedom and independence of our nation during the National Liberation Struggle from 1941 to 1945.” The monument crowns a hill in the small town of Podgarić, where it towers over an artificial lake below. The structure was commissioned by Tito, Yugoslavia’s long-time dictator, who ordered the creation of a number of similar monuments to World War II sites throughout Yugoslavia. Most of the sites were former Yugoslav Partisan memorials, the party with which Tito was involved and who took over after the war. The abstract monuments were meant to symbolize power and triumph, but were poorly maintained after Yugoslavia fragmented. The Podgarić Monument receives occasional upkeep, but it doesn’t get much visitor traffic.  The monument is accessible by car from Zagreb."
101,St. Nicholas Fortress,"Šibenik, Croatia","Large, airy hallways hide within an impenetrable fortress that beckons urban explorers.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-nicholas-fortress,"One of the best-preserved fortresses along the Croatian coast is a treat for urban explorers. Connected to land by only a narrow walkway that just barely rises above the water, its arrow-like shape suggests that this fortress was not one to be messed with. The structure’s seemingly impenetrable exterior hides large, looming brick hallways that beg to be explored. The Venetians built St. Nicholas Fortress in the 16th century to block maritime Turkish attacks and keep any invaders from coming ashore. Constructed from a sturdy blend of brick and stone, its triangular shape and 32 resident cannons made it a truly formidable form of defense. In fact, it looked so foreboding and impenetrable that no one even tried to test it. Its appearance and reputation alone were enough to deter any would-be attackers from tempting their fate. Yet despite its lack of action, the military continued to maintain the fortress for centuries until they eventually abandoned it in 1979. Now, only urban explorers infiltrate the stalwart structure. Most make their way inside via the land, though those with access to a boat can try their hand at squeezing in through the sea-facing entrance. The fortress’s surprisingly airy interior is remarkably well-preserved, making it easy to imagine you, too, are a member of one of the various armies that occupied its walls during its many centuries of use.  The only way to make it to the fortress is via the official boat tour from Sibenik Riva. The fortress is not yet accessible by a footpath from Sv. Nikola beach because the land entrance is under construction. The only entrance is the one from the sea."
102,Abandoned Haludovo Palace Hotel,"Malinska, Croatia",This truly palatial work of Communist-era architecture now sits crumbling on a Croatian beach.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-haludovo-palace-hotel,"Perched on a beach on the Croatian island of Krk is the Haludovo Palace Hotel, which today resembles a crumbling 1970s sci-fi movie set more than a palace. When it opened, the hotel complex was a high-end destination by eastern European standards, considered the most luxurious vacation spot in what was then Yugoslavia. Built in 1971 under the supervision of architect Boris Magaš, the structure exemplifies midcentury space age design, with a certain monolithic quality typical of Communist-influenced architecture. Its modular shapes, asymmetric concrete beams and columns, and wood paneled interior place the hotel firmly in a bygone era. A year after the hotel opened, Penthouse magazine founder Bob Guccione invested $45 million, expanding it to include the Penthouse Adriatic Club Casino. Through glitzy tourist attractions, he reasoned, better relations could develop between the United States and Yugoslavia. The offerings of the hotel and casino, including high-end cuisine, a cocktail bar, pool, saunas, a tennis court, and constantly scheduled entertainment were a far cry from many Western visions of Communist eastern Europe. While Yugoslavia under the “benevolent dictator” Josip Broz Tito may have been a highly restricted and regulated society, foreign tourists were given a pass and allowed to gamble at the casino. Athletes, actors, dignitaries and leaders from all over the world spent time at the Haludovo Palace. However, this golden age didn’t last forever. When war broke out in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, the region became less attractive to foreign tourists hoping to blow money and soak up the sun. By the time Croatia gained its independence, the hotel had been abandoned for years, and was in a state of decay. It remains that way today, a time capsule representing one of the strangest eras (and locales) in the history of tourism. The hotel can be a dangerous place. There's glass all over the floors, the handrails are missing, the stairs are in bad condition. Be cautious while exploring it."
103,Hotel Belvedere,"Dubrovnik, Croatia","The complex has been abandoned since the Croatian War of Independence, barring a stint as a set for 'Game of Thrones.'",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hotel-belvedere,"Just outside Dubrovnik, on a cliff with panoramic views of the city, sits the once-magnificent Hotel Belvedere. The luxury hotel only operated for six years in late 20th century. Ever since, it’s been left to crumble into the sea. When the hotel opened in 1985 it had over 200 rooms, a helipad, and its own private boat dock. The complex has remained abandoned since the Croatian War of Independence. It has, however, had brief stints of occupation. During a siege on the city in 1991, dozens of Croatian refugees took shelter within its derelict walls. The 18 floors of the hotel are filled with shattered glass and the remnants of fallen walls. The outside offers several terraces at varying levels that descend the cliff, each with an unparalleled view over the bay toward Dubrovnik Old Town and Lokrum Island. Its decorated sea-level amphitheater was used as a set for Game of Thrones. It was briefly adorned with the crest of House Baratheon for shooting, but some locals replaced that with a more geographically appropriate symbol: the crest of Hajduk, a local football club from Split, a city about 140 miles down the coast. In 2014, the property was sold at public auction. Russian Billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, known for his impressive private collection of Fabergé eggs, bought the complex for 12 million euros (about $14 million dollars). His plans for the place are slightly more modest than the original, massive design."
104,Ružica Grad,"Duzluk, Croatia",Legend has it fairies gathered at the site of this medieval castle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruzica-grad,"Ružica Grad is the largest castle fortress in Slavonia, Croatia, covering over 86,000 square feet. Since the origin of the medieval structure remains unknown, it has become the stuff of legend over the years. According to the legend of Ružica Grad, this castle used to be the meeting place of fairies, where magic potions were made. Fairies met in peace here until one day, a nobleman decided to build a fortified city right on this spot. The fairies, horrified at this threat to their gathering place, used their magic to ruin the nobleman’s construction plans. Whatever the workers would build during the day, the fairies would destroy overnight. Angered by this, the nobleman decided to erect a net around the construction site. The hair of the most beautiful fairy, Ružica, became entangled in the net, and she was caught. As a warning to all the fairies, the nobleman built Ružica into the foundations of his city. However, the fairy curse did not end there. Just as the trumpets announced the completion of the construction, a stone slid down and killed the nobleman, ending his lineage. Ružica’s name, on the other hand, still lives in the name of the old fortress. And so Ružica Grad still stands on a steep rock, surrounded by the fresh Papuk forest. It is the crown of Papuk mountain, and a witness of untold times.  Take a hike (not long, but intense), from Orahovica lake trough the wood. Then rest and enjoy the medival city/fortress of Ružica grad."

Stopping at the last hairpin bend on your way down to Jablanca will save you some time, there is a trail leading down to the path towards the ship, be cautious though, slippery and loose rocks on the trail. It is a 20-30 min walk to the ship with a nice view of the bay. About 200 meters from the ship is a small ""ticket house"" where you have to pay 20kn for a ticket to get access to the bay and the ship. The area where the ship is located is a national park, hence the fee to enter."
106,Dubrovnik Maskeron,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",Gargoyle head that brings good luck.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dubrovnik-maskeron,"If you enter the Old Town of Dubrovnik by the Pile Gate, as you walk along the Stradun, the main street, look carefully and you might spot a strange gargoyle head protruding from a stone wall. It’s on the left side, just next to the entrance to the Franciscan monastery and the stairway that leads up onto the city’s famous walls. The head stands some half a meter above the ground, sticking out barely 15 centimeters. Its top surface is polished like marble. The wall above it is noticeably greasy from the touch of a thousand hands. Legend has it that if you manage to hop onto the head, keep your balance, and take off your shirt while still standing facing the wall, luck in love will follow you. The gargoyle head was supposed to represent an owl. It was once the end of a pipe that drained rainwater from the top of the building. The maskeron serves its purpose to the present day distributing rain water from the roof to the ground. When it’s raining the the water will be rushing out from its mouth."
107,Brestovac Sanatorium,"Zagreb, Croatia","Once a state-of-the-art tuberculosis treatment spa, these ruins are now ruled by paintball players.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brestovac-sanatorium,"Hidden in the woods of Zagreb, Croatia, the remains of an old tuberculosis hospital have crumbled away into a haunting ruin. From sanatorium to military hospital to paintball arena, the Brestovac Sanatorium has lived a number of lives. First built in 1909, at the time of its creation, the hospital was one of the finest tuberculosis care facilities in all of Europe. Nestled in the calming mountain woods, it gave its patients a beautiful spot in which to relax and recuperate. But it was not just the scenery that led to the creation of the sanatorium. As the story goes it was actually love that led to the founding of the Brestovac facility. As the tale goes, Croatian doctor Milivoj Dezman fell in love with a beautiful theater actress known as Lady Sram. Dezman lived for his lady love, so when she came down with tuberculosis, he convinced the city founders to build a hospital to treat the disease, making sure that it was one of the best to accommodate his lover, who was one of the first patients. Sadly Lady Sram is said to have died in 1913, leaving Dezman to operate the hospital for years after. The sanitarium was used as a military hospital in both of the World Wars, but 1968, the facility had fallen into disrepair, and eventually it was simply abandoned, leaving the main building and a number of other structures to slowly decay into haunting ruins. Today the site is open for any explorers who want to check out the mouldering hospital remains, but they seem to be used pretty frequently by paintballers who are indiscriminate in their targets, so watch your back."
108,Petrova Gora,"Malička, Croatia",This huge metal monument is slowly being stripped to its concrete skeleton.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/petrova-gora,"Built in memory of the Croatian partisan victims of World War II, Petrova Gora stands in remembrance of those who fought bravely against the spread of fascism. However, to enterprising Croat locals all of that is old news and Petrova Gora is simply a convenient source of shiny new building materials. Built in 1981 by Vojin Bakić, the Petrova Gora monument stands 12 stories tall, atop a mountain of the same name. “Petrova  Gora” or “Peter’s Mountain” is also home to a system of underground chambers and tunnels which served as both a secret field hospital during WWII and a printing press for the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The former Yugoslavian countries are full of futuristic brutalist monuments and most of which are under the protection of the Croatian state. However, the Petrova Gora monument has a problem. The site apparently lacks the proper legal documentation and papers, and with no one to protect it the monument has become an easy target for locals looking for free building materials. It has been slowly losing its exterior metal, panel by panel, for years. However, despite the destruction, the monument doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. Underneath all that valuable metal is a huge poured concrete skeleton twisting up the 12 stories like a stretched Guggenheim. It would take quite a bit of effort to destroy the concrete interior, likely more effort than the local government cares to expend, so the monument remains in a permanent state of disassembly. As Croatia has changed, so has the meaning of their monument. This particular monument is no longer seen as a proud reminder of Croatia’s past. Instead the monument’s current rough appearance mirrors a Croatia primarily interested in building its future, even if it means dismantling its past. However more recently, the monument has found one practical new use. It is used as a broadcasting tower for Croatian Television and T-Mobile service. The actual location is accessible via paved roads."
109,Tesla's Birthplace Museum,"Podoštra, Croatia",Humble beginnings for one of the world's most famous scientists.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tesla-s-birthplace-museum,"Like many of the world’s greats, Nikola Tesla lived his early life in modest circumstances: born to Serbian parents in the small city of Smiljan, Croatia. Tesla’s family homestead is simple, even by 19th-century standards. Still, the compound, complete with only a whitewashed house, barn and the Serbian Orthodox Church of which Tesla’s father was minister, stands as a monument to the austerity that produced one of Croatia’s most influential native sons. And Croatia wants the world to remember. On July 10, 2006, on the 150th anniversary of Tesla’s birth and coinciding with Croatia’s state-mandated “Year of Nikola Tesla,” Tesla’s birthplace was opened as a museum. The museum is composed of the two halves of Tesla’s self: his idyllic country upbringing and his science-oriented adult life. Comprised of a multimedia center with hands-on science exhibits, renovated original structures, a playground for future scientists, and – perhaps most fitting – Tesla’s favorite childhood brook outfitted with an experimental display, the museum has become a rather surprising tourist attraction. One of the most noteworthy exhibitions at the multimedia center is a demonstration of rotating magnetic field principles, illustrated with a jumping-and-jittering iron egg. The idea is that two or more magnetic currents interacting with each other alternately take control of the egg and make it spin in seemingly random directions and speeds. From the main highway – Zagreb-Split – near Smiljan, take the Gospic exit. Follow the signs for the museum for approximately the next 5 kilometers into Smiljan."

Those looking to test their own imaginative powers can create and perform the stories in the dress-up room. Hidden doors throughout the museum lead to secret rooms that highlight objects from some of the most treasured tales—Aladdin, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Cinderella—while age-specific texts delight children and adults alike. People are encouraged to open drawers, turn gears, and tinker with other gadgets to bring the information to life. The “magic library” has books stretching over nine feet high, all dedicated to fairy tale writers and folk researchers. The location of this fantasy-filled museum appears to be of no coincidence. It’s situated right near the United Nations Buffer Zone, which highlights a divide that could do with its own fairy tale ending. The museum is close to the Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum and about one minute's walk to Ledra Street."
111,The Zenobia Shipwreck,"Larnaca, Cyprus",The water here is so clear you can see the mysteriously sunken ship from the surface.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-zenobia-shipwreck-larnaca-cyprus,"The Zenobia was a large RO ferry that sank—some say in mysterious circumstances—on its maiden voyage in 1980. The massive wreck has since become a major diving destination, but you don’t have to scuba dive in order to see it. The water is so clear you can see it just from snorkeling at the surface, or even from a glass-bottomed boat. The ship capsized during its voyage from Malmö to Syria. As the ferry neared Greece, it began listing to port; apparently a computer malfunction was causing excess water to be pumped into the ballast tanks. With the problem seemingly under control, the ship then continued to Cyprus. While in Larnaca harbor, however, the listing recurred and the captain was ordered to take the ferry out of the harbor in case it sank and became a hazard to other ships. Anchored offshore, the list increased and the captain ordered the crew off the ship. In the early hours of June 7, 1980, the Zenobia capsized and sank. According to some locals, many of the crew were calmly watching this happen from a harbor-side bar. Part of the mystery of this wreck is that despite the vessel’s own value and the hundreds of millions of dollars of cargo it carried, no investigation was ever carried out, and it is said that the owners never tried to collect the insurance. The ferry was loaded with around 100 trucks, and the vehicles and their cargo are still on board, between 50 and 140 feet below the surface of the sea. Diving and snorkeling can be booked in Larnaca but even if staying in Paphos at the other end of the island dive centers will organize guided trips including transport. Glass-bottomed boat trips are available from Larnaca harbor. Based on two separate dive trips five years apart, the fish life on the wreck appears to be getting better with time, but the numbers of divers on the wreck now makes it seem quite crowded."
112,The Mosaics of Paphos,"Paphos, Cyprus","The ancient mosaics here are considered among the finest in the world, and serve as a stunning record of Greco-Roman daily life.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mosaics-of-paphos-paphos-cyprus,"While visiting Paphos on the southwest coast of Cyprus, history sneaks up on you from all sides, including the floor under your feet. Located in the Kato Paphos region of Cyprus, the ancient floor mosaics are considered amongst the finest in the world, serving as a valuable and beautiful record of everyday life of the Greco-Romans as well as the legends of gods, goddesses, and heroes. Visitors cannot fail to be astounded by the quality of them, particularly the later ones. Floor mosaics were an important component of houses and palaces of the elite in antiquity. Discovered by archaeologists as recently as the 1960s, the mosaics that remain today are from houses of different eras between the second and fourth centuries CE, beginning with the Hellenistic period and extending until the Byzantine era. Though a large number of houses and the mosaics within were destroyed over the centuries, five houses with large sections of mosaics with varying levels of damage can be seen at Paphos. The mansions are named after the recurring theme found in the mosaics inside: the House of Dionysus, the House of Theseus, the House of Aion, the House of Orpheus, and the House of The Four Seasons. Upon entering the House of Dionysus, you are welcomed with a mosaic of Scylla, a mythical sea monster. The craftsmen used the spaces to tell and retell the stories of figures like Hercules, who is the subject of a mosaic in the house of Orpheus. Theseus’s battle with the Minotaur can also be seen in a mosaic excavated from the House of Theseus. The ancient mosaics an important part of the Paphos Archaeological Park, a World Heritage Site. A conservation project was undertaken in the late 1980s and early 1990s, to try and undo the damage caused by centuries of erosion. Shelters were also erected to protect the mosaics as well as provide visitors some respite from the strong Mediterranean sun. If you go here in summer it is essential to take some water. The weather in Cyprus is good for most of the year but if archaeology is your main reason for visiting perhaps avoid the summer when it can become unhealthily hot. In 2008 entry was free on Sunday but this is not currently shown on the website. The entry fee is €4.50 and the site is open daily. The entrance to the Archaeological Park is just a short walk from the harbour."
113,Holy Monastery of St. Nicholas of the Cats,"Akrotiri, Cyprus","For nearly 2,000 years this church has been waging war on local snakes by importing cats.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/holy-monastery-of-saint-nicholas-of-the-cats,"When a plague of snakes almost prevented the building of what is now known as the Holy Monastery of Saint Nicholas of the Cats, the titular felines were shipped in to save the day. Construction originally began on the monastery in 327 on the island of Cyprus under the patronage of Saint Helena. As legend has it, a terrible drought afflicted the island during this time, allowing venomous snakes to proliferate, driving off not only the builders of the monastery, but even island locals. Helena’s solution to the infestation was to fight snakes with cats, and she had 1,000 of the furry killers shipped to the island from Persia and Egypt. Soon the savior had trained the felines to react to two bells: one signaling feeding time, and the other signaling snake hunting time. After battles that reportedly left the cats missing eyes and noses, the snakes were all but eradicated from the island and the monastery was completed. Although the original building was destroyed and rebuilt a number of times over the ensuing centuries, the cats on the island remained, and even flourished into an unofficial sub-breed known as the “Cyprus cat.” When the modern incarnation of the monastery was given over to a group of nuns in 1983, the church grounds themselves had become devoid of cats, and the snakes had returned. Unsurprisingly, the sisters took a page from history and brought in even more outside cats which quickly contained the problem. In addition to the newly imported animals, the Holy Monastery of Saint Nicholas of the Cats began taking in any stray cat brought to them in honor of the felines’ centuries of service."
114,Panagia tu Araka,"Lagoudera, Cyprus",Breathtaking Byzantine paintings cover the inside of this 12th-century church.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/panagia-tu-araka,"At first glance, this 12th-century church looks pretty modest. But step inside, and you’ll enter a space filled with breathtaking Byzantine paintings. Panagia tu Araka is one of Cyprus’ painted churches. It was built in the 12th century as part of a monastery, and its interior is an exceptional example of Byzantine art. Gorgeous, vibrant murals cover the church’s ceiling and walls. Colorful images of Biblical figures stand out against an indigo background. The quality of the centuries-old art is astounding, and it’s all been incredibly well preserved. In fact, the building boasts the most complete set of frescoes from Cyprus’ Middle Byzantine period. Amazingly, the paintings managed to survive even as the building expanded and was renovated over the centuries. It’s believed most of the murals were painted around 1192 by Theodoros Apsevdis, though the two near the altar are thought to be a bit older and painted by someone else. The image of the Virgin Mary that adorns the blind arch above the entrance was painted in the 14th century, and the picture of the saints on the exterior north wall were added in 1673. The exterior of the church is interesting, too. Though the actual church itself is made of stone, a protective timber roof was added sometime in the 14th century. The monastery was in use until the early 19th century. Thankfully, the building wasn’t allowed to fall into disrepair and the beautiful artwork inside has been protected and preserved. In 1985, the church was put on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The easiest way to get there is from Lagoudera village. From there, there are signs for the church. Operating Hours:

115,Larnaca Salt Lake,"Larnaca, Cyprus","Once part of an ancient international harbor, it's now an all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet for flamingos and other water birds.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/larnaca-salt-lake,"The Larnaca Salt Lake has the same ephemeral beauty of a mirage or oasis. Known as Αλυκή Λάρνακας in Greek and Larnaka Tuz Gölü in Turkish, this shimmering, otherworldly lake is actually a complex of wetlands: Alyki, Orphani, Soros, and Spiro, in decreasing order of size. Only the largest, Alyki, is a true salt lake. In total, the wetlands and lake comprise 4,352 acres (1,761 hectares). Though this briny body of water is actually smaller than Limassol Salt Lake—making it the second largest of its kind on Cyprus—it is arguably the most significant. The small Mediterranean island’s summers don’t see much precipitation. Consequently, the lake becomes so dry that in certain areas, all that is left is an exposed layer of caked salt. Come winter, though, heavy rains inundate the island, and the lake fills again. In these waters, ostracods (seed shrimp), Branchinella spinosa (fairy shrimp), and Artemia salina (a species of brine shrimp) propagate and are an essential source of food for the flamingos that use the island as a rest stop during their annual migration. Wild ducks and gulls also frequent the lakes, availing themselves of the salty snacks found therein. In addition to its significance as a biotope, Larnaca Salt Lake and its environs are historically important. Before sediment deposit cordoned off the salt lakes, they formed a lagoon that was connected to the Mediterranean Sea. This lagoon was Cyprus’s largest cove and was used as a port during the second millennium BC. Larnaca, which was known as Kition, was among the most important trading posts in the ancient world—hardly surprising, given its strategic location in waters easily accessible from Africa, Asia, and Europe. There is even evidence that as the two natural channels connecting the lagoon to the sea become increasingly shallow due to aggregating particulate, Bronze Age Cypriots dug a human-made channel so as to keep the port city in operation. Beyond its convenience and accessibility, the harbor was important because of Kitium’s huge salt-exporting business. While this information has given rise to the impression that Larnaca Salt Lake’s saline nature is a result of sea water, this is actually not the case. Water from seasonal rains fills the area, which eventually dissolves a huge underground reserve of salt. Once the water evaporates, the remaining salt to water ratio is increased, resulting in a flat plain of dry salt during the driest months. The lake also features prominently in Christian and Muslim lore. Christians believe that a hungry and thirsty Saint Lazarus asked a wealthy vineyard owner for nourishment, and she lied, saying that her vines were dry. For her coldhearted greed, Lazarus supposedly cursed her land to become a salt lake. For Muslims, the area is important because Hala Sultan Tekke, also known as the mosque of Umm Haram, sits on the edge of the lake. This mosque serves as a shrine to Ubada bint al-Samit, a companion (some say wet nurse and foster mother, though this is disputed) of Mohammed. She is rumored to have died here by falling off a mule during the caliph Muawiyah I’s invasion of Cyprus in 647. Later, the mosque became a residence for Sufi dervishes, who were known for worshipping God through beautiful dancing and chanting.  There are no public bathrooms nearby, so make sure to factor this into your travel plans. It's not a bad idea to bring a bottle of water. Definitely wear sunscreen! There's lot of reflection and no shade."
116,Tombs of the Kings,"Paphos, Cyprus",An ancient necropolis of magnificent tombs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tombs-of-the-kings,"Tombs of the Kings is an ancient necropolis containing numerous large tombs dating from the 4th century BCE to the 3rd century AD. The name is something of a misnomer as no kings are thought to have been buried here. The name, rather, refers to the magnificence of the tombs, which were the burial places of wealthy senior government officials and aristocrats. Many of the tombs are very elaborate with decorated walls and columns carved out of the solid rock. The site is fascinating and very important historically, dubbed a UNESCO World heritage site. A particular type of amphora was commonly buried with the dead and these ceramics always contain a stamp that allows archaeologists to date them and other items found in the same burial.  It is only €2.50 to enter the site. Real bargain. If it is a sunny day make sure you take water. It is just over a mile from Paphos harbour on the road which goes north towards Coral Bay."
117,Kolossi Castle,"Kolossi, Cyprus","This 700-year-old Cyprus castle is the birthplace of the world's oldest wine, said to be toasted by Richard the Lionheart at his wedding.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kolossi-castle,"In 1191, Richard the Lionheart celebrated his conquest of Cyprus by wedding a Spanish princess at Limassol Castle, ordering barrels of wines from the nearby village of Kolossi for the nuptials. The crusading King of England toasted the lavish ceremony with a swig of the sweet nectar and, legend has it, declared the drink “the wine of kings and king of wines.” Commandaria, as the wine was called, still exists today, making it the world’s oldest manufactured wine. The dessert wine derives its name from “La Grande Commanderie,” the military headquarters of the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitallers, two famed knightly orders that occupied Cyprus for hundreds of years during the Crusades from their base at Kolossi Castle, built in 1210. It could be expected that a castle home to such romantic stories of chivalric knights and wine fit for kings would exhibit an equally fantastical appearance. But in fact the image of fairytale European castles arose around the 1500s; Kolossi Castle predates these iconic structures by at least two centuries. Castles were originally built for military strategy, but after gunpowder came into prominence wealthy aristocrats built them as symbols of prestige and fantasy, crafting a starry-eyed view of the life of kings and queens from centuries past. In contrast, Kolossi Castle comes from a time of practical defense. It wasn’t built for style; it was built for war. The stronghold’s tower allowed for an unobstructed view of the countryside and its symmetrical structure provided broader sight-lines for detecting enemy armies. The knightly orders that built it were steadfast in their martial duties, prioritizing military strategy, not architectural beauty. This focus on security and defense was necessary in Cyprus to deter attempted enemy conquests, which it was burdened by for more than a millennium. Its strategic location in the Mediterranean meant that almost every empire sought to control it: the ancient Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Ottomans. Visiting Kolossi Castle today is about more than gazing at architectural beauty; it’s about standing in the footsteps of centuries of history. 14km west of Lemesos on the road towards Pafos (Paphos)"
118,Varosha Beach Resort,"Famagusta, Cyprus","A 1970s resort city now stands abandoned, caught in the middle of a divided island.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/varosha,"In 1974, the Greek military junta backed a coup in Cyprus that sparked a Turkish invasion of the island. The Turkish forces advanced as far as the Atilla line, which is now the United Nations buffer-zone between the Greek and Turkish administrative areas of Cyprus. Located about two miles north of this buffer-zone was the beach resort city of Famagusta. In the early 1970s, Famagusta was one of the most popular beach holiday destinations in the world and was a favorite destination of the rich and famous. It was known for its sunny beaches, glamorous shopping and dining experiences, and excellent luxury hotels. But on July 20, 1974, at the height of the summer tourist season, the impending Turkish invasion suddenly drove all 39,000 inhabitants and hundreds of guests out of the city. Fearing a massacre, they fled and after a short battle, the city was taken by Turkish forces. Turkey remains in de facto possession of the city despite a bill attempting to return it to Greek control. The city is now home to around 40,000 inhabitants. The Varosha quarter, which was the tourism center of the city, has remained abandoned since the Turkish government fenced it off immediately after the conflict. Today, the district stands as a monument to what the world would look like without its human inhabitants. Tables are still set for breakfast, model 1970s cars still sit in their garages, and designer clothing still hangs on the racks of hastily abandoned shops. Nature has begun to take over, and many of the buildings are slowly collapsing, the cars rusting, the pavement cracking and overgrown with weeds. The Varosha Quarter is only accessible to Turkish military forces, the occasional journalist, and UN officials. It is also being used by writers and scientists as an ongoing study of how cities fare after their inhabitants have disappeared. Update as of October 2020: The breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus began to reopen sections of the beachfront at Varosha. It is possible to walk in parts of the city, between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm. There are bikes to rent in the area, as the distance can be quite long, especially during a warm summer day.  2 miles North of border between Turkish and Greek territories"
119,Ancient Sex Curse of Cyprus,"Agios Tychon, Cyprus",Sex curse discovered on ancient tablet in Cyprus.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ancient-sex-curse,"In 2008 archaeologists unexpectedly found a curse inscribed in Greek on a lead tablet from the old city kingdom of Amathus on the southern coast of Cyprus. It was simple and straightforward:“May your penis hurt when you make love.” The inscription dates back to the 7th century AD when Christianity was well established on the island. The tablet also shows a man standing and holding in his right hand something that looks like an hourglass. Pierre Aubuert, the head of Athens Archaeological School in Greece, believes that this curse may have referred to the activity of witchcraft or shamans surviving from the pre-Christian pagan era. However, the true reasoning behind the curse remains unknown, and it seems little follow-up research has been conducted."
120,Foinikas,"Finike, Cyprus",A crumbling ghost town with prime views of the dam that doomed it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/foinikas-ghost-town,"These ruins add a sort of poetic, forlorn beauty to the land. The contrast between the abandoned village and verdant terrain is especially poignant in the spring, when flowers crop up amid the lush greenery that sprouts up around the crumbling stones. People have called this small patch of earth home for centuries. The settlement was supposedly founded by the Knights Templar in the 12th century after the island was invaded by King Richard the Lionheart of England during the Third Crusade. For many years, the village was home to a number of Turkish Cypriots. However, the hostile conditions following the 1974 coup d’état and subsequent Turkish invasion caused them to flee. After they left, the government resettled displaced Greek Cypriots within the village. But, they, too, were eventually forced to vacate. The government decided to build a dam in the nearby river, which would warp the environment and render the settlement prone to floods and unsafe to inhabit. Now, the village is a ghost town. The abandoned structures face prime views of the very dam that damned them into abandonment. Old stone houses and slightly newer, more modern models alike erode and decay. The weathered buildings stand like sad, forgotten memorials to the people who once called the settlement home."
121,Saint Hilarion Castle,"Karaman, Cyprus",The ruins of a fairytale castle with a tumultuous history stand high atop the mountains.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saint-hilarion-castle,"The castle sits near the pass from Nicosia to Kyrenia, just off the main road that now connects the capital with the port city on the north shore of the island. With the high Kyrenia mountains separating the seaside from the central plain, the castle provides an impressive view of the city and the narrow strip of land between the mountains and the Mediterranean. Like many other places in Cyprus, the castle has changed hands frequently. Built by the Byzantines, it was enlarged when the House of Lusignan ruled Cyprus. By the time the Venetians took control of what is now Kyrenia, troops had withdrawn from the castle and parts of it were dismantled. The castle itself sits high atop a mountain range, with three main defensive units at different elevations. One of the castles outer walls is still very well preserved and provides a perimeter to this day. Many areas of the former living quarters and towers at the lower levels showcase the original size of the fortification. Legend has it that a group of hired Bulgarian mercenaries for John of Antioch were thrown from the tower for alleged treason. Today, a friendly cut-out knight congratulates you on reaching the top. The castle remained quiet for years, until the 20th century. In 1974, during the invasion of Cyprus by Turkish troops after a Greek-led Coup d’État, the castle was the site of a battle near the pass between Kyrenia and Nicosia.  Make sure to wear adequate footwear, not all areas of the castle are level and you are occasionally walking on rocks with centuries of wear and tear. While the castle is at a higher altitude, make sure to bring protection against the sun, there are many sections without shade. There is also a small café/shop near the entrance."

Though small and unassuming, it offers a fascinating glimpse into what doctors, nurses, and patients had to work with in the days before modern medicine, from antiquity up to the 20th century. The museum displays a unique collection of treasures including old equipment, curious contraptions, and odd pieces of medical history. Some highlights include stone dildos (“phallic items”) from ancient Kition; illustrated documents containing medial poems and curses; an OBGYN bench reportedly used by over half of Larnaca’s original population; and a replica of the Hippocratic Ladder, a wooden ladder used to treat dislocations of the hip or of the neck. The museum was founded in 2011 by Marios Kyriazis, a private collector who inherited many of these artifacts from his grandfather and great-grandfather. Aside from the museum’s permanent exhibition, it also hosts cultural events, public lectures, and all sorts of activities revolving around medical interests. The museum also has a lovely outdoor garden where healing herbs such as lavender, basil, sage and melissa are planted and health drinks are served. It is located at the intersection of Karaolis and Dimitriou Street. It is open on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 9 AM to 12.30. Entrance is free."
123,Cyprus Buffer Zone,"Nicosia, Cyprus",This no man's land slicing through the island is strewn with abandoned relics of another time.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/un-buffer-zone-cyprus-green-line,"A Buffer Zone controlled by the United Nations cuts across the island of Cyprus, dividing the country’s population in two, with ethnic Greek Cypriots in the south and ethnic Turkish Cypriots in the north. Also called “the Green Line,” this demilitarized zone was established in its current form in 1974, following the ceasefire after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Although this Buffer Zone runs all the way through the country, the section dividing the capital city of Nicosia is the most palpable, as all roads running on a north-south axis come to a dead end. At times, they terminate with a passport checkpoint. Others end with fortified guard huts. And rarely, but surely, some sections are badly fenced and unguarded, tempting short, forbidden visits within the UN-patrolled no man’s land. The Green Line stretches some 112 miles across the island. In some parts, the zone is no more than several feet wide. Other sections have been normalized, and are even home to thousands of Cypriots living within the zone and farming the land. One village inside the Buffer Zone, called Pyla, is the only place in the country where Greek and Turkish Cypriots live side-by-side. In the areas where the demilitarized line cuts through the capital, the zone is strewn with abandoned buildings, gardens, vehicles, and even the decaying Nicosia International Airport. These crumbling relics have sat neglected for over 40 years, and now serve as a chilling time capsule of a former life in Cyprus.  The Buffer Zone is off-limits to the public, but the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) may permit visits on a case-by-case basis to researchers, photographers, and others. More information and the Visit Request Form can be found at the UNFICYP website. The map coordinates above point to a part of the Green Line in the heart of Nicosia's old town, near the custom's office on the southern edge of the Buffer Zone."
124,The Donkeys of Dipkarpaz National Park,"Dipkarpaz, Cyprus",The animals wander freely amid this gorgeous stretch of nature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-donkeys-of-dipkarpaz-national-park,"If Cyprus is imagined as a hand with an elongated index finger pointing northeast, Dipkarpaz National Park would be the tip of the finger. In this part of the island, black donkeys wander around freely and tease tourists. The donkeys are there because of the island’s complicated late 20th-century history. In 1974, tension between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots escalated. A Greek Cypriot military coup followed by attacks on the Turkish Cypriot community caused the Turkish army to enter the island. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus then formed. The crossing point between the two states only opened in 2004. When the Greek Cypriots left the northeast part of the country, they left everything behind—including their donkeys. These donkeys started roaming around freely and, of course, reproducing. Today, you can still find them in the protected area on the most northern part of the island. Entering Dipkarpaz National Park requires passing through Karpasia National Park first. A curling road that slowly rises allows people to enter Dipkarpaz, where black donkeys usually wait near the entrance. When you reach the top of the road, glance down and you’ll see travelers on the long beautiful Golden Beach. Once you’re in the park, you’ll also have access to the Apostolos Andreas Monastery. This place’s destiny changed when St. Andrew’s ship allegedly crashed into rocks and the captain’s blind eye was healed after he came ashore. You’ll find people making wishes by lighting long, thin candles. Not surprisingly, donkeys walk around in the church garden waiting to be fed.  The best way to go to this untouched part of Cyprus is to rent a car. There are no big hotels due to preservation rules, so you can stay in bungalows or trailers."

The entire island of Cyprus is split by a jagged horizontal line, with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the top and the Republic of Cyprus on the bottom. The division is an official United Nations Buffer Zone, and it was closed to the civilian population until 2003. Today, Cypriots and tourists alike can move between the north and south of Cyprus via a handful of designated checkpoints. Phaneromenis 70 is a five-minute walk from the Lidras Street checkpoint in the Greek Cypriot half of Nicosia. It’s easy to overlook this shop due to its understated sign and location amid many bustling cafes. However, once you step inside you will find a hidden abundance of creativity. This shop, founded by Cypriot artist Kyriaki Costa, showcases goods from local artists who work in ceramics, jewelry, printmaking, drawing, painting, and textiles. Most of the artwork displays a unique combination of ancient archaeology (think traditional Roman sculptures and Greek terra-cotta vases) with a smirkingly modern twist. Additionally, Phaneromenis 70 publishes Delivering Views, a serial cultural publication that shows Nicosia through the eyes of foreign visitors. There have been 24 chapters of Delivering Views thus far, and each one features a different visitor, along with his or her unique take on Cypriot culture expressed in the mediums of photography and writing.

As king of much of eastern Europe and eventually Holy Roman Emperor during the 16th century, Rudolf II was not known as an especially effective ruler, but he is widely remembered for his interest and patronage of the occult arts. It was during his reign that he turned Prague into the unofficial capital of the dark arts. Funding a number of alchemists and other so-called sorcerers, most notably the likes of Edward Kelley and John Dee, Rudolf created possibly the most active period of occult practice in history. Whether or not his patrons were simply charlatans wrapped in mystery (which they probably were), or bold proto-scientists, the legacy of these magicians and madmen is remembered with a carnival flair at The Museum of Alchemists and Magicians of Old Prague. Consisting of two levels of displays and tableaux, the exhibits trace the history of Rudolf’s alchemists in the city, especially Kelley. The main floor has displays and replica artifacts of the trade alongside such fantastical scenes as a failed magician being stolen up into the ceiling by the Devil while cackling sorcerers huddle around the glowing runes beneath. The second floor, which claims to be the actual tower where the real Kelley performed his esoteric experiments, is decked out like an alchemist’s lab, all aged scrolls and stacked grimoires, complete with a half-completed homunculus, the ultimate alchemical achievement. The museum is more than a little sensational in its presentation, but to be fair, these alchemists were likely more than a little bit showmen themselves. What better way to remember and learn about their arcane history than with a little bit of magical realism?Please note that the museum will close if they have a school tour, so call ahead."
127,Strahov Monastery,"Prague, Czechia",Two stunning 17th-century libraries and a cabinet of curiosities.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/strahov-monastery-me,"Tucked away on the top of a hill in Prague is the Strahov Monastery, the second-oldest monestary in the city. It was built in 1140 and has been rebuilt numerous times since, due to the ravages of various wars. It is likely not the monastery itself, nor its church, however, that astonishes visitors. That distinction goes to the the library within its walls. The library is divided into two major halls: the Baroque Theological Hall contains 18,000 religious texts, and the grand Philosophical Hall has over 42,000 ancient philosophical texts. The libraries hold many rare volumes, are masterfully frescoed, and contain 17th-century geographical globes. Above the shelves of the Theological Hall are gilded wooded-carved decorations with wooden cartouches. These functioned as a sort of beautiful early card catalogue system. The pictures in the wooden cartouches and their titles specified the type of literature stored on the shelves below. Of special note is the compilation wheel, used by 17th-century scribes to compile texts. The scribe would place various texts that he needed to copy from on the wheel, which functioned as a kind of rotating shelf. A planetary mechanism inside ensured that the books were always held at the same angle, even as they spun around. Strahov also contains a beautiful cabinet of curiosities, brought to the monastery from the estate of Karel Jan Erben in 1798.

128,Idiom Installation,"Prague, Czechia",A Jenga-style cylindrical tower of books that appears to go on forever.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/idiom-installation,"For bibliophiles, an infinite tower of books is a nightmare disguised as a dream—a huge collection of literature that you can’t get at because pulling a book or two out will cause the collapse of the tower. But it does make for a wonderful sight. A real-life iteration of this dream-nightmare is on display at the Prague Municipal Library. Artist Matej Kren’s “Idiom” is a long-term art installation where hundreds of books are stacked in a cylindrical tower. Mirrors placed at the bottom and the top give the exhibit the illusion of being infinite. A tear-shaped opening on one side of the tower allows visitors to peek in and experience what it would be like to drown in a book well. Idiom was originally displayed at the Sao Paulo International Biennial in 1995, and found a permanent home in the entrance hall of the Czech library in 1998. This literary wormhole has become a local landmark in its own right, even featured on the cover of Science magazine in 2011. Kren, who was born in Trencin, Slovakia, explores the theme of infinite knowledge offered by books in many of his works. “Gravity Mixer” is another book-themed installation, where Kren created a rotunda of books, and “Passage” in Bratislava is an endless looming wall of literature."
129,Prague Astronomical Clock,"Prague, Czechia",Macabre astrological automaton clock dating to the late 1400s.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prague-astronomical-clock,"The legend of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town of Prague seems to have come straight from the Brothers Grimm. The dark tale is set in the fifteenth century, when the clock is said to have been created by the great clockmaker Mikuláš from Kadaň. Such was the reputation of his craftsmanship that Mikuláš was approached by many a foreign nation, each wishing to have its own town square topped with a marvelous astronomical clock. Mikuláš refused to show the plans of his masterpiece to anyone, but word got back to the Prague Councilors. Overcome with fear that Mikuláš might build a bigger, better, and more beautiful clock for another nation, the Councilors had the brilliant clockmaker blinded, ensuring that their clock would never be topped. Driven mad, the clockmaker took the ultimate revenge, throwing himself into his extraordinary work of art, gumming up the clock’s gears and ending his own life in one stroke. In doing so, he cursed the clock. All who tried to fix it would either go insane, or die. While this is only a legend, it stands as a testament to the extraordinary nature of the Prague Astronomical Clock. The clock has been modified, destroyed, and repaired many times since its creation in 1380. It is perhaps the most well-known astronomical clock in the world, with four moving automatons (including a skeleton ringing his death knell for each hour), and rotating statues of the 12 apostles. It displays Babylonian time, Old Bohemian time, German time, and Sidereal time. It also shows the moon’s phases and the sun’s journey through the constellations of the zodiac. The calendar dial, just below the clock, shows the day of the month, the day of the week, feast days and allegorical pictures of the current month and sign of the zodiac. Though the legend of Mikuláš is apocryphal, Prague is not without a dark history - the cobblestones of the Old Town Square below the clock are marked with 27 crosses commemorating 27 beheaded Czech noblemen. Be sure to go upstairs for a tour of the interior of the fascinating clock. In Czechia, the Prague Astronomical Clock is known simply as the Orloj, from the Latin word horologium. As the saying goes, imitation is the highest form of flattery. When it was created, the Prague Astronomical Clock was an outstanding technological achievement. In modern times, Koreans fascinated by the Orloj built a working replica of the clock and the tower of the Old Town Hall. Their building in Seoul is called Castle Praha Hongdae. Update January 2019: After nine months of restoration—the most extensive since the 1940s—the clock has been returned to its former glory and is back on view.  There are free walking tours available to the area, also check out the main visitors and climb the main tower for amazing views of the square and city."
130,"Sedlec Ossuary ""Bone Church""","Kutna Hora, Czechia","A church of bones, decorated with 40,000 human skeletons.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sedlec-ossuary,"The 40,000 to 70,000 skeletons within Sedlec Ossuary (aka Kostnice Ossuary Beinhaus) in the Czech Republic welcome you, quite literally, with open arms. Known to most as “the Bone Church,” it displays some of the world’s more macabre art. In addition to a splendid bone chandelier composed of almost every bone in a human body, the ossuary displays two large bone chalices, four baroque bone candelabras, six enormous bone pyramids, two bone monstrances (a vessel used to display the Eucharistic host), a family crest in (you guessed it) bone, and skull candle holders. Festively looping chains of bone are hung throughout like crepe paper at a birthday party. Sedlec Ossuary has a long history, beginning in the 13th century when the Abbot of the Sedlec Monastery (Abbot Henry) brought a handful of earth back from a journey to the Grave of the Lord in Jerusalem. He scattered this “holy soil” across the Sedlec cemetery, securing its place as one of the most desired burial sites for people all over Bohemia and the surrounding countries. Everyone wanted to be buried in that handful of the Holy Land and more than 30,000 were. But it wasn’t long before there simply wasn’t enough room for everyone to rest in peace, and the bodies were moved to a crypt to make room for the newly dead. In 1870, a local woodcarver, František Rint was employed for the dark task of artistically arranging the thousands of bones. Rint came up with the Bone Church’s stunning chandelier, as well as the amazing Schwarzenberg coat of arms, which includes a raven pecking at the severed head of a Turk–all made of human bone. Rint was responsible for bleaching all of the bones in the ossuary in order to give the room a uniform look. His artist’s signature is still on the wall today–naturally, in his medium of choice, bone.  One hour train ride from Prague. It's much easier to take the train than the bus, as you can walk from the train station in Kutná Hora in about ten minutes. Kutna Hora is a small and quiet town. You are free to walk around this skull church and admire the work of building up those skulls."
131,Dripstone Wall,"Prague, Czechia",Countless grotesque faces stare out from this eerie Prague art wall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dripstone-wall-2,"Resting at the heart of Prague’s baroque palace grounds is a famously eerie wall, surrounded by lush gardens. Constructed at the behest of Albrecht von Wallenstein between 1623 and 1630, the Wallenstein Palace enjoyed a centuries-long first life as a magnificent private residence for various generations of the Wallenstein family. At the close of World War II, the land fell into the hands of the state government, who repurposed the palace’s main buildings to serve as the seat of operation for the Senate of Czechia. Despite the elite negotiations that have always taken place inside the palace’s handsome corridors, it is the Wallenstein Palace’s massive network of complex, geometric gardens that remain the biggest draw for the public since 2002. Fashioned in an early baroque style, the grounds were partitioned into several distinct areas, the most secluded and fascinating of which was known as “The Grotto.” In this portion of the garden, aspects of real and artificial elements of nature co-mingle, creating an eerily unreal landscape. Here, grotesques were allowed to reign supreme, including imagery of snakes, monsters, and random, distorted faces, while an aviary provided a crucial acoustic element. Contemporary visitors to the Grotto remain most struck by the Dripstone Wall, created by things that, from a distance, seem to be dripping skulls. Closer investigation reveals the wall is made from a haunting, uncanny assemblage of stalactite-like rocks. Signs along the wall note that, if one stares hard enough, it’s possible to make out human and animal faces peering out from within the wall’s recesses. Adding further fuel to the site’s disconcerting nature are other strategically placed clues that the Dripstone Wall itself could, perhaps, contain secret passageways wending through its interior, accessible only by those bright enough to discern the pattern of access. Throughout nearly 500 years of years of existence, no one seems to have found a way in, but, thankfully, that hasn’t yet stopped visitors from dreaming about solving the mystery.  The Dripstone Wall park is only open between April and October."
132,Speculum Alchemiae,"Prague, Czechia",The hidden lair of an alchemist rediscovered in a 2002 flood.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/speculum-alchemiae,"Hidden in the historical center of Prague you will find a ground floor studio sporting portraits, books, and assorted curiosities. The hide of the last black bear to be hunted in the outskirts of Prague lies on the floor. The real treasure is yet to come. Locate the small statue in the library and give it a twist. A secret door will open down onto a narrow set of stairs, which leads to an underground laboratory sprawling beneath. This underground space, re-discovered after the massive flood of 2002, contains the equipment and the crucible used (supposedly) to turn lead into gold. A mummified crocodile hangs from the ceiling: the alchemists used to refer to it as a “dragon” to inspire awe in their visitors. While the museum is a re-creation, a bit gimmicky, and the trip through the secret door down into the basement is done with a tour guide it is nonetheless an unusual journey into Prague’s occult history. This was the place where experiments were conducted, hidden from the eyes of the inquisition: for good measure, a tunnel (the beginning of which is shown during the guided visit) led directly from the laboratory to a safe escape in the woods out of the city… alchemists can never be too careful."
133,Olšany Cemetery,"Prague, Czechia",Walk through Czech history in Prague's largest graveyard.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/olsany-cemetery,"For a cemetery created in the hectic panic of a plague epidemic, Prague’s sprawling Olšany Cemetery is a beautifully planned public work. In the 17th century it was considered unhygienic to bury the corpses of plague victims within city limits, so a large cemetery was designated in 1680 for this very purpose. When plague struck again a century later, Emperor Joseph II enacted a series of hygiene reforms and Olšany became the city’s official cemetery. It was continually used up until the 20th century, when a number of elaborate art nouveau grave monuments made the cemetery a place for sightseers, not just mourners. Olšany Cemetery is the largest in Prague and one of the largest in Czechia. This is because it is comprised of 12 different sections. The New Jewish Cemetery was created to replace the Old Jewish Cemetery,  and included a small Orthodox section. An even smaller Muslim section sits on the opposite side of the graveyard. It is said that over 2 million people are buried here in over 60,000 grave sites.  A “Learning Trail” provides a historical walk through the graves. Visitors can walk from the 17th century graves at the north end of the cemetery to the filigreed mausoleums of the 20th century near the center. The crisply groomed military cemetery marks a stark contrast to the leaning, ivy-covered graves of earlier centuries. Soldiers from a range of conflicts are interred here, from the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century to World War II. Many Czech soldiers who died fighting for their country’s independence are buried here, and so are members of the Soviet Red Army who died fighting in Czechoslovakia. As per an agreement between Czechia and Russia, each maintains the graves of their former who died on their soil. Picturesque setting aside, people come to Olšany to pay their respects to their deceased loved ones as well as some famous figures in Czech history. A number of actors, writers, and painters are buried here, as are Jan Palach, a student who immolated himself in protest of the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and Pavel Roman, one of the first celebrity ice skaters.  Cemetery hours are 8 a.m.-7 p.m. May-September, to 6 p.m. during March, April, & October, and to 5 p.m. November-February."
134,Cross Club,"Prague, Czechia","A steampunk-styled three-floor factory churning out art, activism, and electronic beats.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cross-club,"The Cross Club, which is styled like a futuristic industrial pirate’s cove covered in twisting gears, lives up to its name, providing a space where people and art styles of all kinds can cross paths. The club was founded by František Sádra Chmelík and a small group of friends in 2002. At the time, it was a low-key private space for DJs and other Czech creatives to practice. Word spread quickly though, and the owners were able to raise over half a million Czech koruna via crowdfunding to expand the club. Over the course of a few years, the little rehearsal space grew into a three-floor factory churning out art, activism, and education, in addition to bangin’ electronic concerts. Most of the DJs who began Cross Club were dubstep, EDM, and/or breakbeat focused, but the club’s musical repertoire has expanded to include punk, ska, rockabilly, reggae, and myriad other styles. In addition to the musical offerings, Cross Club has a number of family friendly programs during the day. Children’s theater and puppet shows happen in the afternoon. The club’s “Ghettollege” program presents educational lectures on everything from Islamic theology to software programming. These are usually free of charge and open to the public. Other events include poetry readings, film screenings, and costume contests. There is also, of course, a bar and café in case you work up an appetite while dancing, learning, and exploring."
135,Old Jewish Cemetery,"Prague, Czechia","Around 100,000 bodies are buried below the medieval headstones, many of which mark graves with multiple bodies stacked up to 12 deep.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-jewish-cemetery-1,"The 12,000 headstones in the Old Jewish Cemetery are crumbling and covered with ivy, toppled and clustered together. This was not Prague’s first Jewish cemetery, but it is the oldest surviving in the city. The oldest burial date listed is 1439, though the cemetery was probably in use long before that, and the most recent burial was in 1787. Burials ceased when a new decree prohibited interment in areas where people lived because of health risks. The notoriously dirty neighborhood of Josefov, where the Jewish cemetery is located, underwent serious cleanup and reconstruction efforts. Part of the cemetery was displaced for a new road, which meant the dead and their headstones were exhumed and stuffed into empty spaces in the already crowded plots. There are upwards of 12,000 headstones in the cemetery, though it is speculated that as many as 100,000 individuals are buried beneath them, stacked 12 deep in some places. Jewish customs forbid the removal of old graves, so the dead were simply piled on top of one another for centuries. New dirt was even trucked in to create more earth for burials. As Prague was a hub of Jewish scholasticism in Eastern Europe, it’s no surprise that some of the foremost figures in Jewish history are buried here. Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel, a central character in the myth of the golem, is buried beneath an ornate sand-colored headstone decorated with a lion. The astronomer David Gans has the Star of David and a goose on his. These symbols appear on the headstones of common graves as well. Along with the Hebrew script denoting the person buried below, the images engraved on the stones could communicate names (“Gans” means goose in German), professions (books for cantors; scissors for tailors), and characteristic traits (grapes for a full, prosperous life; the Star of David for devout Jews). During the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, historic synagogues and other sites were destroyed, effectively erasing the physical traces of Jewish culture. However, the Old Jewish Cemetery and the thousands of artifacts collected by the Jewish Museum escaped this fate through dark but fortunate providence. It is believed that the Nazis wished to save these items for a “Museum of an Extinct Race” in Prague, which would inform people of the future about the Jewish race wiped out by the Aryans. Thankfully this museum and its subject did not come to fruition, and the cemetery, along with the artifacts of the Jewish Museum, were spared. Today, visitors can pay their respects to the thousands buried at the Old Jewish Cemetery through tours offered by Prague’s Jewish Museum. Hundreds of pebbles and prayers written on tiny papers can be found resting atop the gravestones. The attached museum has poems and pictures drawn by children during the Nazi occupation, as well as toys.    Keep in mind when you visit the Jewish Quarter and all Jewish museums and sights that these are closed on Saturdays (Sabbath) and Jewish holidays. Also keep in mind that there are often queues to view the cemetery (sometimes up to an hour or more). Tip: If you are in Prague for a few days and you plan to visit various tourist sites, purchase a Prague card. This is valid for different number of days and gives you free entry or reduction on the entry price. The cemetery can only be seen as a part of the tour and cost around €20."
136,Sex Machines Museum,"Prague, Czechia",The first museum in the world devoted to sexual gadgetry.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sex-machines-museum,"Near the Old Town Square, if one is “into” such a thing, there lies a museum full of sexy devices and contraptions all designed to make sexual pleasure a little more mechanical. Perhaps that description makes the objects displayed in this erotic collection sound a little impersonal, but no worries—if a contraption in the collection is hard to wrap your brain around, the museum has been kind enough to wrap a flexible dummy around it to further demonstrate its use. Opening its doors in 2002 it is, to date, the only museum in the world dedicated to sex machines and sex machines exclusively. The museum has hundreds of sexytime contraptions, spread out over three floors of space. Alongside the copulation tables, iron corsets and assorted stimulation doodads, you will find a smattering of sex-related artifacts, some dating back as far as the early 16th century. There are also shoes worn by ancient Greek prostitutes, human sexuality photos, an unsettlingly large erotic apparatus from a German women’s prison created to placate “fervent feelings” of the inmates, and some of the earliest pornos ever filmed. The museum was popular from the get-go, but city officials found it “disagreeable.” Unsurprisingly, this made it all the more appealing, especially among tourists from more sexually-repressed locations.   The museum is open everyday between 10am to 7pm."
137,Brown-Nosers,"Prague, Czechia",The risqué mixed-media sculptures are supposedly a metaphor for Czech politics.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brownnosers,"David Černý has a number of controversial, provocative sculptures scattered throughout Prague and the wider world. Of all of these, Brown-nosers is perhaps among his most not-safe-for-work exhibits. The sculptures are a permanent fixture hidden in the back garden of Futura, an art museum. The gigantic, naked lower halves of two bodies are bent over and lean against the side of the building, revealing their rather gaping orifices. Though their somewhat obscene appearance doesn’t make the figures look too inviting, Brown-nosers is actually an interactive, mixed-media exhibit. Viewers are invited to climb the ladder leading to the macroscopic derrieres and stick their heads inside the behemoth butts. But rather than being greeted with a slurry of some sort of sculpted internal sludge, as one might expect to find within an artistic anus, people will instead see a television screen that plays a video of two Czech politicians spoon feeding each other to the sounds of Queen’s “We Are the Champions.” Brown-nosers was erected in 2003. The approximately 17-foot-tall artwork is supposedly a metaphor for the state of Czech politics. Surprisingly, the giant sculptures can be a bit difficult to find—visitors to Futura must first wind their way through the building’s internal exhibits to reach the back garden.  Buses, trams, and metros bringing you near the place. The fastest way to get there is via the Anděl Prague Metro station and walk for about 15 minutes. This attraction appears within the Futura Gallery O.s. Be sure to check that they are open before you go. They are closed every Monday and most holidays."
138,Tančící dům - Dancing House of Prague,"Prague, Czechia",This tipsy office building in downtown Prague was originally called “Fred and Ginger.”,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tancici-dum-the-dancing-house-of-prague,"When this seven-story building first went up in central Prague, its co-architect, the world-renowned Frank Gehry, dubbed it “Fred and Ginger,” calling to mind the elegance and wit of the famous film couple. Some local residents, not so enamored with the radical design, dubbed it “The Drunk House,” calling to mind a boozy Saturday night along the Vltava River. Over time the structure has built a few metaphorical bridges, and now it’s simply called “The Dancing House of Prague.” Completed in 1996, it took four years to build the Dancing House, designed by Croatian-Czech architect Vlado Milunić in cooperation with Gehry. It sits on land that fronts the river, surrounded by imposing 18th and 19th-century architecture. The previous building on the lot was destroyed during the bombing of Prague in 1945, in the waning days of World War II. It sat in a shattered state until the rubble was finally cleared in 1960. It took another 30 years before new life was breathed into the corner lot, championed by its nextdoor neighbor, President Václav Havel. Havel’s family had lived for decades on the block, and when construction began in 1992 he was serving as the last president of Czechoslovakia. His hope was to create a cultural center along the river. A lot happened during the four years of construction, including the Czech-Slovak split and Havel becoming the first president of Czechia. His support of the Milunić-Gehry co-venture sustained throughout, but the dream of a cultural center did not. The building was instead financed by the Dutch insurance giant Nationale-Nederlanden, and since opening its doors the Dancing House has been used as a post-modern office building. Gehry originally referred to the two columns as “Fred and Ginger,” but later thought better of the imagery. It was hard enough in the early 90s for locals to accept a deconstructionist’s vision for the otherwise Romanesque, Baroque, Gothic, and neo-Renaissance capital of Czechia without then slapping an American name on top of it. So “Fred and Ginger” was dropped, and in the end, most everyone seems to have accepted the Dancing House (even if it might look a little bit tipsy). A more formal acceptance of the building can be seen in the form of a gold coin, issued by the Czech National Bank in 2005, the final in a series called “Ten Centuries of Architecture.”  The building is in downtown Prague, at the corner of the Rasinovo embankment and Resslova Street, by the entrance to the Jirásek Bridge. It’s within walking distance of the Karlovo Namesti underground station. The building is used for offices and not open to public. But you can visit the lobby and the restaurant ""La Perle de Prague"" on the 7th floor, with a nice view of the Vltava River and Prague Castle panorama. The late afternoon and Happy Hour timeframe is the best time to enjoy the upper terrace views at the bar area - there is an outdoor rooftop patio for taking photographs. If you can, go at sunset, the view over the city is incredible."
139,Hlava Franze Kafky (Franz Kafka's Head),"Prague, Czechia","A bust of Franz Kafka spins in pieces, reflecting the writer's inner torment.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hlava-franze-kafky,"Franz Kafka, one of Prague’s most celebrated literary sons (albeit only after his death), was plagued by self-doubt and depression throughout his life. This mirrored, kinetic sculpture of the author seeks to reflect that by physicalizing the ever-turning pieces of the writer’s mind. His face is only there for a moment or two before disintegrating again once the layers begin to twist. Created by artist David Černý, the bust is composed of 42 different layers that rotate individually. Each layer is mechanized, using gears inspired by traditional Czech clockwork, like that of the famed astronomical clock. The patterns in which the layers twist are reprogrammable, meaning they can be entirely randomized, or completely orderly. The bust sits close to the insurance company in downtown Prague where Kafka worked his day job. Černý, who is known for his provocative installation work, was so pleased with the outcome of Hlava Franze Kafky (Franz Kafka’s Head), he made another in North Carolina. Rather than a famed author, he made the bust in the shape of his own head. He kept some reference to Kafka in the title though: “the Metalmorphosis.” Once you are in the area, there are quite a few interesting public art features in the area including Kafka who has some interesting working showing in the area: http://travelphotodiscovery.com/pragues-public-and-street-art-scene/"
140,Man Hanging Out,"Prague, Czechia",What looks like a suicide in progress is actually a statue of Sigmund Freud.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/man-hanging-out,"Dangling above one of the cobblestone streets in Prague’s Old Town is a statue that has caused more than a few people to be concerned that a man is about to plummet to his death, but fear not, it is simply a fake Sigmund Freud. First created in 1996, the work known as “Zavěšený muž” (“Man Hanging Out”) is the vision of Czech sculptor David Černý, whose work can actually be found all across Prague. Many of Cerny’s works are seen as somewhat deliberately provocative, and this one is no different. The dangling Freud is surprisingly lifelike at a distance, and a number of people have sincerely taken it for a person in danger. However, it is simply a sculptural statement about intellectualism in the 20th century and Černý’s uncertainty about it. The piece, even if it was somewhat controversial, was still quite popular after its unveiling and was able to tour the world, being displayed in places ranging from London to Grand Rapids, Michigan. However, the piece is back in Prague, hanging extended over a tight, historic street, causing passersby to look away from the ancient surrounds and take a look up to ponder the future. With luck, Freud won’t be coming down anytime soon, and neither will 20th-century intellectualism.  Look up at the intersection of Husova and Skorepka"
141,Nuclear Bunker Museum,"Prague, Czechia","Buried five stories underground, this Soviet bunker is packed with gas masks and Cold War paraphernalia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nuclear-bunker-museum,"Behind an unassuming graffitied wall is an old Soviet bunker which today evokes the paranoia and violence of the Cold War years. A civilian bunker lies buried five stories beneath Prague’s decrepit Parukarka hill, a product of the fear of nuclear armageddon that penetrated the masses during the Cold War. Though both sides of the Iron curtain became obsessed with preparing for the possibility of a nuclear war, such bunkers were constructed with more frequency in the Eastern Bloc, as communist economies fully focused their resources on defense and army structures. This bunker was not designed to house its inhabitants for decades, or even for years. Studies at the time found that there were many psychological risks associated with keeping people within the bunkers for extended periods of time, such as suicide and mass panic. So instead, the civilian bunker in Parukarka park was meant to save civilians from immediate death in face of nuclear explosions, and the idea was that they would evacuate to the countryside soon thereafter. Today, you can explore the remnants of Soviet era paranoia on a two-hour-long guided tour, which takes you through some of the communist spots in Prague’s Old Town and ends in the nuclear bunker. The museum within the bunker serves as a snapshot of Soviet life, and in addition to the requisite dozens of gas masks, contains books, newspapers and photographs from the time.   The nuclear bunker is only accessible through guided tours, which occur daily at 10:30 am and 2:30 pm. Tickets can be purchased online or at the tour's starting point, the Prague Special Tours ticket office at Old Town Square."
142,Tivoli Gardens,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen's celebrated theme park and gardens.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tivoli-gardens,"Tivoli, which opened in 1843, is the second-oldest amusement park in the world (after nearby Dyrehavsbakken, which opened in 1583). Consolation prize: Tivoli, with its merry-go-round and boat rides, resident symphony orchestra, and Chinese harlequin theater (which is designed like a peacock), is the most visited amusement park in Scandinavia. At night its gardens are made bright with colored lamps and hundreds of thousands of little lights. Located in the center of Copenhagen, Tivoli is an urban phenomenon and is surrounded by the town hall square, the Hans Christian Andersen house, and the main train station. It was founded by Georg Cartensen, who was given a five-year commission by King Christian VIII; Cartensen reportedly persuaded the king by telling him, “when the people are amused, they do not think about politics.” From the beginning, the park included restaurants, cafés, a theater, gardens and flower beds, a merry-go-round, and fanciful Oriental-style buildings. In 1964, the Beatles played at Tivoli. Michael Jackson offered to buy it. Walt Disney once described the park as “happy, with an unbuttoned air,” and he borrowed heavily from its whimsy for Disneyland. Disney even told his wife, “Now this is what an amusement place should be!” But Tivoli is more tranquil than the Disney parks, perhaps more tranquil than any other theme park, full of cozy gardens and fountains and scattered benches. Dæmonen (The Demon) roller coaster opened in 2004 and is one of the most expensive structures in the park. It is a floor-less coaster, which means that a rider’s legs dangle during the ride. Tivoli is probably the most famous landmark in Copenhagen - if not in all of Denmark. In 1944, the Nazis attempted to burn it down. But the Danes rebuilt and reopened the park within weeks. Other famous rides include The Star Flyer, The flying trunk, and Rutschebanen, which is the oldest roller coaster in Europe that is still in use.  By bus: Take 10, 15, 26, 30, 40, 66, 2A, 5A , 6A or 250S. By train: Central Station or Vesterport station."
143,Superkilen,"Copenhagen, Denmark",An ultra-modern diversity park in Denmark has turned an entire city block electric pink.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/superkilen,"Copenhagen’s Superkilen park has transformed a portion of the city into a multicultural celebration by mixing design elements from across the globe with futuristic high art touches including a massive public thoroughfare that is completely covered in bright pink geometry. Located just north of the bustling city center, Superkilen park is located in what is considered one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in Copenhagen; an aspect of the city that the park was created to celebrate. The space itself if broken up into three different zones: The Red Square, The Black Market, and The Green Park. Each portion of the space lives up to the colors described in their names with The Red Square covering a wide public walkway in angular neon pink, orange, and red shapes; The Black Market consisting of black asphalt which is given texture by a series of tight white lines that curve and zag across the space, and which is centered on a glistening black octopus whose abstract form also acts as a children’s playground; and finally The Green Park is more of a traditional series of lawns formed into round shapes and blobs of nature. The main themes of each section is presented in a stark, high art motif, making it look like a psychedelic park of the future. In addition to the large-scale design themes, the sections of the park are filled with benches, lamps, and features that have been taken from over 50 different countries. Here there are some benches imported from Brazil and a streetlamp from Iraq, there a trash can from England and a neon sign advertising a Chinese salon. All together the park creates a sense of futuristic global culture coming together to mix and collide in one space. The Superkilen park was opened in 2012 to unsurprisingly international acclaim and continues to stand as a symbol of not just one Copenhagen neighborhood’s growing diversity, but the entire world’s growing interconnectedness. Also the color pink."
144,Cisternerne,"Frederiksberg, Denmark",A 19th-century subterranean reservoir repurposed as a contemporary art cave.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cisternerne,"Some of the most avant-garde contemporary art in Copenhagen is quite literally underground. Cisternerne is an old subterranean reservoir that supplied drinking water to all of Copenhagen from the 1850s until the 1930s, and also doubled as a reflection pool for the nearby Frederiksberg Castle. When the cisterns were finally drained and covered in 1981, they were used as an exhibition space for modern glass art for a decade before they were adopted into the Frederiksberg Museum. Today, Cisternerne, which lies below the grounds of Søndermarken park, functions as a multimedia installation space. The only indication of its presence are the two towering glass pyramids that mark its entrance and exit points. When you descend into the dripstone cave (the only one of its kind in Denmark), the atmosphere changes drastically. The air is typically at 100 percent humidity, but the temperature is usually a cool 47˚F. Impressive stalactites and stalagmites extend from the floor and ceiling, but it’s the art people come to see in this unique setting. The Frederiksberg Museum commissions an artist to create an exhibition for Cisternerne every year. The artists use the unusual cavern setting—along with its darkness, humidity, and reverberant acoustics—to create equally unusual art. The dark, dank series of tunnels prove to be an excellent, if sometimes creepy, backdrop for light and video installations. Past installations include a mossy replica of a Japanese shrine by Hiroshi Sambuichi.  The entrance to Cisternerne is located in Søndermarken just across from Frederiksberg Palace and the Copenhagen Zoo. The entry is located in a pyramid of glass (see photo). As the cisterns are naturally very damp, waterproof shoes are highly recommended. Also be prepared for a temperature drop once down in the tunnels, and be aware of the presence of lye in the water."
145,Grundtvig’s Church,"Copenhagen, Denmark",This sublime architectural marvel is a rare example of an expressionist church.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grundtvigs-church,"Located just outside Copenhagen, this monumental Gothic-style church is one of the most distinctive in the city. Indeed, it looks unlike any other church in the world. More than 6 million yellow bricks form a serene, minimalist look, juxtaposed with a soaring facade that evokes the shape of a church organ. Grundtvig’s Church was built to honor N.F.S. Grundtvig, a 19th-century Danish philosopher, historian, poet, and reformer. His influential ideas earned him a monument in his name, designed by master architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint shortly after World War I. The design is meant to be a synthesis of numerous building styles, merging the scale of Gothic vertical architecture with geometric expressionism and traditional Danish styles. Inspired by Grundtvig’s work, Jensen-Klint based the design primarily on the stepped gabled churches found in the local villages, but on a far grander scale. The massive church is 259 feet long with the nave soaring 72 feet high. The interior can hold about as many people as Copenhagen Cathedral. To balance the Gothic proportions of the interior, more than 6 million yellow bricks, a traditional Danish material, were uniformly used in keeping with classic Danish minimalism. The yellow color was chosen to represent ascension, literally and spiritually, and indeed, the church seems to be ever-reaching toward the Sun."
146,The Little Mermaid,"Copenhagen, Denmark",The de facto symbol of Copenhagen is this bronze fairytale which cannot seem to keep its head for very long.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-little-mermaid-copenhagen-denmark,"Installed in 1913, The Little Mermaid basks leisurely atop its water-locked rock as the symbol of the city of Copenhagen. But notoriety has led to the figure’s head being removed a number of times in protest. Inspired by a ballet performance of the classic folktale, the piece was originally commissioned by the son of a local beer magnate and has now been gracing the waters off of Copenhagen for more than a century. The lounging figure stares wistfully into the distance, features forever frozen in a look of sadness, perhaps due to the constant threat of decapitation the mermaid has faced since her inception. As the piece became a popular tourist attraction, it soon became an unofficial mascot for the entire city. With this attention came a number of protests and random acts of vandalism to befall the statue. The mermaid’s head was first stolen in 1964 by political dissidents, and was never recovered. A new head was grafted onto the body, but then the statue’s arm was taken off in 1984. The arm was later recovered, but then another decapitation attempt in 1990 left a wide gash in the figure’s neck. In 1998 the head was once again stolen— but this time recovered— and finally, in 2003, the entire statue was blown off its rock with explosives. This little mermaid simply can’t seem to catch a break. Today the statue has been restored and still draws countless admirers each year. Yet it seems like only a matter of time before the mythical maid is imperiled once again."
147,Elephant Gate,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Pre-Nazi swastikas adorn the sculpted pachyderms flanking this brewhouse portal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephant-gate,"No tour of the Carlsberg Brewery is complete without a visit to the famous Elephant Gate, with its four life-sized granite elephant statues that, uh…whoa, hey, wait a minute. Do those elephants have giant swastikas on their sides? They do indeed, but the symbol signified something else entirely when the gate was first built. Completed in 1901, the Elephant Gate was part of a building complex for the Ny (New) Carlsberg Brewhouse, started by Carl Jacobson to compete directly with his father who owned the original Carlsberg Brewery (thereafter renamed the Gamle — or Old — Carlsberg Brewery). When first launching this contentious new venture in 1882, Carl felt the need to adopt a symbol that would bring good luck and prosperity and chose the swastika, which since ancient times had been associated with good fortune (in fact, the word “swastika” comes from a Sanskrit word meaning “lucky or auspicious object”). Used in the official trademark for Ny Carlsberg, the swastika suddenly became quite inauspicious in the 1930s, and its use by the brewery was forever discontinued in 1940. The elephant statues, however, remain and include other symbolism beyond the now-stomach-churning good luck charms. Each elephant bears the initials of one of Carl’s four remaining children (four other children had died by the time the gate was built); thus, the swastikas were meant not only to bring good fortune to the brewery but also health and prosperity to each surviving child. Moreover, Carl saw elephants themselves as symbols of stability, vigor, and loyalty — an image which is perhaps somewhat undercut by going into business against your dad, but was generally pretty good for the brand long-term. Carl sponsored the elephants at the Copenhagen Zoo; the brewery stables occasionally housed elephants; and Carlsberg eventually launched a strong, rich, “Elephant Beer” in 1959. The Elephant Gate is the most famous Carlsberg landmark, and once served as one of two portals to the Ny Carlsberg complex. The tower above the gate once served as a water tower and herb silo, but now it stands vacant, as does the rest of the old facility; on-site beer production stopped entirely in 2008, and the landmarked buildings are now being redeveloped into a new residential neighborhood. Update: As of August 2019, the gate is currently obstructed by construction.  The gate is a stop on the brewery tour, which can be booked in advance."
148,The Genetically Modified Little Mermaid,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Hans Christian Andersen for the postmodern world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-genetically-modified-little-mermaid-copenhagen-denmark,"Danish-Icelandic sculptor Edvard Eriksen’s “Little Mermaid” is one of Denmark’s most visited tourist attractions. The bronze statue, based on Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale of the same name, is as iconic to Copenhagen as the Statue of Liberty is to New York City. But it’s been a popular target for vandals over the years—she’s lost her head, twice. It’s an unfortunate state of affairs considering its origin: Brewer/philanthropist Carl Jacobsen commissioned the statue after being moved by a ballet production of the fairy tale. Bjørn Nørgaard’s Mermaid, on the other hand… In 2006, not quite 100 years after Eriksen’s iconic mermaid was introduced, Bjørn Nørgaard, a professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, created “The Genetically Altered Paradise.” A news release described the piece as “a provocative and humorous look at postmodern society.” Located a quarter of a mile from the beloved tourist attraction are contorted, abstract sculptures of Adam, Eve, Mary Magdalene, Christ, a pregnant man, and “The Genetically Modified Little Mermaid.” This mermaid is also bronze and sits in a position similar to Eriksen’s, but her twisted figure, with elongated skeletal legs and an unrecognizable head, is a criticism of genetic alterations. The mermaid has avoided vandalism so far. Maybe it’s because, as Nørgaard says, she’s already “fighting against the order of nature”; any further modification would be superfluous. The statues, originally shown at the Danish pavilion at the Expo 2000 World’s Fair in Hanover, Germany, circle a sandstone arch topped with a 15-foot Madonna statue. They’re only a 10-minute walk from Erikson’s mermaid and, for those interested, offer a sobering alternative to his romanticism. Not on the main river side, a little up further north from the famous Little Mermaid."
149,Forgotten Giants,"Ishøj, Denmark",Six beautiful wooden giants are hidden around Copenhagen.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/forgotten-giants,"Hiding giants is a tall order, but Thomas Dambo has managed to hide six in the area around Copenhagen. Dambo is an artist who specializes in reclaimed and recycled materials, and the Forgotten Giants are no exception to this method, created from scrap wood collected from old, demolished buildings and felled trees. The sculptures were deliberately placed off the beaten track, and each is accompanied by a poem engraved on a nearby stone that gives hints about where it is hidden. There is also a “treasure map” of the area on which an “X” marks the spot where each giant can be found. Part of the point of the public artwork is to get people out and exploring, especially to beautiful places they don’t normally go. Dambo also hopes his scrap wood giants will encourage people to recycle. Each giant is named after one of the volunteers who helped build it, and every one has an extra function. Sleeping Louis, named after one of Dambo’s former assistants, references homeless people found sleeping in the area where Louis now lies. Louis provides shelter for the homeless; the giant structure can be entered through his gaping mouth. Another giant, Hill Top Trine, has hands that double as an overlook for visitors to climb into and enjoy the same view she does. Thomas On The Mountain (not named after Dambo himself, but an intern of the same name) has legs long enough for a lot of people to sit and relax, like the giant himself. Teddy Friendly, named after a friendly teacher, extends his arm to help people cross a nearby stream, while Oscar Under the Bridge helps hold up the bridge over Lille Vejlesø. Appropriately, scrap wood from an old water mill was used to make him. He was named after an artist from Chile. Finally, Little Tilde, who looks across a small lake, has 28 built-in birdhouses.  The coordinates are for Oscar Under the Bridge. The rest of the giants are in the surrounding area. A map showing the locations of the other five giants can be found on Thomas Dambo's website."
150,Freetown Christiania,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Danish tourist destination well known for open stalls where vendors sell marijuana on the street.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/freetown-christiania,"Freetown Christiania, or simply Christiania, is a neighborhood of only 850 residents in the Danish capital of Copenhagen that is largely known both inside and outside of the country as a big headache. Authorities regard Christiania as a large commune, as it is regulated by a special 1989 law that transferred supervisory powers from the municipality to the state. Created as a squatted military zone in 1971, Christiania has always had a special relationship with the law. Almost immediately after it was founded, Christiania became known as a hub for cannabis trade, an act that was tolerated by authorities until 2004. This isn’t surprising, as after the military moved out of the area, homeless people took to the empty buildings which were guarded by only a small collection of watchmen. It wasn’t organized, but some claim that the takeover of the town by homeless men, women, and children was an act of protest against the Danish government in response to a lack of affordable housing in the city. Christiania has been a sort of hippie town ever since. Christinites, as they are known, have always been fond of meditation and yoga, only two examples of the many recreational outlets available here. The town also hosted an internationally renowned theatre troupe. Many Danes outside of the commune see the town as a successful social experiment, a place where entrepreneurs are as highly regarded and valued as the drug addicts who take refuge in the area because of the ongoing negotiations concerning the legality of substance abuse. The rules in Christiania, which has developed within the commune and outside of any interaction with the traditional Danish government, forbid violence, guns, knives, hard drugs, stealing, bulletproof vests, and bikers’ colors. While drugs such as cocaine and heroin are banned in the town, vendors sell marijuana from open stands that line Pusher Street, Christiania’s main strip. It is best to go during quieter times of the year, when the local residents are more relaxed and willing to chat to tourists. Further out from Pusher Street, you’ll find small art galleries and boutiques."
151,Verdenskortet,"Hobro, Denmark","A walkable map of the world, made from soil and stone by one man.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/verdenskortet,"Circumnavigating the globe on foot sounds like a tall order - requiring commitment of years of one’s life, some serious logistics planning, and an unshakeable determination to put one foot in front of the other for as long as it takes. For those keen on the idea but not the long haul, there’s Verdenskortet (Map of the World) in Denmark. At the Verdenskortet attraction, visitors can march across all the world’s countries in a matter of minutes and then have a cup of coffee and a pastry at the adjoining cafe. Amazingly, the outdoor atlas was constructed entirely from soil and stone. Even more amazingly, it’s all the work of one man. Søren Poulsen was born in 1888 on the property and moved to the United States when he was a young man. After 20 years abroad, he moved back to the family farm on the banks of Lake Klejtrub. Following a failed orchard grove venture, he turned his attention in 1944 to the project that would consume him until his death at 81 years old in 1969. Always interested in geography, Poulsen decided to lay out the entire world through shaping a small peninsula on the lake. He did so with the use of a few simple tools (a wheelbarrow, a pushcart, handtools) and a whole lot of ingenuity - some of the stones he single-handedly hauled to the site weigh more than a ton. The finished map measures 45 by 90 meters, and is entirely to scale - each 27 centimeters corresponds to 111 real-world kilometers. It has become a popular family attraction in the Viborg area, as visitors take the opportunity to play minigolf along the shore and paddle rowboats in the miniature Pacific Ocean. It’s certainly a charming site, and an Atlas Obscura if we ever saw one."
152,The Blue Planet,"Kastrup, Denmark",Vortex-shaped aquarium hosts Europe's largest school of piranhas and other ocean creatures.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-blue-planet-kastrup-denmark,"The striking architecture of the Blue Planet aquarium resembles a swirl of metal tentacles, and inside its gleaming structure are 20,000 fish and ocean creatures. Opened in 2013, the Blue Planet replaced Denmark’s national aquarium, which itself opened in 1939. The old aquarium had the misfortune to open at the same time that World War II broke out so it was not a great time to be in the aquarium business, especially as they could no longer import fish. The hallways of the old aquarium also had awful ventilation, so that when it first opened people would pass out from the suffocating air. In 1944, a city strike caused the power to go out and staff used pedal power to pump oxygen into the tanks to keep the fish from an untimely demise. As the museum outgrew its space and became desperately in need of repairs, the original building was closed in 2012. The futuristic Blue Planet features 3,000 of the animals that were in the old aquarium, along with 17,000 additional watery fauna, including hammerhead sharks, sea lions, and Europe’s largest school of piranhas. Ambient music accompanies walks down its hallways that have blue swaying lights to replicate the feeling of being underwater."
153,Museum Obscurum,"Nykøbing Falster, Denmark",This secret collection of the strange and occult was rediscovered in a forgotten room of an old house.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-obscurum,"Museum Obscurum is the enigmatic curio cabinet of an eccentric 19th-century collector named Cornelius S.C. Rödder. He was a wealthy man who collected anything that amazed him, as private collectors often did. After a visit to London, his interests turned towards the mysterious, the cryptozoological, and the occult. Rödder established a “dark” collection with a secret entrance in his house, where he kept his vampire skeleton, collection of fairies, and other supernatural specimens. This secret collection was nearly lost, until in 2017 the Museum Obscurum rediscovered a series of crates behind a locked door in a forgotten room. The museum reconstructed Rödder’s home and put his unusual collection on display in the study. From a werewolf to a stuffed platypus to the skull of the Forest Child, there are many mysterious artifacts to peruse, both mythological and otherwise. The visitor is gently challenged with stranger and stranger specimens and faced with the question: What is real, and what is fake?"
154,Throne of Denmark,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Opulence and fantasy collide in this royal chair which is supposedly made with unicorn horns.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/throne-of-denmark,"As thrones go, it is hard to beat the Throne of Denmark for ambitious construction with its exposed “unicorn” horn and life-size silver lions as its constant companion. Constructed in the late 1600s (long after unicorns supposedly missed the ark) the physical seat of the monarchy of Denmark’s power is a grand throne straight out of a fantasy novel. The regal white throne was originally constructed as a large wooden chair with arches and an intricate canopy, with the extravagant flourish being the spiraling legs and spokes which were said to be made of actual unicorn horn. In reality, no mythical beasts were harmed in the making of the furniture piece, but instead the horns were narwhal tusks which were often passed off as the product of a magical horse in those days. Later kings would add gilded figures who perch on the arm and backrest of the throne adding an extra level of luxury to the seat, but much of its notoriety still stems from the seemingly magical building material. The throne was inspired by the biblical Throne of Solomon which was fabled to be guarded by 12 lions, and to reflect that aspect, the throne is always accompanied by three massive silver lions. The life-size sculptures are arrayed around the throne in resting positions and feature solid gold eyes, manes, and rumps. The Throne of Denmark was mainly used for coronation ceremonies before they were largely omitted from the country’s royal practices, and now the magical seat is simply a wondrous museum piece even though it still acts as the representative seat of the monarchy. Update as of August 2021: The white throne has temporarily moved to the sister castle Koldinghus in Kolding, 144 miles (232 kilometers) west of the Danish capital. There it will stay “for a year or so” before returning to its Copenhagen home at Rosenborg Castle, according to the museum staff."
155,Your Rainbow Panorama,"Aarhus, Denmark",This colorful artistic feature atop a Danish art gallery allows visitors to stroll through a rainbow.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/your-rainbow-panorama,"Ringing the ARoS Aarhus Art Museum in Denmark like a technicolor halo is artist Olafur Eliasson’s permanent work Your Rainbow Panorama, which allows guests to walk around and see the surrounding city through every color of the rainbow. From the orange-yellow ports to the purple houses next door, the city as viewed through the shaded glass walls of the circular walkway is transformed into a new form of monochrome every few feet. The light coming in through the glass paints visitors in an equally strong light making each person strolling through the 150-foot ring into a living crayon. Equally striking from the outside, Your Rainbow Panorama makes ARoS one of the easiest buildings in the city to find. From the ground people can watch as tiny figures of people walk around and around taking in colorful new views at every turn. Eliasson, the Danish-Icelandic artist of Your Rainbow Panorama, was reputedly inspired by Dante’s Divine Comedy and finally reaching the perfection of Paradise. He created Your Rainbow Panorama to add to something that was already there (the view of Aarhus) and to make people think about where art ends and the museum begins. If you go there on a really quiet day, try shouting and enjoy hearing your own voice coming from behind as it travels around the circular space."
156,Church of Our Saviour,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Climb to the top of its spiral spire for spectacular views of Copenhagen.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-of-our-saviour-copenhagen,"A corkscrew-shaped tower stretches from the top of this church. Climb to the tip, and you’ll be rewarded with breathtaking views of Copenhagen. At the beginning of the 17th century, King Christian IV launched an effort to expand Copenhagen by building several fortifications and canals southward on the island of Amager. The newly occupied area needed a church, so construction on the Church of Our Savior began in 1695. The tower of the church, which was designed by Lambert Van Haven, did not have a spire. Decades later, Lauritz de Thurah designed a spire, drawing inspiration from the spiral shape of Rome’s Sant’Ivo alla Sapienza. It was inaugurated on August 28, 1752, by King Frederik V. The copper-clad wooden spire stands on an octagonal base and features semicircular arches and round windows with gilded frames. Four statues guard its base. The stairs—150 in total—twist counterclockwise, looping around the tower four times. A plinth holding a gilded globe and a sculpture of Jesus stands at the end.  You can arrive by subway at the Christianshavn station."
157,Kulturtårnet,"Copenhagen, Denmark",A little-known cafe in an old copper bridge tower with 360-degree views of the harbor.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kulturtarnet,"Found by walking across the Christianshavn side of the Knippelsbro bridge, this bright teal yet unassuming river tower turned cafe is almost submarine-like as it sits at the side of the harbor. Most people find this gem by accident while walking across the bridge; many Danes don’t even know of its existence. The river tower itself has been around for 80 years, but the cafe found its home here just a few years ago. The tower operates as a place for the community to come together for cultural events and good food. Once you spot the tower with the big white flag, run over and grab a coffee while taking in the sights and sounds of Copenhagen. Walk up the lit staircase and you’ll come across two dining rooms before reaching the outdoor tables and chairs. Sitting on the deck is peaceful and the atmosphere inside is cozy and fun. It is highly recommended to talk with the staff and creator, they have interesting stories to share and may even teach you a few Danish words. Wednesday - Saturday:
