0,Oceanographic Museum,"Monaco, Monaco","Museum celebrating the ocean, with the largest wunderkammer dedicated to sea exploration.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oceanographic-museum-monaco,"The Musée Océanographique (Oceanographic Museum) of Monaco is one of the largest scientific institutions dedicated to the study of the ocean. In its aquariums are around 6,000 species of sea creatures, and it also holds an incredible array of specimens collected during 20th century exploration. In 2011, the museum commissioned artist Mark Dion to create a new arrangement of the collection in the tradition of a cabinet of curiosity. Drawing from the archives, Dion resurrected many forgotten pieces of the vast collection founded by Prince Albert the 1st, thematically arranged in a 10-foot-high display. Between the polar bear, the antique diving suit, and the giant corals, Mark Dion’s marine wunderkammer is spectacular  in size and variety, a breathtaking display that will arouse your thirst for science."
1,Juan Manuel Fangio Statue,"Monaco, Monaco",This statue of the great Argentinian car driver is located near a famous curve of the Monaco Grand Prix.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/juan-manuel-fangio-statue,"The Principality of Monaco paid tribute to the memory of Juan Manuel Fangio, a five-time Formula One world champion, with a life-sized bronze statue of the Argentine driver. It was at this location that he won races in 1950 and 1957. Fangio, also known as El Chueco, was considered one of the best Formula One car drivers in the world. The statue of the famed driver was dedicated by Prince Albert of Monaco. The event was attended by other car drivers like Emerson Fittipaldi and Niki Lauda. The artwork was crafted by Spanish sculptor Joaquim Ros Sabaté and is located near the entrance to the city of Monaco. There are five other sculptures by Ros Sabaté located around the world of the driver. However, this one in particular stands out because it’s located right on the Rascasse curve of the Monaco street circuit. The sculpture depicts Fangio leaning on his Mercedes Benz W196 which earned him one of his victories at the Monaco Grand Prix."
2,Automatons and Dolls of Yesteryear,"Monaco, Monaco",Thousands of costumed dolls fill one of the world's creepiest museums.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-museum-of-automatons-and-dolls-of-yesteryear,"Organized by Madeleine de Galea during the 19th century, the Automatons and Dolls of Yesteryear collection at the Monaco National Museum has been called one of the creepiest in the world. Exhibits inside of the Charles Garnier-designed villa include a seemingly endless display of costumed characters in beautiful clothes displayed alongside miniature household items. Originally stored in de Galea’s personal mansion, the collection grew so fast she was forced to purchase the house next-door for extra storage space. In addition to the thousands of period dolls, the museum houses a large collection of automatons. You can see the intricate wind-up creations at any time during the museum’s regular hours, but if you sign up for a tour, the guide will likely activate many of the pieces. Some of the dolls double as automatons, breathing, sighing and playing the piano. Outside of the museum, visitors can enjoy a rose and sculpture garden.  From the train station, take the 4 bus toward Saint- Romain. Stop at Place des Moulins and tale the elevator down to Avenue Princesse Grace."
3,Cats Museum,"Kotor, Montenegro",A curious little museum dedicated to the furry feline in the cat haven that is Old Town Kotor.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cats-museum,"For cat lovers, there is no place like the medieval town of Kotor, Montenegro. The town, which was founded by the Romans in 168 BC, has a noticeably high cat population. For centuries, Kotor served as a trading port for ships from all over the world, and many of the cats who were on the ships were left behind, ultimately populating the small town with a diverse array of felines. The cats are a part of daily life in Kotor, acting as a symbol for the entire town. In fact, Kotor even has a museum dedicated to their furry residents. Tucked into an unassuming building in the heart of Old Town, the Cats Museum (Museo del Gatto di Cattaro) is a charming sight to be seen for cat lovers and loathers alike.Visitors who find their way into the tiny museum are granted access to an unusual collection of cat works from writings, coins, lithographs and much more. For those with a certain niche humor, the collection of postcards featuring cats doing human things is a must-see, while the more historically inclined will surely appreciate the pieces dating back a few centuries. In fact, an entire section of the museum is dedicated to cat artifacts dated before and during the First World War. These range from war propaganda to postcards sent from soldiers, and the care taken to preserve these strange treasures is evident. Despite its small size (just two little rooms connected by a hallway), the Cats Museum has an impressive list of registered members—all of whom have four legs. For those with only two legs, the museum does come at a cost. The admission fee, just 1 euro, does more than keep the glass cases clean; the museum also supports the local feline community through the money earned. A gift shop sells cat memorabilia alongside small bags of food to feed the many cats of Kotor who are, of course, always welcome."
4,Fortifications of Kotor,"Kotor, Montenegro","These historic defenses ensured the city within would survive hundreds of years of occupations, sieges, and invasions.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fortifications-of-kotor,"Located on the Bay of Kotor (Boka kotorska in Montenegrin), a natural fjord near the coast of the Adriatic Sea, the city of Kotor is the oldest town in Montenegro with its roots in the ancient world. Archaeologists aren’t exactly sure, but it may have been built on top of another city as far back as 700 to 400 BCE. While the very earliest history may not be clear, the consensus is that the Greeks colonized the city starting around the 3rd century BCE. The natural steps and slopes of the hills were used as coveted protection by the ancients, but it’s also the structured walls that are striking, the majority of them are known as defensive Venetian in design and construction. The city is ancient, but the fortifications are mostly medieval. The list of attackers, occupiers, and invaders of Kotor is long, including (not in exact order) Illyrians, Romans, Byzantines, Venetians, Ottomans and Austrians. Even, at certain times, Russians, Serbians, British and Hungarians. And if invasions and attacks weren’t enough, there have been earthquakes to contend with – a major quake damaged the site as recently as 1979. Navigating the crags of the hills and walls must have proven challenging to invaders, as they tried to find their way through the jumbled warren of Kotor’s streets and walls. But they built the city this way on purpose, to keep those invaders from figuring out exactly where they were. And jutting so dramatically straight up out of the fjord, it’s easy to see why everyone wanted a piece of it. There are three gates into the Old Town to choose from"
5,Ostrog Monastery,Montenegro,A curious cave church carved into the face of a cliff.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ostrog-monastery,"The 1600s were a turbulent time in the Balkans. The small Principality of Montenegro was fighting for survival against the mighty Ottoman Empire. Threatened by Ottoman raiders, many Orthodox Christians took to the mountains. Ostrog monastery was carved out of a vertical mountainside of of Ostroška Greda. Founded by Vasilije, the Bishop of Herzegovina and later known as St. Vasilije of Ostrog, his body is enshrined in a reliquary kept within the cool dark walls of the cave-church. Word spread quickly of the supposed miraculous healing powers of his mortal remains, and the monastery become a center of pilgrimage not only for Orthodox Christians but Catholics and Muslims as well. The tradition of pilgrimage continues to this day, with Ostrog still receiving visitors from far and wide of varying faiths, with an especially large celebration taking place on Pentecost. Much of the present look of the cave monastery complex dates from a 1923-1926 renovation after a fire. The monastery was seriously damaged in the blaze, but luckily two of the original cave chapels were spared and remain in their original condition. St. Vasilije of Ostrog is still there as well, though, over the years he has lost some of his “original condition.” From Podgorica take the road to Niksic. Some 15km after Danilovgrad you arrive in the village of Bogatic. At Bogatic you take the right turn and leave the main road. Ostrog is 8km uphill."
6,Our Lady of the Rocks,Montenegro,A tiny church on a man-made island in the Adriatic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/our-lady-of-the-rocks,"Gospa od Skrpjela (Our Lady of the Rocks) is the name of one of two tiny islands located in the inner part of Boka Kotorska bay, near the old town or Perast. The peculiar fact about these island is that they are almost completely man made. The island began as a pile of rocks, and according to legend, on 22nd of July 1452, two fishermen, brothers Moršić discovered an image of Virgin Mary there. A tiny Orthodox chapel was built on the site. In the 1600s Venetians took over the region of Boka and the city of Perast. In 1630 they built a Catholic chapel on the place of original orthodox one. They decided to further expand the island by piling rocks from the mainland and by sinking the old ships. The custom remains to this day. Every 22nd of July at sunset citizens of Perast take their boats and throw rocks into the sea. The custom is known as fašinada. The church visible today dates from 1722. It houses a venerable 15th century icon of Virgin Mary, the work of Lovro Dobričević, now know as Our Lady of the Rocks, and an altar made of Carrara marble is a work of Genovese sculptor Antonio Capelano. Behind the church there is a small museum dedicated to history of Perast. The courtyard in front is known as “Place of Reconciliation.” Today the small island church acts as a sort of cultural center of Catholics of Boka. It has served for public gatherings and as a place where local disputes were settled, most importantly blood feuds between the catholic families of Boka, preventing many vendettas.  Ferry connection available from most towns in Boka Kotorska. Quickest and cheapest from Perast. Utilizing the local public bus (€1), it took a half-hour to get from Kotor to Perast, where you are dropped off on the main square that fronts the water.  So different from the walled city of Kotor, Perast has an air of a posh waterfront town, yet the feel of a fishing village. Alternatively, there are a couple of private taxi boats, that charge €10 for the return trip as of April. 2022."

A side of the tree is unfortunately completely burnt out, due to a lightning strike."
8,Sveti Stefan,"Sveti Stefan, Montenegro",This exclusive resort has completely covered a tiny Balkan island in a 5-star warren of guest rooms.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sveti-stefan,"The Sveti Stefan resort is crammed on a tiny little offshore speck of land that once held an itty-bitty village, having converted the cram of historic buildings into exclusive lodging for its guests. The little island off of the Montenegro coast is only a little over a mile around making space on the isle a hot commodity. Originally a coastal defense was established on the land which eventually grew into a small village that was home to around 400 citizens, who built houses on every available inch of the island making it look as though they might fall right off the edge into the Adriatic. When the country came under communist rule plans were made to turn the area into a tourist spot and the villagers were relocated to the mainland by the government in order to make room for the new resort. A thin isthmus was built to connect the island to the mainland and all of the old houses were converted into singular lodgings, and the Sveti Stefan (which is the name of the resort, not the island) was born. The vacation spot had its ups and downs over the years, losing much of its luster during the 1990s in the face of government turmoil. However by the 2000s it was refurbished and once again brought up to an exclusive 5-star standard by the Aman hotel group. Today the resort is a beautiful little secret island that is off limits to anyone who is not a guest. It may have been converted into a place of leisure, but the Sveti Stefan is still a fortress of sorts, only now it simply protects elitism.  While traveling North/South through Croatia, this island sits at the end of a road cutting through Croatia, giving Bosnia access to the coast. One may not disembark a vehicle and set foot on land here as it is not Croatia but a foreign country."
9,Fortress Gorazda,"Škaljari, Montenegro",This World War I fortress is the perfect place to catch a Montenegrin sunset.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fortress-gorazda,"This Austro-Hungarian fortress was used by the Austrians during World War I, as they traded artillery shells with Montenegrin forces. It was originally constructed around 1884-1886. Although the turret guns are long gone, the fortress and all its glory still remain. The fortress was later used as a prison during the mid-20th century. Now, it sits completely abandoned on top of a mountain overlooking both the bay of Kotor and Tivat. Although it’s now now covered in graffiti, it remains an amazing place to explore. It’s also an excellent spot to watch the sunset. The views are probably among the best in the entire region.  Getting there can be a challenge. You need a car and there are several sharp turns on the way up. There are also no street lights on the way back down after sunset.

10,Mamula Island,Montenegro,"Former military fort and site of untold horrors during WWII, this island may become the Adriatic's next luxury resort.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mamula-island,"The government of Montenegro has big plans for this haunting, uninhabited islet in the Adriatic Sea. Built in 1853, the first life of the island of Malma was that of an Austro-Hungarian military fort. The island, however, became most notorious during World War II for the isolated concentration camp built atop the footprint of the former’s ramparts. From May 30, 1942 until the end of the war, Benito Mussolini’s forces used Mamula Island to house thousands of individuals against their will. Though specific record-keeping practices wasn’t a forte of the regime, Mamula was known for being a den of cruelty and torture. At least 130 deaths were associated with the place, most of which resulted from starvation. After the closure of the concentration camp, Mamula and the rest of the buildings were left to moulder. No one has lived on the island since. Though the island is situated at an ideal distance from shore for that remote feel, paired with easy access, no efforts to redevelop the land or the buildings — including hundreds of cells once used to hold prisoners — until now. Montenegro’s officials have a plan to refurbish the crumbling fort. In this bold vision, Mamula would be scrubbed of its darkness to the point of being unrecognizable: the former concentration camp would become a modern, upscale beachside resort. Spa? Check. Infinity pool? Check. VIP nightclub? But of course. The price tag of this venture is an estimated 15 million Euro, and was pitched as an excellent way to create jobs for locals while capitalizing on the region’s booming tourism scene. As of January 2016, a Swiss investment firm has taken the bait. Orascom Development Holding AG signed a 49-year lease to make this nightmare-turned-dream into a reality. Now if only these hypothetical future tourists will remain ignorant of where they’re sleeping…"
11,War Memorial in Ulcinj,"Ulcinj, Montenegro",On top of a resort town as old as the Bronze Age sits an incredible war memorial statue overlooking the beaches below.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/war-memorial-ulcinj,"The resort town of Ulcinj in Montenegro has a rich history and the architecture to go along with it. One monument in particular reflects the period it memorializes through its design. The Ulcinj War Memorial sits on the edge of the mountain-top town and pays homage to Montenegro’s war times, specifically the Yugoslavian air force. Its unique structure resembles wings of a bird, or possibly an airplane, and seems to be keeping watch over the Mala Plaza (meaning Small Beach) below. Ulcinj is a very popular vacation spot during the summer months for many Europeans of Albanian, German, and Italian decent.

12,Mausoleum of Petar II Petrovic-Njegos,"Njeguši, Montenegro",A beautiful mountaintop mausoleum devoted to a Montenegrin icon can't seem to make everyone happy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mausoleum-of-petar-ii-petrovic-njegos,"High atop an otherwise untouched mountaintop in the European country of Montenegro, the Mausoleum of Petar II Petrović-Njegoš remembers one of the region’s beloved leaders with a contest-designed tomb that still could not please many critics. Petar II Petrović Njegoš was more than just the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro. He was a philosopher and a poet, and beyond that he was a beloved political and cultural leader. Njegoš requested to be buried at a tiny chapel he had built before his death in 1851. After he passed, his body was indeed interred in the humble chapel, but it was not to rest there indefinitely. Unfortunately the small chapel was badly damaged during a war and his body was moved to its current mountaintop home. More than a hundred years later in 1974, Montenegrin authorities replaced Njegoš’ burial chapel with an impressive mausoleum designed by someone who had never been to the mountain, inciting protests among a number of citizens. Located within Lovćen National Park, the newly built mausoleum is perched atop one of Mount Lovćen’s two peaks. The dramatic building is reached after taking a long road that winds up the mountain, followed by a hike up 461 steps on foot. Inside the mausoleum is a large granite statue of Njegoš, a darkened room that contains his tomb, and a 360-degree stone viewing circle. One can see more than half of the tiny country from the summit, from the Bay of Kotor to Lake Skadar to Podgorica. On a clear day, even Albania and Croatia are visible. Despite the protests, few can claim that the Mausoleum of Petar II Petrovic-Njegos is not beautiful enough for a national hero."
13,Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ,"Podgorica, Montenegro","Its frescoes depict the likeness of Marshal Tito, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Engels burning in hell.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cathedral-of-the-resurrection-of-christ,"A universe of icons, golden backgrounds, and paintings fills the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Podgorica. Among these overflowing ornaments, as is typical of Orthodox churches, there is a fresco that aroused controversy when the church was consecrated in 2013. Near the vaults toward the top left of the altar, you’ll discover an apocalyptic scene that, at first glance, doesn’t seem extraordinary A frightening creature swims in a burning sea and swallows people in religious garments. Look closer, though, and you’ll spot that among the same eternal flames where Adam and Eve burn are three men who many have identified as Marshal Tito, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Engels. The three men portrayed in the fresco are the personification of a regime that persecuted the believers and the clergy. Even today, the Montenegrin population is divided between those who miss the “good old days” and those who see in communism a plague that ravaged this region for many years. For some people, watching Tito, Marx, and Engels burning in hell is an emancipation from the oppression they suffered in the past. But some say that the resemblance to the three historical figures is rather vague and unintentional. Although it is unusual for orthodox frescoes to depict contemporary themes, the three men are not the only politicians portrayed in the cathedral. The artist could have assumed no one would ever notice those controversial figures among the excess of decorations. Or he may have predicted the controversies his work would trigger, and this is the reason why he preferred to remain anonymous.  The fresco is hidden in the upper area of the basilica. Locating the three figures is not easy, but it can be an exciting treasure hunt."
14,Brutalist Church of Podgorica,"Podgorica, Montenegro",This virtually windowless mass of smooth concrete is the only Catholic church in the city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brutalist-church-of-podgorica,"A short walk from the main shopping boulevard of Podgorica reveals an interesting architectural specimen, the Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus, the only Catholic temple in this otherwise largely Orthodox capital city. This surprising sight looms slightly ominously against the backdrop of rocky hills (one of which gives Podgorica its name). In a way, it honors its surrounds—the slick, concrete façade is austere and overwhelmingly stone grey. The church was built in 1969, at the height of Yugoslavia’s “golden age” of prosperity. It is a fine example of brutalist architecture, which was still very much in fashion at the time. However not many religious buildings were constructed in the style, making this Podgorica temple quite unique. The lines of the structure are straight and clean, the concrete smooth and shiny, and the windows notably absent. The church boasts an imposing 130-foot-tall bell tower and is nicely shaded by surrounding conifers. Yes, it might look a little like a bunker at first sight, but it’s an interesting and oddly calming monument that’s worth a short visit. Even though the place is situated right by a super-busy main road, there is definitely no unnecessary noise here, and it feels like a modern oasis of peace. The interior of the church is kept similarly simple and quiet. Interestingly, the exposed concrete walls do not feel as oppressive as one might imagine. Although the building has virtually no windows, there is a cleverly designed skylight above the altar, giving the main part of the church a halo of sunlight. There are also simple but futuristic lights along the walls, reminiscent of a spaceship. The central feature is an impressive backlit cross, which gives a somewhat otherworldly glow. This church is an intriguing sight, both from the inside and the outside, and not just for architecture lovers. It’s a strangely calming and completely unique place.  The church is a 15-minute walk from the Kraljev Park (King’s Park) in Nova Varoš, downtown. Follow Bulevar Svetog Petra Cetinjskog southeast. The boulevard will change its name to Pete Proleterske Brigade at some point. It will take you over one small bridge and under one railway viaduct. When you get to a big roundabout, immediately after a petrol station, you will see the church on your left."
15,Grahovo Memorial Park,"Grahovo, Montenegro",This memorial to local World War II heroes is slowly being reclaimed by nature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grahovo-memorial-park,"An almost deserted town in rural Montenegro has a small but proud moment in World War II history. But unless you grew up there, you would probably never know it exists. Grahovo, about nine miles from the much more popular Bay of Kotor, was viciously attacked by Austro-German forces during the early stages of the war and effectively burned to the ground. However, on July 13, 1941, a group of locals, led by future national hero Savo Kovačević, successfully attacked and disarmed a group of occupying enemy soldiers. In 1977, as a monument to the indefatigable spirit of the local resistors, a seven-foot-tall bronze statue, was erected on a hill in the center of the town surrounded by 272 concrete squares, each one bearing the name of one of the locals killed during the conflict. Sadly, just two years later, a devastating earthquake shook Montenegro and devastated Grahovo, barely leaving any buildings standing. Due to the poor infrastructure and economic instability of the area, most locals picked up and moved to the larger cities, such as Niksic or the capital, Podgorica, leaving the monument, and the town itself, to slowly decay. Today, only a handful of residents remain in the town and the memorial park is rapidly losing a battle against the invading foliage of the surrounding park. With Montenegrin authorities showing little or no interest in reviving the area anytime soon, Grahovo remains a disappearing monument to resistance awaiting its next hero.  From Kotor Bay, head north on the P11 highway for about nine miles. There is a sign for the one and only road in and out of Grahovo on the left. The monument is about a five-minute drive from the turn off straight down the main street. There is a cafe/bar just at the entrance to the park"
16,Risan Roman Mosaics,"Risan, Montenegro","The only known mosaic depicting the Greek god of sleep, Hypnos.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/risan-roman-mosaics,"Risan is an unassuming village lying on the northernmost shore of the Bay of Kotor. New structures built to welcome tourists mix freely with larger blocks built during the Yugoslavia era, but hidden behind and beneath these, there are remains of older, much older settlements. In fact, Risan is the oldest settlement on the Bay of Kotor. As far back as the 4th century B.C., an ancient manuscript called Pseudo-Scylax mentions Rhizon (modern day Risan) when describing a merchant route around the Mediterranean Sea. During the 1st and 2nd centuries, Risan eventually grew to the apogee of its affluence and importance as part of the Ancient Roman Empire. In the early 20th century, the remains of a noble’s dwelling called Villa Urbana (aka Villa Romana) were accidentally discovered by a team of workers tasked with paving a road. In the year 1930, some cursory excavations were done, but the modest exterior of the Villa Urbana and several layers of debris covering the mosaics convinced the experts that it was not worth continuing. The full extent and importance of this finding was not determined until 1957, when excavations were resumed. After three years of work, five mosaics were placed on display for everyone to see. In total, there are seven rooms in Villa Urbana and they are demarcated by what is left of the original walls, which is to say nothing more than one foot in height. Of these rooms, only five are open to the public, as the restoration work on the remaining two is yet to be completed. In addition, there is a cell with several columns that belonged to the villa, and jars encrusted with mollusk shells that were rescued from the Bay of Kotor. Tiles of three colors were deployed in most of the Risan Roman Mosaics. White tiles are made of material commonly found in the area, the black and blue-grey tiles were imported. The mosaics exhibit different patterns, according to what each room was used for. For example, in the war room, the mosaic depicts a number of double-headed axes and a rosetta, which signified power in Ancient Roman times. A similar theme can be found in the reception room, but instead of a rosetta, at the center of the room is the sun, symbolizing the Roman Empire.  Befittingly, squid and wine can clearly be recognized in the dining room, while the mosaics in the room designated for resting consist of a black and white checkerboard.  However, the masterpiece of these mosaics is in the primary bedroom, where the god of sleep, Hypnos is portrayed reclining on cushions. This is the only image of the Risan Roman Mosaics that deploys tiles of more than three colors. To date, this is the only mosaic in the world that depicts Hypnos. Adjacent to the room with the portrait of Hypnos is the entrance to an underground chamber whose purpose has puzzled archaeologists for decades."
17,Obadov Brijeg,"Danilovgrad, Montenegro",A swan-like monument on Obad's Hill honors those that defended the area from German invaders during WWII.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-on-obads-hill,"In November 1944, the 6th Montenegrin Strike Brigade defended the nearby Danilovgrad Pass from an invasion of German soldiers. The memorial sculpture on Obad’s Hill (Obadov Brijeg) commemorates the 6th Montenegrin Strike Brigade, a group of more than 500 anti-fascist fighters who defended the hill. In the late 1970s, local government and SUBNOR veterans committees in Nikšić and Danilovgrad began to organize the creation of a modest monument complex to commemorate the military victory by the 6th Montenegrin Brigade at Obad’s Hill. The memorial sculpture was designed by the Modernist architect Slobodan Vukajlović. It was completed in 1974 and inaugurated on the 30th anniversary of the defense of Obad’s Hill. Its minimalistic style is interesting in several respects in relation to its shape and form, as it bears a similarity to a swan-like bird.  The monument complex is located off the Nikšić-to-Podgorica highway in Danilovgrad. It appears to be abandoned and no longer maintained."
18,Electric Ladyland: The Museum of Fluorescent Art,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",The world's only museum devoted to the wonders of fluorescence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/electric-ladyland-the-museum-of-fluorescent-art,"Not far from Amsterdam’s famous Anne Frank House is a small museum devoted to far more psychedelic matters. Owned and operated by pony-tailed artist Nick Padalino, Electric Ladyland can be found underneath the similarly-named street-level art gallery, Electric Lady. Electric Ladyland is the world’s first (and seemingly only) museum focusing solely on the magic of fluorescent light. On entering the basement exhibit visitors are surrounded by bulbous, otherworldly shapes creating a fully-immersive environment straight out of a Love Generation fever dream. When the black light comes on, the home-made shapes spring to life as every surface glows with a neon phosphorescence. Patrons are encouraged to explore the psychedelic space at their own pace, taking part in what the owners call “participatory art”. While the main attraction is the experiential room, the museum also features a large collection of rocks and other elements that naturally react to UV light. The glass case full of dull gray stones explodes with flecks of electric color under the black light. The collection also contains various ephemera related to fluorescence such as vintage black light play-sets and informational displays. Anyone looking to experience the exhibit need not bother with any recreational drugs as walking through Electric Ladyland can feel like walking through an acid trip. An acid trip which also instructs you about the science of phosphorescence.  You need to book in advance to visit this attraction. See the museum's website for its up-to-date hours and directions on how to get there."

De Poezenboot is an animal sanctuary floating on a canal in Amsterdam. It was founded by Henriette van Weelde in 1966 as a home for stray, sick, and abandoned felines, and has since grown into an official charity. The house boat accommodates up to 50 cats at once, 14 of which are permanent residents. Human visitors are welcome on the vessel as well. Many come to choose a cat for adoption, but tourists are also welcome to drop in and scratch a kitty behind the ears. As it is a charity, the boat sanctuary stays afloat thanks to donations left by visitors. All the money raised goes toward helping as many Amsterdam cats as possible. The Cat Boat Foundation pays for neutering of cats whose owners cannot afford veterinary care, as well as strays. Volunteers take care of the cats, some of whom are adopted by visitors. The cats are believed to readjust to life on land perfectly well in their new homes.  De Poezenboot is in central Amsterdam, a 10-minute walk from the main station. It's open to visitors three days a week. Check the website for days and hours and make a reservation if you want to visit the cats."

A mask and a heretic fork depict the punishment for gossipers and those accused for muttering heresy. The museum also sports the tools for the worst of criminals, including a hanging cage for those who were to be made an example of and an inquisition chair for a more interactive torment."
22,Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam,"Amsterdam, Netherlands","Established in 1638 to battle the Black Death, Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam is a treasure trove of rare flora.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hortus-botanicus-amsterdam,"It was the 1600s, and a plague had fallen upon the Netherlands. The recent influx of residents in Amsterdam had chased off the herb-tending monasteries and gobbled up land. Frantic doctors desperately needed a solution for propagating medicines as thousands of people succumbed to the ruthless Black Death. The answer—Hortus Botanicus. Established in 1638, Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam ranks as one of the earliest botanical gardens still in existence, although the lofty title of “oldest” is split between the Botanical Garden of Pisa, (est. 1544) and the Botanical Garden of Padua, (est. 1545). Technically, its not even the oldest in the Netherlands, that distinction goes to the nearby Hortus Botanicus Leiden. Despite being fairly far down the list in this category, Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam has other merits that your average tourist may not find impressive, but plant nerds get absolutely giddy about. Originally known as Hortus Medicus, the garden grew medicinal herbs and by 1682 the Dutch East India Company had stocked it full of rare and exotic plants never before seen in this part of the world. Their spectacular cycad collection in the Palm House is home to one of the most fascinating plants in “captivity”, offsets from Wood’s Cycad. Other famous residents include a 2,000-year old agave cactus that dates back to the Roman era, and Victoria amazonica, a lovely water lily whose 150th birthday has come and gone. Every night at dusk during bloom season, Victoria opens up the petals of her white flower, decade after decade. The garden’s coffee plants, Coffea Arabica, are considered the “parents” of 74% of the  coffee plants in the Americas. Curving paths and a hexagonal pavilion are just a few of the features that lend this unique botanical treasure its beauty—a rest from the busy streets of Amsterdam, and a place of pilgrimage for plant enthusiasts from all over the world."
23,KattenKabinet,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",Cat art as far as the eye can see.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kattenkabinet,"The death of a pet can inspire a number of reactions, but rarely has anyone taken their grief and started a museum, as was the case with The Netherlands’ KattenKabinet. The KattenKabinet, or “Cat Cabinet,” was founded by Bob Meijer in 1990 as an act of remembrance for his own departed cat, John Pierpont Morgan. Throughout J.P. Morgan’s nine lives, the feline received birthday gifts from Meijer’s friends such as paintings, a bronze cat statue, and even a recreated American dollar bill with Morgan in place of Washington, and the coda, “We Trust No Dog.” With these pieces already in hand, Meijer began the museum in the bottom floors of his historic 1667 townhouse. While Meijer and his family still live in the upper floors of the old patrician merchant’s house, the public museum rooms display cats of all species and hue, depicted in a variety of mediums from paintings and sculptures to posters and books. While a cheeky collection such as this could be presented as gaudy or tacky, the KattenKabinet is decorated and the artworks displayed in the baroque style of a stuffy classical museum. The classy cat collection has even partnered with such austere establishments as the Museum Van Gogh, Amsterdam to present works of both artistic and feline importance. And like any true collection of art, the KattenKabinet released a catalogue of their works called the “Cat-a-Logue.” Of course the KattenKabinet would be nothing without some live specimens to wander the stoic halls and fill the space with a unique feline aroma. To that end Meijer owns no less than five cats that roam the museum and greet visitors. This museum is more fascinating than a ball of string covered in catnip."
24,Museum Vrolik,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",A curious collection dedicated to human and animal anatomy and pathology.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-vrolik,"A unique and enormous collection of human and animal anatomy and pathology, the University of Amsterdam’s anatomical and embryological museum began as the private collection of Gerardus Vrolik (1775-1859) and his son Willem Vrolik (1801-1863). Both were professors of anatomy at the Athenaeum Illustre, the predecessor of the University of Amsterdam. Willem wrote extensively on deformities, including cyclopia, the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies, and conjoined twins. His personal collection of specimens built onto that of his father, resulting in several thousand items left behind at his death. The collection was purchased by the city of Amsterdam in 1869 and eventually found its home at the university. Other anatomical collections have been added to the museum over the years, including a collection of bone pathology, a dental collection, and other teratological specimens. There are also a number of animal specimens in the collection. The oldest specimens are from the 16th century; the newest specimens were added to the collection around 1950. Since 2011, over 2,000 historical specimens have been on display in Museum Vrolik. The complete collection, of which about 10% is exhibited, consists of 20,000 objects.  Open Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The entrance fee is €7.50 for adults and €3 for children. Guided tour for a group of up to 15 visitors is possible and costs €50. Tours can be requested on Museum Vrolik's website, at least two weeks in advance. How to get there: Museum Vrolik is located in the Academic Medical Centre in J0 (J-zero). By metro: exit on the station Holendrecht and walk eight minutes. By bus: lines 45, 46, 47 (stop AMC), walk two minutes. By car: get to the AMC driving south along A2 direction Utrecht, take an exit AMC and follow the signs; park your car in one of the visitors parking lots, take the corridor on the first floor to the main building (level 0) get to any of the AMC receptions located at each entry. From there, you will receive directions on how to get to the museum."

Opened in 2014 with a personal visit by the Queen Máxima of the Netherlands— showing that she is not afraid to get her hands dirty—the zoo of tiny things sets out to show how interesting and beautiful the invisible world all around us can be. Sitting in the heart of Amsterdam, the facility features exhibits such as petri dishes filled with artfully grown cultures that show the naturally occurring designs they create, and a “scanner” that shows exactly what is growing on people, and where. The only light in the exhibition comes from the displays themselves. The result is a space that feels clean, but almost dank. There is also a microbiology lab on site that grows and cares for the microbes on display. The lab technicians act as both zookeepers and docents, ready to answer any questions that aren’t answered by the big screen microscopes that show what the little things look like up close. When kids come home from the zoo, they are usually prone to shrieking ad nauseam about their favorite animal. It’s about time they came home screaming the names of bacteria."

Beams of sunlight spill through the windows, bathing the books in a soft glow. A spiral staircase curls in the corner like a metal ribbon, letting bibliophiles and art history buffs wind their way throughout the different levels. The Cuypers Library is a research library in Amsterdam’s famous Rijksmuseum. It is the oldest and largest of its kind in the country and aesthetically astounding. However, despite the streams of tourists that flow through the museum, far too few seem to trickle into its remarkable reading room. The 19th-century library, which has recently been restored, has been collecting content since 1885. Its shelves are stocked with manuscripts bound to entice any art history lover. While browsing its extensive collection, you’ll come across books, journals, and periodicals, as well as catalogues about art auctions, exhibitions, trades, and collections. Following its renovations, the museum opened the library’s reading room to visitors. Tourists, students, and art historians alike are welcome to delve into its rich collection. Tables on the ground floor allow people to hunker down with their research materials, surrounded by the library’s aesthetically astounding walls of books."
27,Oudemanhuispoort,"Amsterdam, Netherlands","An ancient passage filled with stalls selling used books, once frequented by Vincent Van Gogh.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oudemanhuispoort,"Now part of University of Amsterdam’s law faculty, this ancient passage filled with stalls selling used books is filled with many ghosts, from cholera patients to Vincent Van Gogh. If you enter Oudemanhuispoort through the Oudezijds Achterburgwal side, you will get one allusion to this passage’s past. Overhead, chiseled into a pediment, is a set of spectacles referring to old age. Indeed, “Old Man’s House Passage” once acted as part of the Netherlands’ first senior citizen home back in the 18th century. Now part of the University of Amsterdam, it actually has a 400-year-old history that has seen it be home to a convent, a hospital for cholera victims, an arts academy, and a museum that formed the basis for the Rijksmuseum and its famous collection of Rembrandts and Vermeers. Since 1886, the stalls of this covered walkway have been selling second hand prints, sheet music, and books. The stalls are currently run by an older generation of fellows—many with spectacles—who are only too willing to share their knowledge. Perhaps some even have secondhand stories about Vincent van Gogh browsing here for inspiration. For example, it’s been said that it was here that everyone’s favorite earless genius found the Japanese prints that he found so inspiring, changing the course of Western art. Imagine what you might find…"
28,In't Aepjen,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",This historic Amsterdam bar used to accept sailor's monkeys as payment.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/in-t-aepjen,"After Amsterdam was destroyed by fire in 1452, the old city was rebuilt using brick. Of all the old wooden buildings that had made up the historic city, only two survived. One of these premises was an inn, located on the corner of the old Zeedijk (sea dike), near the infamous red light district. Called “In’t Aepjen,” it has provided ales, jenever, food, and lodgings since 1519, and is one of Amsterdam’s oldest bars. “In’t Aepjen” literally means “In the Monkeys,” and refers to a time in the golden age of the Dutch Empire, when sailors returning from such distant colonies as Indonesia, and finding themselves short of guilders, would offer up their newly acquired pets as payment, often literally paying their bills in monkeys. Soon the In’t Aepjen was overrun with so many monkeys that customers began to complain of the fleas. The monkeys were given to a regular customer at the tavern, Gerard Westerman, who kept them in his large garden in the east of the city. Westerman’s animal garden would eventually become Amsterdam’s Artis Zoo, one of Europe’s oldest. Today the venerable old tavern is decorated with monkeys everywhere you look; carved statues, vintage posters, and oil portraits hanging from the bar. You may no longer be able to pay your bar tab with one, but one of the oldest buildings in Amsterdam is still very much “In the Monkeys.”"

Following a multi-million euro refit, the A’DAM Tower was born in early 2016 as one of Amsterdam’s most exciting nightlife and creative hubs, and its first public observation deck. Looming tall over the Amsterdam North skyline, the Skydeck at the top of the 22-floor tower offers a magnificent 360-degree view of Amsterdam’s city center. At the Skydeck you can find the highest swing in Europe. With a safety harness you swing back and forth at a dizzying height of nearly 100 meters above Amsterdam. The easiest way to get there is by taking the ferry to Buiksloterweg (free) at the North side of the train station. To enter the A'DAM Lookout you have to buy a ticket. Costs are 12.50 Euro for adults (12+ years) and 6.50 for children (4-12 years). The swing costs extra (5 Euro)."

The museum features old tools and implements for turning hemp into rope, paper, and clothing, as well as a variety of ancient and not so ancient smoking devices. Visitors can also get a better understanding of the cannabis plant by checking out the indoor cannabis garden located inside the museum. The museum examines hashish, marijuana, and hemp using a variety of media from photography and film to books and paintings, both ancient and modern and the history, and the current use of the cannabis plant is covered in depth. Though the plant is still controversial in many regions of the world, the museum aims to teach visitors about how useful hemp, marijuana, and hash was in past civilizations and how we might use the plant to better our industries and environment of today."
31,Our Lord in the Attic,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",The attic of a four-century-old canal house hides a clandestine church.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/our-lord-in-the-attic,"The canal house at Number 40, Oudezijds Voorburgwal, Amsterdam, looks much like the other Queen Anne-style homes that the old city is famous for. Built as a residential home in 1630, in the heart of the oldest part of Amsterdam and bordering the infamous red light district, this particular steep-gabled building holds a remarkable secret. Making your way through the nearly 400-year-old corridors, kitchens, and bedrooms, there is a narrow and steep staircase that leads to the upper floors. Where, hidden away in the attic, is a magnificently miniature, fully-appointed Catholic church. The clandestine church, known in Dutch as a “schuilkerk,” was secreted away in the attic on purpose due to the persecution of Catholicism in Holland in the 17th century. Unable to hold mass in public, Jan Hartmann converted the attic of his home to a church in 1663. Entrance to the church, known as Our Dear Lord in the Attic or “Ons’ Lieve Heer op Solder,” was gained through a fake door hidden in the living room. This led onto a tiny spiral staircase that would take the faithful Papists into the top reaches of the attic. Whilst nothing on the outside of the home suggests what is hidden inside, the miniature church is an exquisitely appointed place of worship. With seating for about 150 worshippers in narrow gallery seating, the secret church is beautifully decorated in the Dutch classicist style. The marble and gilt altar is lavishly decorated with a painting of the Baptism of Christ by Jacob de Wit, surrounded by pillars made from more marble. The secret church was turned into a museum in 1888, making it the second oldest museum in the city. But this unique treasure is still in use today, with regular services held in the attic, just as they have been for the past 400 years."

Amsterdam Oersoep, which means “primordial sea,” pays tribute to Amsterdam’s famed canals. It’s also a visual narrative that tells the story of how all of Earth’s lifeforms originated from water. Images associated with the Dutch city’s iconic waterways fill the approximately 4,840-square-foot glass mosaic, and there are also Art deco mirrors and chandeliers made from recycled bicycle parts. The floors, which were made with traditional Italian Terrazzo, were designed with patterns that mimic those typically found at archaeological excavations. The artists gave the Beurspassage its dazzling renovation as part of a redevelopment project called Nowadays. The passageway is a fairly popular place among both locals and tourists. It is located between Nieuwendijk and Damrak - look for the Primark store and you will find it."

The theater opened in 1921 and includes not just a film screen but also a stage for live performances and a Wurlitzer organ. The building has recently been overhauled and refurbished. It is considered to be part of the Amsterdam School of Expressionist architecture, but shows strong influence from more austere sub-genres of Art Nouveau, the Craftsman style, and indeed the related and contemporary Art Deco so popular across the pond at that time. Sadly, Tuschinski and his family were taken from Amsterdam to Nazi concetration camps. None survived."
34,The Kruševo Makedonium,"Krusevo, North Macedonia",Space-age monument to an early 20th-century uprising.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mechkin-kamen-abandoned-monument,"In 1903, a group of brave Macedonians charged into battle against the Ottoman Empire, sparking a movement that led to the creation of a free Macedonia. In honor of the uprising, a bizarre space-age monument and memorial complex was constructed 70 years later. If the artist and the surrounding memorial park didn’t state explicitly that the building was in honor of the Ilinden Uprising, it stands to reason that no one would ever make the connection. The Makedonium almost looks like a heart valve, except it’s white and has around 10 massive stained-glass skylights poking out from its circular base. In North Macedonia, it has become a symbol of statehood, even making it onto the national currency on the 10,000 Denari bill. It overlooks the town of Kruševo from over 4,000 feet, which makes it fairly prominent, but that’s where the symbolism ends. There are no statues of soldiers holding a flag or grand statements of statehood. There is only a weird African-cucumber shaped modernist expression of freedom. Maybe that’s the point of the monument, it is looking toward the future, where free expression meets innovation without the stifling influence of a crumbling Turkish empire. There are probably no right answers, but a trip to the Makedonium will at the very least allow visitors to overlook a beautiful and well-preserved medieval town while they scratch their heads in confusion.   It's less than a mile from the center of Kruševo."
35,Kokino Observatory,North Macedonia,"This 3,800-year-old site contains markers used to study the movement of the sun and moon and create a lunar calendar.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kokino-observatory,"The science of observing the sky and measuring time based on its changes is almost as old as civilization itself. Many early  societies had their own calendars, and archaeologists continue to find evidence of this at various sites. In 2001, the ruins of a Bronze Age settlement were found outside the small North Macedonian village of Kokino. Amid the signs of occupation like pieces of vessels and weapons, researchers also discovered giant stones arranged in puzzling patterns, at an elevation of over 3,300 feet. With further study, they identified these as stone markers used to track the patterns of the sun and the moon, making the site an ancient megalithic observatory, dating back nearly 3,800 years. Two platforms, separated by a height of around 62 feet, are located at the center of the observatory’s remains. Four massive stone thrones, facing the direction of the east, make up the lower platform. The higher platform consists of markers carved into malleable andesite rocks, that indicated significant astronomical events like the summer and winter solstices, as well as the spring and autumn equinoxes. While seated on the thrones, particularly the second one, the exact movement of light during these days could be seen. The most powerful member of the community usually took his place on this special seat, and observed the light that streamed through the carved markers, and soaked in the energy of the sun. Rituals based on these solar changes were held at the observatory. Information about the change in seasons was conveyed through a huge fire, visible to people living in surrounding areas. The appearance of this blaze told people when it was time to start planting, ploughing, or harvesting, allowing them to plan their agricultural calendar. Their lunar calendars followed a 19-year cycle, where, for the first 12 years, each year had 12 months—6 summer months, and 6 winter months. The remaining 7 years were divided into 13 months each. Kokino, with its dual function as a scientific and ritual site, is of great interest to archaeoastronomy researchers, who study the sky-based rituals of ancient societies through the lens of anthropology and modern astronomy."
36,Kuklica,"Ketenovo, North Macedonia",Stone pillars and a petrified wedding party in the hills of North Macedonia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kuklica,"Grouped together in a tiny area of just 74 acres, 120 massive stone pillars stand at attention and have stood there for 100,000 years. Or, depending on your beliefs, since a local woman cursed her wedding party when her husband chose a different bride. According to local lore, a man was struggling to choose between two women. Not able to make up his mind, he figured he would marry both on the same day and not tell the other. Unluckily for him, during his morning wedding the second wife came to check out the scene and was horrified watching her husband’s double-crossing nuptials. In a rage, she cursed the whole wedding party and they turned to stone where they stood and created Kuklica. Whether you believe the legend or not, the area has a been described as having a somewhat mystic aura, and the stone formations, that were actually created by volcanic rocks and uneven erosion, have managed to draw in visitors for decades. Getting to Kuklica is not an easy task and there are few signs marking the way. The easiest way to find the field of pillars is by asking a local or hiring a tour guide to lead you to the petrified wedding party."
37,Little Pioneers Youth Camp,North Macedonia,An abandoned resort in North Macedonia is a relic from the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/titos-pioneers-youth-camp,"“Little Pioneers, we are a proper army. Like the green grass, we grow daily. Death to fascism, freedom to the people. My mum will call me her little Pioneer.” ― Song lyrics featured in Little Pioneers textbooks During Yugoslavia’s Communist era from 1945 to 1992, many forms of samoupravljanje (self-governing) were defined by the constitution and encouraged by the state. A widely used option was SIZ, or Samoupravne Interesne Zajednice (Self-governed Interest Communities), which were founded and run by a group of self-organized people. The SIZ would decide how they want to channel the money they obtained (mostly through collective work efforts and direct donations from its members). Often the money would be used to fund something useful for the whole community. Many hotels, summer camps, and holiday resorts were built through the SIZ system. The Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia alone, while being one of the smaller Yugoslav republics, had five resorts dedicated to children’s activities. Tito’s Pioneers, named for Josip Broz Tito, a communist revolutionary and later president of Yugoslavia, was the largest among them. It covered an area of almost four square miles on the shore of Dojran Lake, near Николиќ (Nikolikj), a small village right next to Greece (without an official border crossing). The main town of Дојран (Dojran) is about 15 kilometers away, so Nikolikj stays relatively calm and unfrequented. Children from all over Yugoslavia were given the chance to stay for free in the avant-garde buildings of the idyllic resort. The complex rises out of the uncontaminated nature with harsh lines and raw material design typical for the architecture of that period. The facade clearly reveals the functions of the interior space, alternating between solid and transparent surfaces. The only decorations are the concrete monocle-shaped windows that offer each room a slightly different view from the round frames. Five identical arrow-shaped buildings that almost touch each other comprise the compound. Each unit has two wings of rooms and a central communal area. The camp was abandoned in the 1990s during the wars in Yugoslavia, but the locals of Nikolikj village still remember the period they call the “golden era,” when more than 300 locals were employed by the camp. Today it sits in ruins, nature slowly covering the place up. The complex is not guarded or secured in any way, so it is free and easy to access, but also potentially dangerous. Most of the windows are broken, which gives entrance to explore the interior. Everything that could be taken is already gone, with only the basic structure remaining. The Republic of Macedonia tried to auction off all the SIZ resorts in 2015, but the Little Pioneers Youth Camp didn’t have any takers.  It's completely abandoned and Nikolich is a very small village literally on the end of the road. The best option is to rent a car. Hitch-hiking might be an alternative because it's not far away from the Star Dojran, the main town on the lake."
38,Skopje Hydrometeorological Service Building,"Skopje, North Macedonia",A solar-powered primary school inspires hope and experimentation in a country ripe for energy innovation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skopje-hydrometeorological-institute,"As debate and concern over carbon emissions increases around the world, it may in fact be smaller nations who are in the best position to transition from burning fossil fuels to alternative energy sources. Countries like North Macedonia are experimenting with widely distributed solar power, and initiating robust tax and economic incentives to support these efforts. At the Hydrometeorological Service Institute, part of a primary school in Skopje, North Macedonia, the roof is covered with solar panels in one of the first efforts to create a large-scale building with complex needs completely self-sufficient when it comes to energy. Massive government programs aren’t the goal of this experiment and others like it in North Macedonia. Rather, they, combined with hearty tax breaks for those who follow suit, are meant to be a proof of concept for individualized sustainability efforts on the small-scale. Homeowners all over the country struggle with obtaining heat and electricity, and using solar panels to supply part or all of that electricity would be a huge benefit to the individuals living there leading to a more sustainable North Macedonia overall. That’s a lot of hope to pin on one instance of solar-powered innovation, but if the Hydrometeorological Service is right about the impact of their program, it could eventually take North Macedonia past the wealthiest of nations in terms of per-capita sustainability."
39,Skopje Fortress,"Skopje, North Macedonia",This fortress dates back to the 6th century and is also the site of a controversial abandoned restoration project.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skopje-fortress,"Different iterations of the Skopje Kale (Kale being the Turkish word for fortress) have existed on this site since the 6th century. The fortress is located at the highest point of the city, overlooking the still waters of the Vardar River. The first fortress is thought to have been constructed during the reign of Emperor Justinian I. It was built from materials taken from the Roman city of Skupi after the city was destroyed by a massive earthquake in 518. However, very little is known about the early life of the fortress or what life was like inside the fortress or its garrison. Construction work continued on the fortress throughout the 10th and 11th centuries over the Byzantine remains. In 1346, while at the fortress Stefan Dušan crowned himself emperor, and appointed Skopje as the new capital of the Serbian Empire. Sometime during Ottoman rule, the fort fell into a state of neglect and was left completely empty. During the 19th century, warehouses, arsenals, a military hospital, and prison were discovered inside the fortress. The fortress was greatly damaged during another earthquake in 1963, which left most of the defensive towers and buildings in rubbles. In September 2010, the southwestern wall was restored. The completion of this work coincided with Macedonia’s Independence Day. During an excavation of the fortress, the foundation of a 13th-century church was discovered within the fortress. A project was announced to restore the ruins as a church/museum. Albanian groups belonging to the Democratic Union for Integration claimed that the site contained artifacts relating to their Illyrian ancestry, leading to a dispute over rights to the area and violent outbreaks. The project was eventually abandoned. Today many unfinished, now almost ruinous, building projects can be seen scattered across the fortress complex.  The fortress is located up a steep incline. There are many steps and areas of uneven ground throughout the complex."
40,Abandoned Hotel Evropa,"Oteshevo, North Macedonia",It's unclear what caused the fire that led to this opulent hotel's demise.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-hotel-evropa,"Although Lake Ohrid receives the lion’s share of tourists in North Macedonia, Lake Prespa is a stone’s throw away, and it packs some historical sites for those who are willing to go off the beaten path. Marshal Tito was quite fond of Prespa Lake, which was the place where the borders of Southeast Europe were drawn in the aftermath of World War II. These were the borders that remained in place until the end of the Cold War. If those spomenik monuments scattered throughout the Balkans can be read as a sign of unrelenting optimism, Hotel Evropa can be seen as their post-communist counterpart. Following the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the pacification of the newly-born countries (circa 1992), optimism was in the air. It was a time of new opportunities and hope for a prosperous future. The sheer size and architectural boldness of Hotel Evropa epitomize this sense of rebirth. Its location further corroborates this idea: far from the touristy route and back to where history was made. The two angular arms forming the gate to the hotel epitomize the communist minimalism characteristic of spomenik monuments. The two arms are joined by a banner that still reads, ever so faintly, “Hotel Evropa.” Vegetation encroaches on the short road leading from the gate to the hotel, which has been neglected for years. There are uncertainties around the events that led to the hotel’s abandonment in 2005. What is certain is that a massive fire broke out in the kitchen. What is not clear is what caused the fire. Three hypotheses exist: Frying pans got overheated and caught fire; The electrical circuitry failed and a spark started the fire; The fire was started deliberately in order to defraud the insurance company. No one hypothesis is more credible than the others. Shortly after the fire, the hotel was abandoned and has been vandalized since then. Shattered glass and graffiti are ubiquitous. On the ground floor is the ballroom, which is easily recognizable by the number of smashed mirrors mounted on walls and pillars. A derelict bowling alley can be found in the basement. The upper floors can be reached through the main staircase, which is still in good shape. The upper rooms definitely commanded the best view of the lake, and they still do, but nowadays, what is really striking is the view of vegetation slowly but surely taking over the balconies on the lower floors. There are rumors that developers are set to demolish the hotel to make room for something snazzier, but in the meantime, Hotel Evropa is still there for those who are willing to dare to visit it."

Fortunately, the church is located in all of these entities. Movrovo village is on the shore of Movrovo Lake, along Mavrovo Valley, which is part of Mavrovo National Park. Mavrovo village is perched on the slopes of the Bistra Mountains overlooking Mavrovo Lake, an artificial body of water that was created in 1947 by damming the Mavrovo River. Once water filled the basin, some buildings were submerged. Only one of these buildings is still standing: St Nicholas Church. Although it’s roofless, the sturdy stone walls of St Nicholas Church have withstood the test of time. A solitary image of St Nicholas sits in the middle of the iconostasis behind the altar table. Two stands for votive candles are placed in front of the altar, and a couple of columns rest obliquely against the walls. The floor has significant dips and swells caused by years of flooding and exposure to the elements. There are no other items to speak of inside the church, except some random construction tools. A note to the hopefuls: the church is not always submerged. It depends on the amount of rainfall. In fact, the church has remained above the water level from 2019 to the present day. Even though it is not as scenic, an advantage of visiting the site when the church is not submerged is that one can enter the premise. The re-emergence of St. Nicholas Church after the flooding is seen by some believers as a sign that God is protecting the site."
43,Toše Proeski Memorial House,"Krusheva, North Macedonia",The cross-shaped memorial is filled with kitschy tributes to the late pop star.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tose-proeski-memorial-house,"If there’s one thing the Albanians, Macedonians, Roma, Aromanians, and other citizens of North Macedonia share, it’s the admiration they have for Toše Proeski, or at the very least, the sorrow caused by his early tragic death. Proeski, born 1981 in Krushevo to Aromanian parents, was a talented singer who enjoyed considerable success and fame across the Balkans with his numerous pop music hits. But the attention given to him skyrocketed after his untimely death in a car accident. Since he died, a sort of a Proeski-cult was created across the former Yugoslavia, celebrating not only his singing skills, but also his benevolent personality. It is no exaggeration to say that the Toše Proeski Memorial House in Kruševo is the epicenter of this “cult.” If Tošeism was a religion, this would be its cathedral. The building is appropriately shaped like a cross, inspired by the fact that Proeski was a believer. The shape of the building, however, is the least peculiar thing about it. The lonely guard, ticket vendor, and bartender give the whole place a Lynchesque vibe, but what really makes this place worth the visit is the collection. Somebody somehow managed to collect everything and anything related to Proeski’s life and put it all in one place in his hometown. And that means literally everything—cheap China-produced memorabilia, all of his medals and awards, all of his school diplomas, tons of fan mail, a lot of the objects he used to own (including a synthesizer, a motorbike, and a bicycle), and a huge number of photos of him. You’ll also spot several life-sized wax statues of questionable quality and his most famous quote (“I love you all”) printed in relief all over the walls of the memorial.  Free parking is available. Photos are not allowed inside the memorial."
44,Museum of Tobacco,"Prilep, North Macedonia",Thousands of objects tell the story of a city famous for its tobacco.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-tobacco,"The city of Prilep in North Macedonia has been famous for its tobacco production for 500 years. Fittingly, it is now home to one of the largest tobacco museums in the world. Formed in 1973, the collection includes more than 2,500 objects related to tobacco. Many of the items are quite valuable and have an interesting backstory, such as the chibouk belonging to Russian Tsar Nikolai Romanov, Queen Anna of Austria’s tobacco pipe, and various cigarette cases and other smoking artifacts that belonged to European royals.  Opening hours are irregular; it's best to contact the museum to schedule a visit in advance."
45,Xhamia e Larme,"Tetovo, North Macedonia",Artists made this mosque into a marvel of Ottoman baroque architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/xhamia-e-larme,"The exterior of Xhamia e Larme (Painted Mosque) mosque is adorned with illustrated, colorful rectangles that look like giant, artisanal playing cards, and the interior is no less intricate. According to an inscription above the main entrance to the mosque, the original Xhamia e Larme mosque was built in 1485, but it was destroyed in 1689 by a fire during a battle with Austrian forces. A newer version of Xhamia e Larme was built in 1833 under the aegis of Abdurrahman Pasha. Pasha expanded the mosque into a 10 meter-by-10 meter square. Out of respect for the minaret’s original orientation, builders placed the tower halfway through one of the structure’s side walls, rather than in the corner of the building as is custom. Thirty stained glass windows ring the mosque in an almost-symmetrical formation, letting colorful sunlight into the room and projecting patterns on the interior walls. To make the mosque appear symmetrical, artists painted a window on the wall where the minaret interrupts the place of an actual window. Given its age and architecture, Xhamia e Larme would have been remarkable in its own right, but the decorations make it a place of immense cultural and artistic value. Abdurrahman Pasha called on artists from Debar (Dibra in Albanian) to decorate both the interior and the exterior of the mosque. On the exterior walls between the wooden windows, they tastefully inserted intricate floral and geometric patterns divided into panes. A large six-point star stands out on the ceiling of the porch. The interior decorations are simply stunning. Floral and geometric motifs dominate, but the corbeled dome and the upper section of the walls also boast depictions of famous urban landscapes and twelve medallions with the exquisite, calligraphic names of twelve prophets.  Each front-facing upper window has an internal semi-circular balcony whose design is enhanced by rich and colorful decorations. At the back of Xhamia e Larme is a graveyard with ancient tombs.  The oldest ones date back to the 16th century, and they belong to Hurshide and Mensure, daughters of an Anatolian Pasha."
46,Memorial House of Mother Teresa,"Skopje, North Macedonia","In the hometown of the Catholic saint and Nobel Peace Prize winner, a memorial dedicated to her legacy.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/memorial-house-of-mother-teresa,"Born in Skopje in 1910, Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu—who would go on to become Mother Teresa—became part of the Sisters of Loreto when she was 18 years old. Soon after joining this order, she was sent to India, where she took the vows as a nun in 1931. During this time, she was teaching geography and history at St. Mary’s High School in Calcutta. Visits to the slums made an impact on her, and in 1948, Mother Teresa received permission to start working with the most indigent people in Calcutta. The nature of the organization that Mother Teresa headed underwent different changes through the years, but the latest and most well-known is the Missionaries of Charity.  For the work she did, she won international recognition including the Noble Peace Prize in 1979.  Mother Teresa died in Calcutta in 1997, and the Holy See made her a saint in 2017 (following a process not entirely devoid of controversy). Skopje municipality decided to pay homage to Mother Teresa, and in January 2009, it unveiled the Memorial House of Mother Teresa. This remarkable structure was not built where Mother Teresa was born or lived, but at the location where she was baptized. The design of the house is credited to a well-known architect by the name of Vangel Božinovski, and it is said to have been inspired by Mother Teresa’s birthplace with, understandably, a great deal of artistic liberty. The memorial house consists of an amphitheater in the basement, a museum on the first floor, and a chapel on the top floor. The amphitheater is equipped with multimedia devices and it is used for special events. Among other articles, the museum on the first floor displays handwritten and printed documents signed by Mother Teresa, a number of objects that pinpoint different times of her eventful life, photographs of Mother Teresa with prominent figures, and life-size statues of her likeness. The mortal remains of Mother Teresa are also kept in this location.  The chapel is enclosed by glass panes framed by metal filigree.  It incorporates elements of Macedonian traditional craftsmanship but with a distinctive futuristic flare. The portrait of Mother Teresa dominates the altar. Honorary masses are held to commemorate the life and work of Mother Teresa. This memorial house has been controversial on several accounts. It is hard, for example, to justify spending 2 million Euros to build a memorial to someone who preached poverty all her life. The design of the building is also questionable, as it bears no correlation with the life of Mother Teresa. Finally, there are more basic questions regarding the very existence of a memorial to immortalize Mother Teresa, a figure that is not appreciated universally. It can be argued that her insistence on poverty and suffering has impacted negatively on hospitals following her approach, leading to deficiency in hygiene and parsimonious use of medicines, especially analgesics."
47,Kosturnica (Ossuary Monument),"Veles, North Macedonia",This elegant monument to those who fought against fascism is inspired by the shape of the poppy flower.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ossuary-monument-kosturnica,"The Ossuary Monument (Kosturnica) pays homage to the partisans from Veles who fought against the fascist forces from Germany and Bulgaria in World War II. It consists of a concrete monument inspired by an upside-down poppy flower. Half of this structure is indoors, and it houses a series of mosaics and smaller monuments. Underneath the monument is a crypt with the remains of 87 partisans. The credits for the design of this ossuary monument go to Ljubomir Denkoviḱ and Savo Subotin. Its construction began in 1976 and continued for three years, and the monument was eventually unveiled on 11 October 1979. As a result of the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, this structure suffered years of neglect and vandalism. The bronze plaques that adorned the open-air section of the monument were stolen, and graffiti started appearing. Fortunately, the indoor section was not broken into, and the mosaics and the smaller statue survived unscathed. The situation started improving in the 2010s, when funds were allocated to the renovation of the ossuary monument. As of 2022, four of the six original bronze plaques have been recovered and returned to their rightful place.  The monument has been repainted, and the graffiti was covered, but the structure does show signs of aging."
48,Freedom Monument,"Kočani, North Macedonia",A mosaic monument that commemorates the historical struggles of the people of North Macedonia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/freedom-monument-north-macedonia,"Whenever a monument is dedicated to freedom, this term has to be unpacked.  Without delving too deep into semantics, freedom can personal or collective, and it can be intended as freedom to do something, or freedom from something undesirable.  The Freedom Monument in Kočani refers to the struggle of the local people against outside aggressors, focussing specifically on the tumultuous events that took place during the 20th century. During the early 1970s, the people of Kočani started collecting funds for the construction of a spomenik (monument or memorial).  Following a public contest, a design created by Gligor Čemerski and Radovan Rađenović was selected. Construction began in 1975 and lasted two years, but the official unveiling of the spomenik did not happen until 1981, coinciding with the anniversary of the foundation of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Built on top of a hill overlooking the whole of Kočani and beyond, the Freedom Monument consists of several irregular concrete panes forming an amphitheater. It showcases mosaics recalling key historical events underlining the struggle that Macedonians faced in claiming sovereignty and independence. The first event that the Freedom Monument immortalizes is the 1903 Ilinden Uprising against the Ottoman Empire. This is recalled through the image of an insurgent flying high the rebel flag that reads “Freedom or Death” in Cyrillic characters. The most prominent mosaic stands high at the center of the panes, and it depicts the “Lady of Freedom,” a female figure holding red and blue ribbons.  Most panes are placed horizontally, with the exception of two mounted on pillars. The style of the mosaics is abstract, calling to mind the cubist paintings of Pablo Picasso. Since its unveiling, Freedom Monument has been an important point of reference for the people of Kočani. However, the demise of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia translated into years of neglect for the Freedom Monument. As of 2022, visiting the monument felt like visiting an abandoned public space: the tiles of the mosaics were damaged, unsightly graffiti covered sections of the monument, and the concrete panes were crumbling."
49,Trolltunga,"Odda, Norway","Walk 2,300 feet above the ground on the ""Troll's Tongue.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trolltunga,"Trolltunga is a spectacular example of the geological oddities that dot the Norwegian landscape. The fittingly named “Troll’s Tongue” sticks out of a vertical mountainside above a 700 meter (about 2,300 feet) drop. The scenic cliff offers a magnificent view of lake Ringedalsvatnet in Skjeggedal. It was made thousands of years ago by water from a glacier freezing off part of the rock. Keep an eye on your feet as there’s no safety rail here. You can take a funicular up part of the way, though it isn’t always functioning. Otherwise, it is roughly an 8 to 10-hour hike roundtrip through mountains and waterfalls to the ledge. In recent years, this spot has become more popular with travelers looking for that perfect Instagram shot. If waiting in line to take a photo isn’t to your liking, this might no longer be a good destination for you.  You can also get to Skjeggedal by public transport: take bus #995 from Odda. Guided tours are also available. The recommended season to Trolltunga is from June 15 to September 15. If you aren’t going during the summer, pay attention to these dates: September 16 to October 28, as recommended with a guide; October 29 to February 16 is not recommended because it's highly dangerous; February 17 to June 14 are recommended with guide to snowshoe. All the hikes in Norway are at your own risk. As such, use appropriate clothing for hiking. Bring food, water, maps, and a first aid kit. There is no cellphone coverage in certain areas."
50,Atlantic Road,"Averøy, Norway",A serpentine highway twists and turns over the treacherous Norwegian Sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atlantic-road,"The Atlantic Road, known as Atlanterhavsveien in Norwegian, is just about the most scenic route one could imagine. The curvy road dips and arches over the brutal waves of the Norwegian Sea that often crash over the pavement during storms, and was subjected to 12 hurricanes during construction. A 5.2-mile (8,274-meter long) segment of County Road 64 in Norway, it consists of several causeways, seven bridges, and four viewpoints to take in the scenic views. The road winds over an entire archipelago in the Norwegian Sea, linking the tiny islands and connecting the communes of Eide and Averoy in the county of Møre og Romsdal. Along with the practical reason for the road (to unify Norway) the swooping stretch is also a popular fishing spot; one of the bridges is specifically designed for it. Tourists and locals alike can go cod fishing on the designated side of the highway. In the 20th Century, the route was originally envisioned as a railway, but the plans never managed to materialize. Schematics and planning for a road began developing in the 1970s, but construction didn’t start until August 1, 1983. After being hit by one hurricane after another (for a total of 12!) and costing 122 million Norwegian Krone, the bridge was finally opened on July 7, 1989. Even though it costed a fortune, now the road is toll free. Driving along the Atlantic Road is like teetering on the edge of the sea. The road’s roller coaster-feel, curvy bridges, and phenomenal views have made it a favorite of road trippers and motorcyclists. It was also designated a Cultural Heritage Site, is considered a National Tourist Route, and has been recognized as the Norwegian Construction of the Century."
51,Uredd Rest Area (Ureddplassen),"Gildeskål, Norway",Norway has built what may be the world's most beautiful public toilet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/uredd-rest-area-ureddplassen,"Norway’s newest landmark is a place of absurd beauty. The redesigned rest area, situated along a section of the Norwegian Scenic Route, overlooks stunning views of the fjords and the open sea, and is a popular spot for visitors and locals to watch the northern lights in winter and the midnight sun in summer. Now this picturesque place is quickly gaining a stranger kind of fame, for being home to what may be the most beautiful public toilet the world over. As part of a project to enhance Norway’s scenic highways with innovative architecture, a sleek viewing area with marble benches and amphitheater steps leading down to the water was built along the roadside. And next to them, a striking, wave-shaped public restroom. Made of frosted glass and concrete, in quintessential minimalist design, the structure seems to glow in the dark as the glass is lit at night. In the daytime, the facility offers just about the most breathtaking view you could hope to enjoy while relieving yourself. The rest area gets its name from the World War II memorial located at the site. The monument commemorates the Norwegian “Uredd” submarine (meaning “fearless”) that sank during the war, causing 42 sailors to lose their lives.  Uredd Rest Area is wheelchair accessible."
52,Kjeragbolten,"Forsand, Norway",This giant boulder is pinched over a 1000-meter abyss by two mountains.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kjeragbolten,"Hidden in the Norwegian mountains, Kjeragbolten is a place that looks like something from Middle Earth. Kjeragbolten is a boulder wedged in a mountain crevasse by the edge of the Kjerag mountain in Lysefjord, near Stavanger. You might have seen it in one of the “Where the Hell is Matt” videos, which feature a man doing a crazy dance in dozens of locations around the world. The boulder itself is a five-cubic-meter large block of stone suspended above 984-meter deep abyss. Despite its impressive appearance, it is easily accessible on foot without any special equipment. The whole of Kjerag mountain is a popular hiking area, and Kjeragbolten is a favorite photo spot. Apparently, for some the thrill of standing on a boulder suspended between two cliffs isn’t quite enough, as Kjeragbolten has become a very popular spot for base jumpers to use when launching themselves into the air. The hike up can be somewhat challenging for non-experienced hikers. It is not appropriate for small children. Good hiking shoes/boots are recommended. Also, bring plenty of water and sunscreen, as there are no trees to shelter under on the mountains.  Take E39 out of Stavanger and head for Ålgård. After passing Ålgård turn left to Sirdalen via Oltedal, Dirdal and Byrkjedal (route 45). At the toll station at Øvstabø turn left for Sinnes, pass Fidjeland and turn left again for Lysebotn. There are also buses running from Stavanger to Øygardstøl operated by Tide Reiser. The hike is open from May to October/November and it’s recommended to go during the summer (from June to September)."
53,Viking Ship Museum,"Oslo, Norway",Home to three historic ships from the age of Vikings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/viking-ship-museum,"In 1903 a farmer named Knut Rom made an extraordinary discovery on his property: a complete ship from the Viking era, along with two skeletons and a treasure trove of grave goods. The ship Rom discovered became known as the Oseberg Ship, and it is the centerpiece of the Viking Museum in Oslo. The Oseberg Ship is 21.5 meter long oak “karv” type ship, a slightly smaller than average, early ship style. The bow and stern are richly decorated with carvings of interlocking beasts. Almost as exciting as the discovery of such a complete and beautiful ship, the grave goods contained some very mysterious items. The so-called “Buddha Bucket” is the most famous mystery. Decorating the base of the handles on this otherwise unremarkable bucket, two small brass figures seated in the Lotus position look like nothing more than tiny, completely out of place, Buddhas. Although it is possible that Vikings did have contact with Asian cultures (and in fact another Buddha figure is on display at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm) researchers consider it more likely a result of coincidental hodge-podge of styles from their many Northern European contacts. In 1904, at the time of the excavation of this remarkable find, there was no room to house it in the existing historical museum. In fact, two other ships, the Tune Ship and the Gokstad Ship, were also in need of a home. The first designs for the Viking Museum were drawn up in 1914, but it was not until 1957 that it finally opened its doors. The Oseberg, Tune, and Gokstad Ships are all now housed inside the museum. All of the ships were built between the years 800 and 900, the height of the Viking Age. The first ship discovered was the Tune Ship in 1867, but it is not in as good condition as the Oseberg or the Gokstad. The Gokstad Ship was discovered in 1880 in a burial mound along with two male skeletons, and is displayed with a reconstructed burial chamber. The Gokstad has also had new life in the form of replicas, one of which successfully crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 1893 to be exhibited at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. There is another Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark. Update as of January 2022: The museum is currently closed for renovations. Update as of June 2022: Their website states that they will reopen as the Museum of the Viking Age in 2026."
54,Urnes Stave Church,"Luster, Norway",An intricately carved Viking church overlooks a glistening fjord.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/urnes-stave-church,"A cliffside Norwegian village is home to an old Viking church that has looked over the neighboring fjord for going on 900 years. Though this building has stood since around the year 1130, archaeological excavations indicate there were at least three buildings there before the church that stands today. Scholars believe church ground has been a site of Christian worship at least since the early 11th century. The church boasts an artistic style unique to Scandinavia in the 11th and 12th centuries. The so-called “Urnes style” incorporates animal figures into the delicate, winding lines of traditional Viking carving. This is no museum piece though. The church has been in use from the time it was built, with architectural updates along the centuries. It has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The carvings on the church lend insight to the cosmology of medieval Scandinavian Christians, who combined Norse and Christian mythology. The most notable and mysterious carving in the church is on the northern wall. It depicts a snake-like creature being eaten by a four-footed animal. Christian scholars assert that this is a battle between Satan and Christ, each representing evil and good, respectively. Norse mythologists claim it is a representation of the end of the world, with the dragon Níðhöggr consuming the roots of the world tree. The church continues to draw pilgrims who come to behold its religious and historic significance, as well as its aesthetic beauty. It is situated on a verdant promontory that overlooks the Lustrafjord, one of Norway’s greatest bodies of water."
55,Preikestolen,"Strand, Norway","This ""preacher's pulpit"" once used for pagan ritual, is home to a new, and dangerous ritual.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/preikestolen,"When the glaciers carved Norway out of the living rock, the ice giants must have created Preikestolen with BASE jumpers in mind. This unusually shaped, massive rectangular cliff rises 604m above Lysefjorden. The name Preikestolen translates to Preacher’s Pulpit or Pulpit Rock. It is situated almost at exactly the opposite side of the fjord from another well known natural oddity Kjeragbolten rock, and in close proximity to the city of Stavanger. The top of the cliff is almost a perfect square, 25m by 25m wide, and nearly flat, which makes it a perfect platform for BASE jumping. In ancient times the cliff might have been used in pagan religious ceremonies, perhaps as a place of sacrifice. Preikestolen is also a favorite hiking destination. The hiking trip from the closest parking place takes about two hours. The trail starts at 270 meters above sea level and climbs to 604 meters. The total elevation difference of only 334m is a bit misleading as the path climbs up and descends numerous ridges. Still, it is comfortable hiking experience not requiring any special skills and preparations. With almost 300,000 visitors each year it can become a bit too crowded at times. There is a ferry from Stavanger to Tau and then a bus from Tau to the Preikestolen operated by Tide Reiser. You can get the ferry ticket on the pier and bus once you crossed the lake, but it's highly recommend to book everything in advance. The hike can be done the during the whole year, but it’s advised to do from April to October. The best time is during the summer though."

Sixteen feet below sea level, diners can enjoy local delicacies while watching fish swim on the other side of a panoramic window. It’s not the first time Snøhetta, the architecture firm behind Under, has created something spectacular. They also designed the iconic Oslo Opera House. But constructing a restaurant that could be submerged in the sea posed new challenges. One of the most time-consuming parts of the process was ensuring the building could withstand its harsh ocean environment. The restaurant would need to brave waves, storms, and, of course, constant water pressure. From the outside, Under looks like a container that fell off a truck and slid into the water. But after visitors walk inside and descend the stairs, they’ll enter a whole new world. In addition to the underwater view, there is a fixed seasonal tasting menu that features foods from the surrounding area, including fish, seabirds, wild sheep, and plants such as sea kale and arrowgrass.  Be warned: There is a long waiting list to dine at Under. You can check availability and make reservations on the restaurant's website."
57,Nigardsbreen Ice Cave,"Luster, Norway",A stunning silver lining to global warming's gloomy cloud.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nigardsbreen-ice-cave,"Though the Jostedal glacier had bucked the trend by advancing throughout much of the last decade, the glacier’s winning streak came to an end in 2006 when it began retreating alongside its icy brethren. Soon after, in the autumn of 2007, researchers discovered a spectacularly large, pristine ice cave beneath the Nigardsbreen region of Norway’s Jostedal Glacier National Park. What they found when crawling through the cave’s five-meter opening was so magnificent that one scientist went so far as to beatify the grotto by calling it an “ice cathedral.” Once inside, the cavernous dome measures up to eight meters in height, 30 meters deep and 20 meters wide. Its water and ice formations appear in deep crystalline blues, while the ceiling is punctuated by large icicles. Due to the literally fluid nature of the ice, the cave’s appearance is constantly changing. Experts have attributed its unparalleled formation as an bi-product of glacial melting resulting from a steadily warming climate. Huge amounts of water melting from the glacier continue to erode the its innermost surfaces. The lagoon within the grotto simultaneously accumulates the runoff, while encouraging further melting as it ever-so-slightly warms the air trapped within the cave. Despite its location on one of the most easily accessible glaciers on Earth, the Nigardsbreen grotto is not to be entered by the general public without a guide. This is particularly the case throughout the summer months when warm temperatures and an active melting cycle dramatically increase the likelihood of the cave’s collapse. There are access roads to the park from many of the surrounding valleys, including Jostedalen, Veitastrond, Fjærland, Stardalen, Oldedalen and Lodalen. Exit Rv55 Sognefjellet Road at Gaupne and go north on Rv604. From late June to early September, No 160 (Jostedalsbrebussen) runs between Sogndal and the base of Nigardsbreen glacier. Check schedule for departure and arrival times. A ferry shuttles visitors across the lagoon to the glacier face from mid-June to August. Accommodation can be found at camp sites, guest houses and hotels in the valleys outside the park. Cabins within the park are accessed by foot (a few hours hike) from the main roads."
58,Lofoten Islands,"Røst, Norway",The convergence of two currents makes this a surprisingly pleasant getaway in the Arctic Circle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lofoten-islands,"When you think about the northern lines of latitude known as the Arctic Circle, you probably imagine an inhospitable alien world, probably set in mid-winter’s freezing cold and unbearable darkness. Although the darkness is correct, the temperatures in the Lofoten Islands of Norway defy convention. Despite their location, the Lofoten Islands, tucked inside the Arctic Circle, rarely dip below freezing. Due to a convergence of the Gulf Stream with two underwater currents, the North Atlantic Current and the Norwegian Current, the weather in Lofoten remains anomalously warm. Two cities in Lofoten, Røst and Værøy, have average temperatures above freezing for the entire year. Although the mountains near Lofoten often get snow and weather can be unpredictable, Lofoten remains one of the world’s largest elevated temperature anomalies considering its position in the Arctic."
59,Vigeland Sculpture Park,"Oslo, Norway","One man's exploration of the human form, including the bizarre and delightful ""Man Attacked by Babies.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vigeland-sculpture-park,"The human form is deeply embedded into the natural pattern-recognition mechanism of our brains. We have an instinctual knowledge of body and face proportions and, as a consequence, human forms remain deeply ingrained in our art and sense of aesthetics. Vigeland Sculpture Park is a result of one man’s artistic obsession and a lifetime of work dedicated to exactly that: the human form. The park contains 212 bronze and granite sculptures created by Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland. He worked over a period of almost 20 years, from 1924 to 1943, and donated his sculptures to the city of Oslo. The sculptures range in topic from representation of humans in everyday situations, such as walking, sitting, holding hands, to more symbolic subjects such as “Man Attacked by Babies,” to highly abstract works, which represent the centerpiece of the complex. Among the highlights of the park are “The Fountain,” which was originally designed to stand in front of the Norwegian Parliament. This location, however, proved controversial. The sculpture consists of 60 individual bronze reliefs representing the circle of life, with sculptures of children, teenagers, old men, and skeletons. “The Monolith” is the focal point of the park. It is a 14.12-meter high, highly symbolic sculpture consisting of 121 intertwined human figures, meant to represent the human desire to reach out to the divine. The carving of this monolith took over 14 years and involved work by the artist himself as well as 3 other stone carvers. In addition, 36 sculptural groups reside on the plateau around the monolith. “The Wheel of Life” is a sundial positioned at the very end of an 850-meter axis. Thematically, it continues the journey-of-life motive prevalent in the rest of the park. It is represents eternity, with four human figures and a baby locked in a circle, floating in harmony. Vigeland continued to work on the park until the end of his life. Since its opening to the public in 1940, the park has become a favorite picnic area for the citizens of Oslo.  Bus 20 and tram 12 to the Vigeland Park. All westbound lines (T-bane) to Majorstuen station. By car, follow Ring 2 to Majorstuen, Kirkeveien."
60,Fantoft Stave Church,"Bergen, Norway",The burning of this 12th-century church kicked off a campaign of Norwegian Black Metal terror.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fantoft-stave-church,"Located in the Fana borough in Bergen, Norway, is a blackened stave church that is nearly a millennium old. Or it would be nearly that age today if it hadn’t been destroyed (most likely) by Black Metal musician and arsonist, Varg Vikernes, in 1992. The original Fantoft Stave Church was built around 1150 in Fortun, a small village about 183 miles northeast of Bergen. Like other stave churches with their characteristic soaring vertical design, its fully wooden construction was supported only by a foundation made of stones. The structure’s planks, columns, and supports were dovetailed or pegged together—no glue or nails necessary. Hundreds of these peculiarly Norwegian stave churches were built in the 12th and 13th centuries, but by the 19th century there were only a few dozen left.  Though Fantoft Stave Church was one of the lucky few left standing, the hard economic conditions in Norway had left the church in disrepair. Local villagers began to remove salvageable pieces for their farms — including the baptismal font, which was repurposed as a trough for livestock. The structure was slated for demolition until a Bergen businessman, Fredrik Georg Gade, bought it and had it moved piece by piece to Fantoft, where it was reconstructed. Eventually, the church was listed as a historic site. That is, of course, until it was burned to the ground in 1992, the first in a spate of church fires set by Norway’s emerging Black Metal scene that ultimately consumed 22 stave churches. Vikernes, AKA Count Grishnackh, was later convicted of burning four churches, but was found not guilty in the case of the Fantoft Stave Church. Suspicion continued to swirl around Vikernes, however, as he had bragged to a journalist in 1993 that the Fantoft fire was the work of the Black Metal community, rather than lightning or electrical failure (as had initially been believed), and had used a photograph of the burnt church on his 1993 EP release, Aske (Norwegian for ashes), for his one-man band, Burzum. Vikernes stated that the church-burning campaign was part of a war Black Metal was waging on Christianity and Norwegian society. The reconstruction that stands in its place today was completed in 1997 and includes the original crucifix, which survived the fire. While it is no longer a designated historical building, it is a faithful representation of this unique, centuries-old church style built during the overlap of traditional Norse mythology and new-fangled Christianity in Norway. Update as of July 2021: The church is closed for the 2021 summer season."
61,Flåmsbana (Flåm Railway),"Flåm, Norway","One of the most breathtaking railways in Europe also takes one of the steepest climbs, from fjord to mountain plateau.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/flamsbana-flam-railway,"Europe’s steepest non-funicular railway is in southern Norway, covering 10 miles from the high plateau of Myrdal to the tiny fjord-side town of Flåm. The historic Flåm Railway (Flåmsbana in Norwegian) passes through wide valley vistas and alongside dramatic waterfalls, and chugs at a leisurely pace through 20 tunnels, some with “windows” carved in the side so passengers don’t miss a beat. Starting construction in 1924 after decades of planning, it took more than 15 years to complete the short line, including the steepest grade of any European railway that runs on standard gauge track. Funiculars and miniature railways may rise at more of a slant, but the Flåm line’s five and a half percent grade is hard work for a locomotive, and the payoff is some of the most beautiful fjord landscape in Scandinavia. With a grade on this much of a slope, keeping control of the train’s speed is crucial, both going up and coming down. The engine averages around 19 mph (30 km/h) on the downhill trek to Flåm, and tops out at 25 miles an hour (40 km/h) on the way up to Myrdal. You can almost hear the train whispering “I think I can, I think I can…” Flåm is in southern Norway, at the bottom end of Aurlands Fjord. You can get your tickets at the station, or on-line through the Norwegian National Railroad website (https://www.nsb.no/en/frontpage). It can be crowded during cruise ship season, and a seat is not guaranteed (or reserved). You can go round trip or one way (one way is about an hour). A popular alternative is to take the train from Flam to Myrdal and rent bikes to ride back down to Flam on the nearby paved road."
62,Steinsdalsfossen Waterfall,"Kvam, Norway",Walk behind a 50-meter-high waterfall.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/steinsdalfossen,"Steinsdalsfossen waterfall is one of the most visited attractions in Norway for good reason - it has a path behind it which allow visitors to have a closer look behind the falls. At night, the water is illuminated with purple and blue floodlights. Steinsdalsfossen is 50 meters high, is located 2 kilometers east of Norheimsund, and belongs to Fosselva river. It has been a popular destination for generations. For 25 years straight, missing only two seasons, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany made a trip to visit Steinsdalsfossen every summer. He only stopped at the outbreak of World War I. The falls are active almost all year, but are most spectacular when the snow melts in May and June. Its unique location allows for tourists to take a look behind the waterfall as well, there is a small steep path leading up behind the fall. The powers of the water has been an inspiration for many plays and concerts during summer season. In the melting period the waterfall will grow twice as big, and adds to an even more spectacular sight. Feeling a bit hungry? There is a small kiosk with outdoor table and chair right next to the waterfall. Here you can find everything from souvenirs to ice cream. If you would like something more then it is 5min, 3.0 km by car to the closest town, Nordheimsund. Need a place to stay? In Nordheimsund you can also find beautiful Sandven Hotel built in 1857 and located down by the Hardangerfjord water."
63,Svalbard Seed Bank,Norway,Cold storage for agricultural biodiversity.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/svalbard-seed-bank,"Your grandma is right. The bananas that you can buy today in your local supermarket are not as sweet as the ones that she ate in her childhood. There are many types or “cultivars” of any given fruit – a cultivar is a cultivated plant which is chosen and given a special name because of its desired characteristics – and various types of cultivars (for example in apples, the Red Delicious in the 1870s) come in and out of favor over the years. In the middle of 20th century the dominant banana cultivar exported to North America and Europe was the Gros Michel. However, sometime around 1950, it become virtually extinct due to the rapid spread of the so called “Panama Disease,” a fungal infection that attacks the roots of the banana plant. The Gros Michel was replaced with more resilient but notably less tasty Cavendish cultivar. Modern agriculture is generally focused on maximizing profit by extracting maximal possible yield of crop. A small number of specially selected cultivars of any given crop are planted throughout the world, displacing in the process numerous other local varieties. This approach guarantees consistently high yields under normal conditions but it also harbors a hidden danger. Essentially, every single commercially grown plant is a clone of one of only a few specially selected strains of genetic material. Diversity of genetic material is thus reduced to a bare minimum, leaving crop species exposed to any disease which can exploit that single strain. With corn, wheat, and rice being grown world wide in such a fashion, there is a concern that a newly mutated strain of fungus could wipe out an entire world crop in matter of months, and cause massive food shortages. In order to preserve gene diversity of major food crops, international institutions have established a series of green gene banks, which store samples of genetic material of various strains of each plant species. Svalbard Seed Bank is meant as a sort of safety net, a reserve of last resort and the vault functions like a genetic safety deposit box. It stores duplicate specimens from genebanks worldwide and while the Svalbard seed bank owns the building, the individual depositor owns the contents of his or her box and the access to individual specimens is regulated by their respective depositors. The facility currently has a capacity to conserve 4.5 million seed samples. With approximately 1.5 million distinct seed samples of agricultural crops thought to exist, the Svalbard Seed Bank can store roughly three of each sample. Under the current temperature conditions in the vault (temperatures similar to those in a kitchen freezer) the seed samples can remain viable to begin new crops for anywhere from 2000 to 20,000 years. The seed bank is located in an old copper mine on remote northern island of Spitsbergen, Norway. The main storage is 120m inside a sandstone mountain, on a tectonically dead island. The bank employs a number of robust security and preservation systems. Seeds are packaged in special four-ply packets and heat sealed to exclude moisture. A local coal mine and powerplant supplies the electricity for refrigeration control. The remote northern location also serves as a natural fridge. In the case of complete power failure at least several weeks will elapse before the temperature rises to the ?3 °C of the surrounding sandstone bedrock. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault opened for deposits officially on February 26, 2008 with the construction of the vault financed entirely by Norwegian Government. The operational cost is currently shared by Norway and the Global Crop Diversity Trust.  The Svalbard Seed Bank is situated near the town of Longyearbyen, the biggest settlement on Svalbard.Svalbard Airport Longyear (LYR) is services daily Scandinavian Airlines (SAS Braathens) flights to Tromsø all year around, and there are additional flights as well as twice-weekly services direct to Oslo in the summer high season. The low-cost Norwegian carrier Norwegian.no operates several flights a week to Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger."
64,Emanuel Vigeland Mausoleum,"Oslo, Norway",An artist's mausoleum with a haunting echo.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/emanuel-vigeland-museum,"Brother to the more celebrated Gustav Vigeland, whose eccentric sculptures occupy a prominent park in central Oslo, Emanuel Vigeland (1875-1948) will be remembered through his own strange and enchanting artistic work. Dubbed Oslo’s “best-kept secret” by locals, the Emanuel Vigeland Museum serves double duty as a mausoleum designed and decorated by Vigeland himself. The building is entered by stooping through a heavy, low iron door. Inside, a large, darkened barrel-vaulted room is completely covered with paintings that show human life from conception to death in explicitly erotic scenes. The 800-square-meter fresco took Vigeland 20 years to finish. Entering the mausoleum is a solemn, even haunting, experience. Even the smallest footstep echoes across the barrel-vaulted ceiling for up to 14 seconds. A flashlight is needed to reveal the room’s dark-painted walls. Vigeland began construction on the building in 1926 with the intention of later filling it with his paintings and sculptures. At this point, only one wall and the ceiling of the barrel-vaulted room were to be covered by paintings; the rest would be left to showcase other works. When Vigeland decided that the museum would also serve as his mausoleum, he had the windows sealed with bricks, lending the entire building an eerie atmosphere. He completed the fresco, finding inspiration in the burial chambers of Antiquity and drawing especially from the dramatic stories of Creation and the Original Sin from Christianity. Named Vita, or “Life,” the fresco focuses on “man’s sexual instinct, conveyed through multitudes of naked bodies, women, and men in impetuous intimacy,” according to the museum’s official website. After Vigeland’s death, his ashes were put to rest in an urn that sits above the main entrance. Taken over as a private foundation, the museum was opened to the public in 1959, more than a decade after Vigeland’s death. Today, the museum is only open to the public for a few short hours each week, but it plays host to several concerts (sometimes involving didgeridoos) throughout the year. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the Emanuel Vigeland Mausoleum.

65,Kaplica Czaszek: The Chapel of Skulls,"Kudowa-Zdrój, Poland","The walls and ceiling of this Polish church are decorated with thousands of skulls, with another 21,000 skeletons just below.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaplica-czazek-chapel-skulls,"In 1776, while America was declaring its independence from England, and bodies were piling up in the American revolutionary war, a priest and grave digger in the small Polish town of Czermna, (a kilometer to the north of Kudowa Zdroj) were also busy piling up bodies, but for a very different purpose. Within the modest looking St. Batholomew’s Church (also called the Kaplica Czaszek) are the skulls and bones of over 3,000 people, decorating the ceiling and walls, and arranged in various patterns — mostly in a repeating crossed bones Jolly Roger-style — with another 21,000 skeletons stuffed in the church crypt below. Collected by Czech priest Vaclav Tomasek and J. Langer, the local grave digger, it took the pair some 18 years, from 1776 to 1794, to collect, clean and arrange the as many as 24,000 human skeletons that pack the church. While the majority of the skeletons are stacked in a 16-foot deep crypt beneath the church, the rest are beautifully displayed in what Tomasek saw as a “sanctuary of silence.” The two had plenty to choose from in terms of raw materials. The Thirty Years War, the Seven Years War, and numerous other skirmishes between Catholic, Hussite and Protestants, Poles, Czech and Germans that bordered the area, left mass graves aplenty, not to mention the cholera epidemics that routinely killed hundreds. Tomasek apparently found the mass graves by watching where local dogs went to dig for bones. As the two uncovered and cleaned the thousands of skeletons, the priest and grave digger set aside skulls of interest for display in the church. Today the skulls are still displayed, and include a Tartar warrior’s skull, the Czermna mayor and his wife, skulls with bullet holes, a skull Swiss-cheesed by syphilis, and even the skull of a giant. Besides these special skulls are those of the priest and the grave digger themselves, presiding proudly over the Chapel of Skulls they created and now call their final resting place. A trapdoor to the crypt below can be opened to reveal the other 21,000 skeletons stacked just below. There is a recording in the church that explains the history of the chapel, but so far it is only available in Polish, Czech, and German. Unfortunately no photos are now allowed inside the Chapel.

66,Crooked Forest,"Gryfino, Poland",Countless stories attempt to explain Poland's mysterious J-shaped trees.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gryfino-forest,"Blending science fiction and ecological abnormality, a group of 400 trees in Poland’s Krzywy Las or “the Crooked Forest,” are mysteriously and identically bent. Hovering just inches above the ground, the trees dramatically take a sharp turn toward the sky, rounding into little J shapes as they make their ascent. There is no definitive answer for these pines’ bizarre shape, and the stories about them run the gamut from the practical to the bizarre. The most grounded explanation among those seeking answers is that the trees may have simply been buried beneath a terrible snowstorm in their infancy. Others still believe the gravitational pull in that area has morphed their trunks. The most intriguing explanation suggests that local foresters manipulated the trees after planting them in 1925-1928. Apparently, the foresters hoped to make furniture from the bent shapes and intervened when the trees were only 10 years old. Refusing to let the trees grow upwards, the foresters severely stunted their growth. Likely abandoning their efforts after the start of WWII in 1939, the foresters left a lasting ecological mark 80 years later. Every tree in the Crooked Forest has the same haunting bend, but despite bent beginnings, they have all grown to be tall and seemingly unhampered by their C-shape curves. Trees are resilient, and so they continued to thrive, relying on the one branch they had left to take over complete function and grow upwards. Whatever damage occurred to one tree must have happened to them all because they remain uniform in deformity.  The easiest way to get to the Crooked Forest is by taking a taxi or bus line 1 from Gryfino."
67,Rynek Underground,"Krakow, Poland",Beneath Kraków Old Town's main square lies a hologram-filled medieval market vampire graveyard wonderland.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rynek-underground,"Standing on the cobblestones of Kraków’s historic market square, it would be easy to miss the 4,000-square-meter archaeological site/high-tech multimedia extravaganza a mere four meters below your feet, known as Rynek Underground. The subterranean excavation of the square began in 2005, after the discovery of various artifacts around Kraków’s famous Cloth Hall led to speculation about what else might be found below street level. What was discovered was a treasure trove of items and structural remnants that paint a vivid picture of everyday commercial life in Kraków over the past 700 years, and even beyond. The unique, fully-underground excavation uncovered not only the remnants of merchant stalls and various quotidian objects — such as weights, coins, clothing, and jewelry — but also preserved stretches of medieval thoroughfares, remnants of a settlement that was destroyed by raiding Tatars in 1241, centuries-old aqueducts, and a cemetery showcasing some of the peculiar burial practices of the 11th century. Rynek Underground, opened in 2010, is the museum that was built to showcase this treasure trove of Kraków history, and mixes the artifacts and restored archaeological sites with lasers, smoke machines, holograms, and 600 three-dimensional models of everyday objects manipulated via 37 touchscreens. Visitors to Rynek Underground are first greeted by holographic 14th-century Krakovians projected onto a curtain of smoke, which is parted to reveal an immersive environment representing daily life in medieval Kraków Included in the historical cornucopia are displays depicting burial practices from 1,000 years ago, including the method for burying a suspected vampire. Long-established in Polish folklore, vampires were believed to only become creatures of the night after death. Likely candidates for future vampirism could be identified via their red hair or rows of extra teeth. In order to prevent the undead from rising, “vampires” were buried in a fetal position, with hands tied and heads cut off and placed beneath their feet. This would, it was believed, slow them down quite a bit upon reanimation — and you can see it in practice at Rynek Underground. Given the popularity of the museum and the fact that occupancy is limited to 300 at a time, visitors are advised to buy tickets in advance for a particular entry time. If you have kids, don’t miss the kids’ room, which includes a rousing automated puppet show. If you like lead, don’t miss the 693-kilogram “lead loaf,” which was a highly valuable metal before people figured out that it’s pretty poisonous."
68,Wieliczka Salt Mine,"Wieliczka, Poland",An underground city of salt.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wieliczka-salt-mine,"The Wieliczka Salt Mine in Poland is the epitome of technological human progress. The beginnings of the current mine are believed to have been primitively excavated after the discovery of a rock salt deposit in ancient times. In the middle ages, salt became recognized as one of the most important staples in the food and preservation industry, leading to the advancement of salt mining technology and further excavation. During the Renaissance, the mine was one of the largest business ventures in Europe. It was around this time that royal tourists started to flock to the mine, lured there in part by the developing Renaissance taste for humanism and culture. By the late 18th century, Austria gained control of the mine and brought new forms of organization, as well as further technological advancement - many of which are responsible for the longevity of the mine. The birth of general tourism in the mine occurred during Austrian rule. In the early 1990s, the production of salt in the mine ceased, and after the mine flooded, the importance of preservation was reestablished. Despite the mine’s remarkable history, it is the miner artwork (and later artwork by others) that brings over a million tourists to the Wieliczka Salt Mine each year. The miners slowly turned the mine from a dark cave into a majestic royal location. By the 19th century, giant salt-crystal chandeliers lighted the underground complex. Striking salt-carved monuments and reliefs decorated chambers available to tourists, resulting in Europe-wide fame. In the early 1900s, the Kinga Chapel was formed, a chamber filled with large biblical reliefs. Nowadays, tourists from all over the world are guided through the bizarre labyrinthine tunnels of the mine, astonished by the beautifully detailed sculptures, chapels, and even a restaurant as they relive over a thousand years of salty history. In recent years, the mine has been touted for its health benefits. The atmosphere inside is said to be excellent for those suffering from a number of types of respiratory illnesses, and guests can now stay at a special health center/resort there. The Wieliczka Salt Mine is one of the world’s oldest salt mines still in operation.  In 1978, the mine was inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List."
69,The Bones of the Wawel Dragon,"Krakow, Poland",Real bones which are said to have belonged to a Polish dragon.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-bones-of-the-wawel-dragon-krakow-poland,"Poland’s Wawel Cathedral holds the remains of a number of Polish royals as well as some of the country’s most famous religious art, but the real attraction at the massive religious compound is the hanging bundle of bones which are rumored to have belonged to a local dragon. Hanging next to the cathedral’s entrance are the “real” bones of the Smok Wawelski—the Wawel dragon. They are chained together in a random jumble, hanging high above the main doors. Before the city was founded, the dragon was said to live in a cave under one of Wawel’s rolling hills. He was of the classic maiden-devouring ilk and the local people even had to put out a fresh young woman each month to quell his appetite. According to legend, he was finally killed by a local hero (or a local apprentice depending on the version), who fed Smok a lamb laced with sulfur. This made the beast so thirsty that he drank water from the river until he exploded. As delightful as it would be if the remains were truly mythological, the bones are actually thought to be fossilized whale bones or mammoth bones. Regardless of their true origin, they have been there for centuries and are credited with magical powers."
70,Wawel Dragon's Den,"Krakow, Poland","This Polish cave has housed a dragon, a brothel, and an enduring legend.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wawel-dragons-den,"There are differing legends about how the city of Krakow got its name. Fortunately, every version involves a dragon. According to the stories, a ferocious dragon once lived in the cave that is now part of the Wawel Castle complex. The lizard terrorized the city below for many months, requiring weekly offerings of cattle. Should the townspeople fail to provide the requisite number of animals, the dragon would scorch and devour an equal number of human beings. Here’s where the stories diverge. One says that a cobbler named Krak came up with the idea of stuffing a dead sheep full of sulphur and leaving it out for the dragon as a handy snack. Once eaten, the sulphur ignited in the creature’s belly, forcing it to gulp down gallons of water from the River Vistula until eventually, it exploded. Krak then married a princess, became king, built a castle atop the cave, and named the city in his honor. In another version, the dragon appeared during the reign of King Krakus (sometimes called Gracchus). The beleaguered king asked his two sons, Lech and Krakus II, to rid the city of the fiery scourge. Lech and Krakus came up with the same solution as cobbler Krak, but following the dragon’s explosion, began to quarrel about which of them deserved credit for the dragonslaying. Lech killed Krakus, and told the townspeople that his brother had been killed in battle. When the secret was eventually revealed, Lech was exiled from the country and the city was renamed for the innocent Krakus. The cave itself where the dragon is said to have lived is made up of a series of limestone rooms, that in medieval times served as a tavern and brothel. Today, it is a popular tourist attraction. A fearsome bronze sculpture by artist Bronislaw Chromy was installed at the entrance to the dragon’s den in 1972. Although the sculpture has seven heads, only one breathes fire (thanks to an ingeniously-placed natural gas nozzle)."
71,Auschwitz Concentration Camp,"Oswiecim, Poland",The former Nazi concentration camp stands as a museum to remember this dark chapter in European history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/auschwitz-concentration-camp,"Auschwitz is best known for its horrific story. Many people lost their lives in the concentration camp during World War II. Today it is a museum to remember that dark chapter in European history. The museum is split in two parts. The first is the brick buildings that housed staff, the sick, and various medical experiments. Today you can visit most of the buildings, listen to stories of single people, see their photographs, and the belongings that were stolen from them. A strong stomach is recommended for parts of the museum as it will bring tears to the eyes of even the strongest people. You can go inside solitary cells, one of the smaller gas chamber and crematoriums. The second part of the camp is the one best known from movies. Most barracks have been torn down just after the war but the chimneys remains standing, reminding the visitor how many people were forced to live here until they died from exhaustion or gas. A couple of barracks can still be visited. The crematoriums, where every day 600 people were killed, have been destroyed and can only be observed from a platform. There is also a smallish lake that holds the ashes of countless men, women, and children. Several memorials and signs tell the story of the disturbing place.  There are two parts to the museum, as this was actually two camps. There are car parks available, free shuttles, or you can walk (3km). Admission is free, but it's well worth it to invest in a guided tour. Even though admission is free, there are limited number of tickets available daily and are all pretty much taken by the tour agencies leaving you no choice but to go on a guided tour. Be sure to check ahead if you want to go by yourself and double check what language the tour will be in in case there happens to be free tickets."
72,The Neon Museum,"Warsaw, Poland",A program of Communist glamour in post-Stalin Poland is preserved in this colorful museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-neon-museum-warsaw-poland,"After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, the Eastern Bloc went through the so-called Khrushchev Thaw that saw a relaxation of social and cultural repression. In Poland, one consequence of this shift was an era of “neonization,” an official policy to bring some of the glitz of Western nightscapes to the streets of Polish cities. The Neon Museum seeks to preserve and display the signs produced under this odd, charming state program. The museum’s collection consists of hundreds of neon signs that were put up throughout Poland from the 1950s to the 1970s. Commissioned and installed by Reklame, the official state advertising agency, the signs were frequently designed to promote cultural and nightlife venues as well as a (theoretically) burgeoning consumer culture. However, since there were no brand names or privately owned shops or businesses, the signs often simply stated what could (again, theoretically) be found at a location (e.g., “Jewelry,” “Sewing Machines,” “Dancing,” “Theater,” etc.) in graceful loops of electric color. The signs were designed by some of Poland’s most prominent artists and graphic designers, and frequently featured totally unique, hand-written fonts. There were many non-typographical, purely decorative signs as well, designed to beautify drab facades and animate the night sky. These neon signs became a defining characteristic of Polish city streets and served as landmarks for the people below. As these signs started to disappear in the post-Cold War era, photographer Ilona Karwinska set out to document this unique industrial art form that left an indelible mark on a particular period of Polish urban life. The resulting exhibition, “Polish Neon,” laid the groundwork for The Neon Museum, which Karwinska opened with her partner David Hill in 2012. It is the largest collection of neon signs in Europe.  Photographers, be aware: only mobile phones are allowed to take pictures inside. No DSLR's or other types of cameras."
73,Ruins at Westerplatte,"Gdańsk, Poland",The site of the first battle of World War II.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruins-at-westerplatte,"On a tiny, cold and wet peninsula, outside the Free City of Danzig, the first shots of World War Two were fired. The first battle of the most devastating conflict in human history began when, on September 1, 1939, at 4:48 am, the German battleship Schleswig-Holstein let loose a barrage of artillery onto the Polish naval depot, Westerplatte. Despite the fact that Westerplatte was tiny and poorly guarded, it was a surprise to few that this would become the site of the first battle of a war long in the making. Within the Free City of Danzig (Gdańsk, today), Nazi support was at an all-time high among the largely German local population, which Hitler’s government had been trying to annex into the Third Reich for years. Westerplatte was the location of the only Polish military presence in the area. For nearly a decade, the Polish military had been warning its allies that a German attack was imminent, but provisions stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles limited the strength of the Westerplatte compound to just 88 soldiers. Against the treaty and in preparation of the ensuing violence, the Polish naval garrison began reinforcing their meager existing fortifications with machine guns, mortars, and antitank weaponry while the number of soldiers stationed there was nearly tripled. It was all for naught, as the Germans won the battle, but against all odds, the outnumbered and outgunned Polish soldiers were able to keep a force more than ten times their number at bay for seven days. In the end, of the 3,400 Germans who took part in the battle, 300 died. Only around 15 of the 210 Polish forces perished. German General, Friedrich-Georg Eberhardt, was so impressed with the valor and heroism of the Polish forces that, following the battle, he allowed Polish Major Henryk Sucharski to carry his saber into captivity and saluted the fallen Polish forces. The heroism of the loss became a rallying cry for Polish underground resistance throughout the war and the battle has been compared by Polish historians to Thermopylae and Verdun. Today, an outdoor museum with a walkable exhibition leads you through the history of the peninsula, as well as the prelude, duration, and aftermath of the battle. Memorials at the site to the fallen Polish soldiers are continuously decorated with flowers and candles. Ruined buildings from the battle have been stabilized and can be walked through. In 1966, the Soviet Government gifted a massive monument to the site called “A Monument to the Defenders of the Coast.” A large sign stands next to the monument reads “Nigdy Więcej Wojny”: War Never Again. There are three primary ways to arrive at the battleground and memorial. By car is the most efficient and parking is free. (It should cost around 25zł by taxi from the city center.) City bus 106 runs everyday, year round and leaves from Gdańsk’s central station. The last option is by ferry on the Żegluga Gdańska boat. The outdoor exhibition is free, open 24/7, and takes between 2-3 hours to explore. Reading material is in Polish, English, and German."
74,Książ Castle,"Walbrzych, Poland",A fairytale Gothic castle steeped in Nazi treasure conspiracy theories.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ksiaz-castle,"Shrouded in secrets within the Owl Mountains of southwestern Poland, there sits a magnificent castle where many Nazi conspiracy theories find their roots. Ksiaz Castle is an impressive fortress rising up on a cliff embankment and surrounded by lush forests and immaculate gardens. With a history that dates to the 12th century, the imposing complex has had a wide variety of important owners and architectural acknowledgments that are worth a visit in their own right. Today, however, it is what lies under the castle that draws people’s attention. Ksiaz was confiscated by the Nazis during World War II, and tens of thousands of Nazi prisoners, mainly Jews from Hungary and Poland, were forced to build a massive subterranean complex with 12-meter high ceilings beneath the Gothic and Baroque ramparts that rose above. Most of the network of underground structures lie unfinished directly beneath the castle and in the surrounding area, all part of the mysterious Project Riese (German for “giant”). One of the largest Nazi construction projects during the war, Project Riese continues to baffle historians and scholars due to it’s top-secret status and the few documents that remain detailing it’s purpose. One thing is for certain: Upon completion of Project Riese the castle was to become Adolf Hitler’s personal headquarters. It never did though. The project was never finished and Ksiaz was eventually captured by the Red Army which stole, destroyed, and secreted much of the information relevant to the project. To this day, little but word of mouth rumors and stories can be gleaned from locals who tell of secret atomic weapons or hidden Nazi trains that are laden with valuable art and treasure, said to be booby trapped with extensive weaponry and lying within the soil around the complex. Every year, treasure seekers from around the globe can be found hunting the hills around the castle with metal detectors and dowsing rods, hoping to be the one to find a cache of Nazi gold or any sort of hint to the secrets the castle’s underground complexes may hold. From Wroclaw, the castle is easy to get to by public services. Take a train from Wroclaw to Walbrzych-Miasto station which will take around an hour and thirty minutes and cost 14.60 zloty, and then jump on the number 8 or 12 bus. Alternatively you can drive the 70km from Wroclaw. Taxis from Walbrzych-Miasto are usually around 20-30 zloty."
75,The Wolf's Lair,"Ketrzyn, Poland",This Nazi ruin was the site where Hitler was almost blown up by a suitcase bomb.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-wolf-s-lair-ketrzyn-poland,"Hidden deep in a Polish forest, the remains of the Nazi stronghold known as The Wolf’s Lair (Wolfsschanze) are slowly being reclaimed by nature, but the room where Operation Valkyrie nearly blew up Hitler with a suitcase bomb can still be found. Built in 1941, miles removed from the nearest village, The Wolf’s Lair was Germany’s secret headquarters on the Eastern Front. The heavily fortified concrete bunker buildings were protected behind multiple layers of security and the location of the site was a well-kept secret, ensuring that the Nazi leaders could strategize in relative safety. In fact Hitler would spend the better part of the war’s final years at the site. Of course they were largely wary of outside attempts at assasination and therefore felt invulnerable to assasination attempts which might come from within. Thus when a German colonel, looking to put an end to Hitler’s mad rule, concocted a plan to assassinate the Führer, he chose The Wolf’s Lair as the place to do it. Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg was able to sneak a suitcase bomb with a timer device into a meeting room where he knew Hitler would be. Even after the meeting Stauffenberg had planned to set off the bomb in was moved to a different space and a different time, he was still able to detonate the bomb with Hitler in the room while the fascist leader was studying a map of the Eastern Front. Miraculously, and unfortunately Hitler survived the blast with minor injuries due to a member of staff who moved the suitcase slightly further under the table where it had been placed (and who himself lost a leg in the explosion). However The Wolf’s Lair had been compromised. Given the blast and the swiftly approaching Soviet forces, the Nazis abandoned the base by the next year and destroyed most of it with explosives. Despite the destructive tactics of the Nazis, large portions of the heavily fortified base remained intact and have simply sat amongst their Polish forest surrounds for decades. The ruins are now covered in moss and lichen.  You must pay for parking and entrance. Fencing surrounds the site and you will be requested to follow the way of visit. Tour guide in several language is available on foot or in authentic war car."
76,The Painted Village of Zalipie,"Zalipie, Poland",This uber-quaint Polish village is known for its habit of painting elaborate floral motifs on just about everything.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-painted-village-of-zalipie-zalipie-poland,"Stoves, barns, doghouses, homes, wells, chicken coops, bridge, and on and on.  If it’s in the small Polish village of Zalipie, there are probably some flowers painted on it. Known lovingly as “The Painted Village,” nearly every bare surface in the village, be it stone or wood has been decorated with intricate floral patterns in a tradition that dates back almost a hundred years. While there is little concrete evidence to support the story, the belief is that the habit of painting flowers on the walls began in the days when soot and smoke issued from everyone’s tiny wood-burning stoves. As the black marks from the soot appeared on the interior and exterior walls of the homes in Zalipie, the women would simply cover them with painted flowers. In the beginning they would even make their own brushes out of cow hair and make paint out of cooking fat and dye. By the time of the turn of the century, the old world stoves were replaced with chimneys and cleaner modern ventilation, eliminating the practical need for the tradition, but instead of dying out, the practice just became more elaborate. By this time, the decorative tradition was a part of the Zalipie identity and with the advent of better paints and more varied colors, the rustic floral patterns expanded to intricately weaving vine illustrations accented by vibrant flowers in every color of the rainbow. The paintings also began to spread from the walls of personal homes out onto nearly every blank surface, like graffiti from a street crew of grandmas. The secluded is as vibrant and quaint as ever, although one house which was particularly painted upon has been turned into a museum about the village."
77,Galeria Forty / Forty,"Warsaw, Poland",A hidden art gallery in an abandoned Warsaw fort.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/galeria-forty-forty,"An abandoned fort in Warsaw attempts to eschew the limitations often imposed by closed exhibition spaces and instead celebrates the spontaneity and anarchism of street art. The walls of the unsupervised Northern Barracks building, which is open 24 hours a day, are covered in images and text and installed art. There are plenty of different styles on display in the old tsar’s barracks, including stencils, tagging, and installations. The project is run by the Outdoor Art Foundation, and the works and structure are protected by the Capital Conservator of Monuments. Artworks created by those invited to the project are mixed with text and images added spontaneously by “uninvited” graffiti artists and vandals. The art within the walls of the fort is constantly changing and decaying, just as street art in the wild. Each artist is encouraged to create spontaneously and individually, without any of the restrictions commonly placed on gallery works. The abandoned building, built in the 1880s, isn’t easy to find, making it a favorite among both locals and adventurous travelers. And the art makes for a kind of low-budget revitalization project, helping to preserve and draw visitors to the old fort."
78,Chopin's Heart,"Warsaw, Poland","After the famous composer died in Paris, his sister snuck his heart out of the country to honor his wish that it be buried in their native country.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chopin-s-heart,"During his final days, famed Polish composer Frédéric Chopin made the gruesome request that his heart be taken from his corpse and sent back to his home country, knowing full well that his body would never leave Paris. When he passed, Chopin’s eldest sister, Ludwika Jędrzejewicz, complied with his request, taking the heart before his body could be buried and secreting it back to Poland in a jar of booze (most likely cognac). Jędrzejewicz hid the hearty package under her cloak, avoiding officers and agents that might ask too many questions about the body part she was carrying. She was able to smuggle it to the Holy Cross Church in Warsaw, where it was buried beneath a small monument. Given Chopin’s popularity in his native Poland, the monument to his heart quickly became a rallying point for proud nationalists. During World War II, the Nazis, knowing the power the composer’s legacy held over the people, stole the heart (as well as outlawing playing his music). However, after the war, they gave it back. The heart was reinterred in the church and remains there to this day, undisturbed until recently. In 2014 a secret Ocean’s 11-like group of church officials, scientists, and medical experts dug up the heart under cover of night. As evocative as the situation sounds, the group was actually just checking the container preserving the heart. They feared it might have cracked, which would have allowed the heart to dry out and decay. Knowing how beloved Chopin still is among the Polish people they simply wanted to avoid causing a public outcry at the exhumation. Though Chopin’s heart is no longer beating, luckily it is still in great condition."
79,Wisłoujście Fortress,"Gdańsk, Poland",This 700-year-old structure is one of the most unique architectural and historic monuments in Gdańsk.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wisloujscie-fortress,"The Wisłoujście Fortress is a strategic outpost at the mouth of the Vistula River, where it empties into the Baltic Sea. The traffic of all ships traveling to and from the port of Gdańsk can be seen and monitored from here, which is why this unique circular fort was a key defensive point for Poland for centuries, starting in the early 14th century. The earliest records of a watchtower in this area date back to 1308, but it wasn’t until over a century later the first permanent fortification building was erected. In 1482, a round tower was built and functioned as a watchtower and lighthouse. Throughout history, the fortress was expanded and remodeled again and again, and a number of additional buildings were arranged around this central tower. In the 16th century, a circular battery consisting of a set of bastions and casemates were added to the structure, to better position the firearms. The foundation of the fort rests on wooden underground bunkers hidden beneath the water, where a collection of historic weapons is now housed. Over the years the importance of this fortress waned, and it was badly damaged by the Soviet Army during the Second World War. Luckily in 1974, the Museum of Gdansk obtained this area and realized the historical importance of the site. The restoration works are still ongoing, but many of the original structures have been restored and can be visited today. Update as of July 2021: The fortress (including the exterior) is currently closed to visitors due to renovation work, which is expected to last until 2024. Bus service to the fortress has also been suspended.  The fortress is easily accessed by car or bus from the city. You can see the exterior free of charge but tickets are needed to climb the tower or tour the casemates. Open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. during the spring and summer months. Closed from October until the end of April."
80,Warsaw Gasworks Museum,"Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw's fantastically preserved gasworks...almost.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/warsaw-gasworks-museum,"Beautifully preserved, the Warsaw Gasworks (also known as the “Wola Gas Company”) is one of the most pristine examples of historical industrial architecture from the late 19th and early 20th century. It’s almost a shame, because it would make a fabulous decaying urban adventure to explore. As luck would have it, this place has a little in column A and a little in column B. The majority of the grounds have been beautifully restored, and in what used to be the compressor and pump building resides a huge, diverse museum that includes an in-depth history of Poland’s evolution with gas production. It houses documents and archives of photos, but most impressively, a healthy collection of the machinery used both industrially and in private homes throughout the decades. Gas lamps from every era, some of which still adorn Warsaw’s streets, and assorted home appliances are dwarfed by the massive machinery that once made up the guts of the city’s gas supply. The neoclassical style buildings were built in 1888, but were destroyed during in 1939 during WWII, then immobilized. After the war they were rebuilt, and reopened their doors June 25, 1945. They once again closed in the early 70s, as natural gas became the city’s singular method. It’s been a museum since 1977. While the beautiful buildings and fine museum halls are clean and shiny, there are still parts of the old–delightfully decrepit buildings that have yet to be beautified. Old, enormous gas tanks, and behind the museum–the colosseum. The colosseum is a massive, spherical building that understandably attracts urban explorers and photographers like moths to a flame. Broken windows, crumbling brick, and untamed vegetation abound. Poking around is forbidden, (yes, they do have video cameras) but brave explorers do manage to get over the fence now and then. It’s magnificence can still be enjoyed from a distance, and the museum–which is refreshingly free of charge–has plenty of wonderful old machinery to discover within the safety of its walls. Update as of December 2019: The museum is currently undergoing renovations and may be closed, phone ahead to see if they are open."
81,Quinta da Regaleira,"Sintra, Portugal","This eccentrically decorated palace is replete with grottoes, fountains, tunnels, and caves.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/quinta-da-regaleira,"Quinta de Regaleira is a UNESCO World Heritage site designed by Carvalho Monteiro. Italian architect Luigi Manini designed the four-hectare estate with its enigmatic buildings, believed to hide symbols related to alchemy, Masonry, the Knights Templar, and the Rosicrucians. The architecture of the palace evokes Roman, Gothic, Renaissance and Manueline architectural styles. The construction of the current estate commenced in 1904 and most of it was concluded by 1910. The gardens are incredibly ornate. Set on a hillside, a multitude of fountains, grottoes, statues, caves, and ponds are connected both above ground via lovely paths and by a series of underground tunnels lit today by strings of Christmas lights. The grounds also include a chapel and an aquarium, built to look as if it naturally existed amongst the rock."

Its art nouveau façade hides a beautiful Neo-Gothic interior, with a stained glass ceiling, carved wood paneling, and a breathtaking, curvaceous staircase that stretches across the store. Designed by Xavier Esteves, over the windows can be seen figures painted by José Bielman, representing “Science” and “Art.” Along with a stained glass window bearing a monogram of “Lello and Brother” with their motto Decus in Labore (“Honor in Work”), are plant motifs and geometric shapes. Opened in 1906, Livraria Lello is an established bookstore, but it has certainly aged well over the years. It is consistently named one of the most beautiful bookstores in the world.  There is now a ticket office to pre-buy your entry at the corner to the left of the Livraria. Be prepared for crowds of Potter-heads."
83,Carmo Convent Ruins,"Lisbon, Portugal",Legacy of the earthquake that nearly wiped Lisbon off the face of the Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/carmo-convent-ruins,"“Come, ye philosophers, who cry, ‘All’s well,’ and contemplate this ruin of a world.” -Voltaire, 1756 One of the deadliest earthquakes in history struck Lisbon on All-Saint’s Day, November 1, 1755. The city was all but destroyed, and the ancient Carmo convent and church lay in ruins, its library of 5000 books destroyed. Today the ruined arches stand in the middle of the rebuilt city as a reminder of the worst day in Lisbon’s history. The magnitude 9 earthquake struck at about 9:30 am on the Saturday morning, tearing wide gashes in the earth. Because it was All Saints Day, the churches were full and homes were lit with candles. The tremor was followed by a series of devastating tsunamis and five days of raging fires which devoured the buildings left standing. It was one of the deadliest quakes in history, leaving an unknown total number dead (usually named as about 60,000 people though estimates range from 10,000 - 100,000), and 85% of the city in total ruins. The tragedy rocked Europe. Lisbon was a major city and seaport, home to the famous navigators of the great Age of Discovery, and among the oldest continually settled cities on Earth. The earthquake and fires destroyed more than just homes, it took out the royal palace, destroyed the opera house, cathedral, and library. It incinerated most of the maps and journals of the great explorers, and countless works of art. Survivors lived in tent cities in the outskirts of town, traumatized and too terrified to return to the city center, given over to looters and the dead. King Joseph I and his family survived to flee the city as well. The king’s resulting fear of confined spaces stayed with him for the rest of his life, and the royal court remained in an elaborate version of a tent city until his death. The earthquake inspired a frenzy of philosophical and religious soul searching, and some famous battles of wits. Voltaire, horrified by the tragedy and annoyed by religious accusations that Lisbon had been leveled in an act of divine retribution for the lewd lifestyles of its citizens, wrote his “Poem on the Disaster in Lisbon” in 1756. The poem reads, in part: “What crime, what sin, had those young hearts conceived That lie, bleeding and torn, on mother’s breast? Did fallen Lisbon deeper drink of vice Than London, Paris, or sunlit Madrid?” His vitriol was directed particularly towards the (long-dead) philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who subscribed to a theory that God, being all powerful and all knowing, had created the best of all possible worlds and everything that happens in it - earthquakes included - are a part of his master plan. In 1759 Voltaire added to his arguments with his satirical book “Candide” or “Optimism.” The story follows an eternally optimistic young protagonist up against all of the worst the world has to offer including bearing witness to the horrors of the earthquake - inspiring Candide to ask, “If this is the best of all possible worlds, what are the others like?” In Lisbon, life eventually went on. Most of the city was rebuilt, the rubble cleared, and new buildings started. The new Pombaline architecture was named for the practical Prime Minister, the Marquis of Pombal, who immediately turned his energies to rebuilding the city with the famous statement of his plan of action: “Bury the dead and feed the living.” The distinctively modern buildings in the Baixa Pombalina area are considered to be some of the first seismically sound constructions in the world. The Carmo convent which had stood in the center of Lisbon since 1389 was intentionally left roofless as a reminder of the disaster. The property now houses the Museu Arqueológico do Carmo, or Carmo Archaeological Museum, a small archaeological museum dedicated to Portuguese history.  The Carmo Convent is only one minute away from Santa Justa Elevator."
84,The Village of Monsanto,"Idanha-a-Nova, Portugal","Houses are tucked between, on, and underneath giant boulders.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/village-of-monsanto-boulders,"In 1938, the village of Monsanto was dubbed the most “Portuguese town in Portugal.” Yet at first glance, Monsanto certainly does not seem representative of the entire country. For one thing, most Portuguese houses are not sandwiched between gigantic boulders. Defined by its landscape, Monsanto hangs off a mountaintop overlooking the Portuguese countryside, with views for miles.The mountaintop has actually been extremely important strategic position since prehistoric times. It’s crowned by the remains of a Templar castle, which was partially destroyed by an explosion, in the 19th century. The village has hardly changed in hundreds of years, and enjoys distinction in Portugal as a living museum. Due to this standing, Monsanto cannot be changed and has retained its classic village charm. Its tiny streets wind at a steep grade past red-roofed cottages tucked against mossy boulders. Some of the boulders are actually fitted with doors, leading to structures carved right into the rocky landscape. While the mountainous town seems a bit unorthodox, it is actually a unique twist on classic Portuguese architecture. Walking along the cobbled streets it soon becomes evident that Monsanto is a microcosm of Portugal. The architecture even incorporates the Portuguese Manueline style on a number of buildings and a church. While it certainly represents the classic Portuguese village style, visitors will no doubt be more impressed with the cottages built in boulder chic than medieval Romanesque or Manueline.  Accessible by bus from Lisbon and Porto."
85,Portugal's Chapel of Bones,"Évora, Portugal","A 16th century chapel decorated with bones, skulls, and entire bodies hanging from the wall.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/portugals-chapel-bones,"The Chapel of Bones in Évora, Portugal, is part of the larger Royal Church of St. Francis, and was constructed by Franciscan monks in the late 16th century. The Chapel’s story is a familiar one. By the 16th century, there were as many as 43 cemeteries in and around Évora that were taking up valuable land. Not wanting to condemn the souls of the people buried there, the monks decided to build the Chapel and relocate the bones. However, rather than interring the bones behind closed doors, the monks, who were concerned about society’s values at the time, thought it best to put them on display. They thought this would provide Évora, a town noted for its wealth in the early 1600s, with a helpful place to meditate on the transience of material things in the undeniable presence of death. This is made clear by the thought-provoking message above the chapel door: “Nós ossos que aqui estamos, pelos vossos esperamos,” or: “We bones, are here, waiting for yours.” The design of the Chapel of Bones in Evora is based on the ossuary of San Bernadino alla Ossa in Milan, Italy. The immediate view as you enter the Chapel gives you some idea of its scale and the sheer number of bodies that are interred here — some 5,000 corpses. Among them, in a small white coffin by the altar, are the bones of the three Franciscan monks who founded the church in the 13th century. Also included are two desiccated corpses hanging by chains from the wall next to a cross. One is that of a child. The purpose of the Chapel is made clear by a poem (translated below by Rev. Carlos A. Martins), written by Father Antonio da Ascencao, that hangs from one pillars: “Where are you going in such a hurry traveler? Pause… do not advance your travel; You have no greater concern Than this one: that on which you focus your sight. Recall how many have passed from this world, Reflect on your similar end, There is good reason to reflect If only all did the same. Ponder, you so influenced by fate, Among all the many concerns of the world, So little do you reflect on death; If by chance you glance at this place, Stop… for the sake of your journey, The more you pause, the further on your journey you will be.” Just in case all that death should cause you to despair, at the end of the Chapel, above the altar, you can read the Latin phrases: “I die in the light” and “The day that I die is better than the day that I was born.”"

But for 285 years, the Livraria Bertrand, as it is known today, has served Lisbon’s bibliophiles and been a space for intellectual and cultural conversations. Opened in 1732, it holds the Guinness record as the world’s oldest bookstore still in operation. The bookstore was opened by Peter Faure as a small shop in the central Rua Direito do Loreto. It was a favorite haunt of Portuguese writers and intellectuals across different generations. Alexandre Herculano, the 19th-century historian who is widely credited with ushering in Romanticism in Portugal, historian-turned-minister Oliveira Martins, and the prolific novelist Aquilino Ribeiro, are among the Portuguese thinkers who sought out like-minded people at the bookstore. Ribeiro, a Nobel Prize nominee, even had some of his books published by the printing press that was later started by the shop, and the current store has a dedicated “corner of Aquilino.” In 2010, the Livraria Bertrand became part of the Porto Editora group, with branches all over the country. The original remains a Lisbon literary landmark, just like Faure envisioned when he started his business nearly three centuries ago. Hours: Monday-Saturday 9am–10pm, Sunday 11am-8pm"
87,Pena National Palace,"Sintra, Portugal",This unreal Portuguese palace looks as though it's made from a pile of different castles.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pena-national-palace,"Perched high atop a lush hill in São Pedro de Penaferrim, Portugal, the Pena National Palace is a popular national landmark that looks as though it was created by mashing up towers, facades, and architectural flourishes from a bunch of different castles. Built in the 19th century by King Ferdinand II, the palace was meant to be a summer home for the Portuguese royals. Ferdinand’s opulent tastes were imposed on the builders and designers, creating a schizophrenic manse that, at least from the outside, seemed to indulge any and all of the king’s passing tastes. One portion would resemble a medieval European castle complete with ornate parapets, then the portion directly next to it would be modeled after an Islamic tower dome. Each section of the facade was also presented in a different color; a long purple wing is flanked by a red clock tower, and a yellow minaret and so on. It is said that Ferdinand wanted the palace to look like an opera. It is now seen as one of the grandest examples of Romantic architecture. The interior of the palace was no less opulent or eclectic. Many of the rooms were designed to reflect a certain cultural influence ranging from Middle Eastern styles to the European Baroque. When the royal family fled Portugal during the Revolution of 1910, the palace and its grounds were abandoned and fell into disrepair. However the site was restored later in the 20th century, and is now classified as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The palace can now be visited by any peasant willing to make the trek, and it is well worth it since visitors essentially get to experience a whole world of architecture in one stop.   Unfortunately, visitors are not allowed to take pictures of the interior."

Housed in a 1901 building that was formerly a grocery store, the bar’s five rooms are packed with the owner’s personal stash of vintage collectibles and oddities, amounting to a sprawling cabinet of curiosities. There are rows of helmets and military uniforms, vintage paintings in every corner, and shelves with all manner of dolls and action figures. Model planes and boats strung from the darkened ceilings jostle for space with crystal chandeliers. Around the bar counter, china plates and antique mugs hang helter-skelter around perched porcelain figurines. Don’t bump into the British Palace guard mannequin standing at attention on your way to order a drink. Sit at the festively upholstered little booths in one of the rooms, lined on all four sides with ever more cabinets bursting with vintage toys, trains, pins, and more. Order some bacalhau and a bottle of wine, and take in the surroundings in this spirited curiosity-shop-cum-drinking-establishment.

89,Capela de Ossos Bone Chapel,"Faro, Portugal",This small chapel is built of human bones and decorated with a golden skeleton.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/capela-de-ossos-bone-chapel,"With its big windows and light-filled sanctuary, the ossuary in Faro may be one of the cheeriest buildings made of human bones you’ll encounter. The inscription over the door reads: “Stop here and think of the fate that will befall you – 1816,” a helpful reminder put in place by the Carmelite monks who built the chapel that year on the grounds of the larger church dating to 1719. It is not merely decorated with bones — the walls are constructed from femurs with mortar. Skulls and other bones are placed on the interior at regular intervals, including grinning down from the barrel-vaulted ceiling, giving the place a pleasing, yet spooky, symmetry. The highlight of the ossuary is a complete skeleton covered in gold that hangs at the front of the chapel. The practice of moving bones from cemetery plots into ossuaries after a period of time in the ground (usually seven to ten years) was common throughout Catholic Europe until recently. The bones in this ossuary are the remains of 1,245 monks whose bones were displaced when the ossuary was built. There are several other bone chapels in Portugal, the most famous being in Evora.  Go to the rear of the Igreja do Carmo church to find the Capela dos Ossos. Make sure to avoid siesta time (between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon) as it closes. As of a visit in March of 2018 there is no golden skeleton in sight, but the chapel still quite a thing to behold. Entrance ticket is two euros."
90,Rhinoceros of Belem Tower,"Lisbon, Portugal","A king's pet, a pope's gift, an artist's inspiration, and a tragic shipwreck.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/belem-tower-rhinoceros-torre-de-belem,"The first rhinoceros to set foot on European soil since Roman times did not last long. Surviving the 120-day sea voyage to Portugal, the rhino was a diplomatic gift from India. Arriving in 1515, the Indian rhinoceros was off-loaded near the construction site of the Tower of Belem in Lisbon. For a few months it was kept shackled and on display at king Manuel I’s Ribeira Palace, where it was used for less-than-sophisticated hijinks: The Portuguese attempted to make the rhino fight an elephant (the elephant wasn’t up for it, and walked off). Before long, Manuel grew tired of the rhino and decided to have it shipped off to Pope Leo X, whom he was buttering up for political favors. The year before, Manuel had sent Leo a hugely popular gift of a rare white elephant, which the pope kept as a pet and named Hanno. (Hanno died two years later of constipation—or rather of hair-brained “cures” for elephant constipation.) Tragically, the rhino never made it to Rome, drowning instead in a shipwreck off the coast of Northern Italy. Strangely, the short-lived rhino inspired a famous woodcut by the artist Albrecht Dürer, who never saw the animal in person. He based his illustration on secondhand descriptions and a sketch by an unknown artist. The resulting woodcut shows a magnificent beast in riveted armor. Real rhinos being in somewhat short order at the time, this fanciful interpretation of reality became known as “Dürer’s Rhinoceros” and went on to inspire dozens of paintings and sculptures across Europe. Meanwhile, the beautiful Tower of Belem was being built as the third in a series of fortifications designed to protect the natural port of Lisbon. Constructed between 1514 and 1520 of local lioz limestone, the tower is an example of the distinctive Portuguese “Manueline” style, named for King Manuel I. The style incorporates motifs inspired by the great Age of Discovery and the recent return of Vasco de Gama from explorations to the Far East. Design elements from Morocco, Venice, and India mingle with nautical symbols like rope. The entrance to the tower is marked with carvings of armillary spheres representing Manuel’s support of exploration. The turrets are decorated with carvings of exotic beasts. At the base of one of the turrets, stone carvers immortalized the rhinoceros they saw in 1515, now well worn, but notably lacking the armor of Dürer’s interpretation. The 100-foot tall tower survived the disastrous earthquake of 1755, and has been restored many times. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

91,Caza das Vellas Loreto,"Lisbon, Portugal",This charming candle shop has been in business since 1789.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/caza-das-vellas-loreto,"It’s easy to walk through the streets of Lisbon and pay more attention to not tripping on an errant stone on the narrow sidewalk than to any given shop. In this way, Lisbon keeps its secrets safe. One of the hidden gems it holds is a candle shop that has been open since 1789. Given its age, it’s no wonder Caza das Vellas Loreto is among the oldest operating candle shops in the world. The store’s been selling its waxy goods since July 14, 1789—coincidentally, the same day the French Revolution ignited. Caza das Vellas Loreto has remained in the same family for seven generations. You can feel the history in the quiet simplicity of the old wood-paneled display cases and the clock above the door that leads back into the storerooms. Visiting the store makes you wonder what life looked like in Lisbon not long after the devastating earthquake of 1755 destroyed most of the city. It’s easy to imagine this little shop helped light the way forward.  If you go, don't be surprised if you have to wait in line for a bit. They are popular with locals picking up candles for baptism or birthdays or religious celebrations."
92,Igreja de São Francisco,"Porto, Portugal",The stunning interior of this Gothic church is covered in ornate gold details.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/igreja-de-sao-francisco,"The Igreja de São Francisco (Church of Saint Francis) in Porto, Portugal boasts fabulous Baroque features. It was founded by the Franciscan friars as part of their convent, one of the oldest in Portugal, and dates back to the 13th century. Its interior is decorated with intricate carved panels, all covered with a layer of gold leaf. It’s a breathtaking work of art that took several decades to complete. The magnificent building hasn’t always rocked these extravagant gold accessories. It received its precious metal makeover in the 1700s between centuries of turbulence. During the Napoleonic invasions of the early 19th century, the friars fled and the convent was occupied by the invading troops. They plundered the church, taking with them some panels, and to add even further insult, used the church as a stable. Decades later, during the Portuguese Civil War, the city of Porto suffered a severe siege. The convent, occupied by the garrison that defended the city, was bombarded and suffered a serious fire. But the church was saved. It was used as warehouse near the seaport until the beginning of the 20th century. Today, the church houses a museum and still contains its prized features, including its sculpture of Jesus’ family tree. Known as the “Gold Church,” it has been completely restored. The exuberance of its decor is so great that it has been impressing visitors and foreigners for centuries (though people should take a break from admiring the dazzling decorations to check out the catacombs). The church is located in the historic center of Porto and several buses stop in front of the door in Infante Dom Henrique Square. It's also possible to go by tram since the end of Line 1 finishes straight ahead. The walking tour, however, is the most recommended. The church is close to other touristic sights, five minutes from Ribeira and 15 minutes from Aliados Avenue and Porto-São Bento Railway Station. There is also a smaller church next to Igreja de São Francisco, under which is an interesting crypt."
93,Covão dos Conchos,Portugal,This gaping hole in the middle of a remote mountain lake looks like a portal to another dimension.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/covao-dos-conchos,"Despite its appearance, the surreal-looking opening in Portugal’s Lagoa da Serra da Estrela is actually not a portal to any other time or place, but rather a manmade funnel leading into a long tunnel. Though it looks like a natural sinkhole lined with cascading waterfalls, Covão dos Conchos is, in fact, a wonder of engineering. This lake in the Serra da Estrela mountains was artificially created in 1955 during the construction of the nearby hydroelectric dam. Instead of building a pipeline to channel water between Lagoa Serra da Estrela and Lagoa Comprida, the engineers working on the project decided to drill a tunnel through the mountain to connect the two lakes. The spillway is designed to provide nearby communities with fresh water, but the fact that no other constructions are present nearby makes the funnel seem more like a part of the lake than a part of an infrastructure project. What’s more, there are plants growing around the edges of the concrete and granite drain pipe, making the giant hole look even more natural. This sci-fi-looking spillway was a little-known secret in Portugal until photos of the hole went viral in 2016.  Covão dos Conchos is located in the Serra da Estrela natural park and is far from any big city. The hike leading to the spillway starts at Lake Comprida and is around 6 miles (10 km) long. A detailed description of the hike can be found here. Be sure to bring plenty of water and wear good shoes."
94,Santa Justa Lift,"Lisbon, Portugal","This Industrial Age architectural and engineering gem helps visitors and residents alike traverse Lisbon, “The City of Seven Hills.”",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/santa-justa-lift,"Hills: they’re great to look at and to look from, but climbing them can be a drag. For a city like Lisbon — which has, according to its well-worn nickname, no fewer than seven hills comprising its setting — this has long been a consideration when designing intracity transportation systems. The Santa Justa Lift is a gorgeous fin de siècle solution to this problem that is still in use to this day. In the heart of Lisbon, the lower Baixa Pombalina district is separated from the higher Bairro Alto by a sudden elevation change of 45 meters (147 feet). As early as the 1870s, a lift system was proposed to facilitate the climb. First consisting of an animal-powered inclined rail lift, work began in 1900 to replace that with a vertical elevator. Inaugurated by King Carlos in 1901 and fully operational in 1902, the Santa Justa Lift has been shuttling people up and down ever since. The elegant Neo-Gothic iron tower was designed by Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard, an engineer from Porto who was a student of Gustave Eiffel. Originally powered by a steam engine, the elevator motor was converted to cleaner electric operation in 1907. Lisbon still has some older funiculars (i.e., inclined tramways) still in operation, but Santa Justa is the only remaining vertical urban lift. Today, the Santa Justa Lift operates almost 16 hours a day, seven days a week, with one of its two steampunky wood-and-brass cars departing every few minutes. A platform above the upper terminus can be reached by a spiral staircase, where one can find a cafe offering commanding views of Rossio Square, the Baixa, and some of the cool stuff (like a castle!) on Lisbon’s other six hills.  The queue for the elevator can be insanely long, but the platform can easily be reached by walking around and up the hill at the back (this also takes you past the Carmo convent ruins). The lift can then be taken down with hardly any queue."
95,Drowned Village of Vilarinho da Furna,Portugal,A submerged village appears when dam levels drop.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vilarinho-da-fuma,"In a rare occurrence, during a particularly dry spell in Portugal’s Minho region, Vilarinho da Furna emerges from beneath the water to reveal the bare walls of a 2000-year-old town destroyed by an electric company. In 1967, construction began on a dam that would flood areas of the River Homem, and provide massive hydroelectricity to the region. Amid some protest, the Portuguese Electricity Company paid off residents to leave their homes, as the dam would completely submerge the small village of 300 people. In 1971, the last resident left the town, and its barren structures awaited the deluge that would bury it beneath the river. In 1972, the town was submerged, plunging over 2000 years of history in the village into water. According to oral accounts, the town was founded by Romans in the 1st century C.E., and was prosperous throughout its history. Today, the barren walls, windows and doors rise mysteriously when the dam water levels fall. A museum dedicated to the lost city was built in nearby São João do Campo, and other commemoration efforts have taken place since the town was flooded 40 years ago. Recently, boats with transparent bottoms have also taken tourists near the village so the remains of the city can be seen and the history not lost forever. It is possible to find locals to take you on the lake in a boat, but no one goes near the end with the ruins. Since water levels fluctuate, it can be very dangerous for boats. Unless you dive on your own or arrive during a drought, you will probably not see the ruins. The area has beautiful hiking and walking paths."
96,McDonald's Imperial,"Porto, Portugal",This restored Portuguese cafe may well be the most beautiful place in the world to grab a Big Mac.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mcdonalds-imperial,"Fast food and fine decor don’t always go hand in hand, but at Porto’s former Imperial Cafe, the two come together in what is often called the “most beautiful McDonald’s in the world.” It opened in 1995 in the space previously occupied by the famous Portuguese coffeeshop, which was an icon in the 1930s. The building retained many of the original Art Deco features including the ornate ceilings, chandeliers, and a large stained glass wall, which is currently behind the counter. It is unclear if the staircases are original, but they have been constructed to complement the style of the interiors. Outside is the massive eagle which was the symbol of the old Imperial. People often visit to snap pictures of the unlikely but amazing synthesis.  The public transport system in Porto is good including a modern light rail system (runs underground in city centre, best station Aliados) and a historic tramway as well as numerous tourist buses. The main rail station is a couple of minutes away."
97,Corvin Castle,"Hunedoara, Romania",This fairy-tale castle would make Dracula (who is said to have been imprisoned there) jealous.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/corvin-castle,"In the heart of Transylvania, one of Europe’s largest castles looks like it sits atop a rocky bluff with nothing but a thin bridge allowing access. But this is Corvin Castle, which looks like something straight out of a fairytale, largely because restorers thought that it should. Built in the mid-15th century, the castle was the work of military leader John Hunyadi, who constructed the tall structure over the remains of a keep built by Charles I. Corvin Castle is split into three large areas: The Knight’s Hall, the Diet Hall, and the circular stairways. Each of these three parts is surrounded by both circular and rectangular towers that were used for both defense and as a prison. The elaborate architecture was designed in a rich gothic style that accentuates the already impressive structure. The castle was kept in regal condition during Hunyadi’s lifetime, but after he died, the castle fell into swift decline. It was not until the 17th century that there was more interest in restoring this medieval castle. As the restoration work began, the workers redesigned the castle to reflect what they considered a gothic castle should look like, which explains much of its currently fanciful look. A number of legends are associated with the castle. Though this is likely untrue, tourists are told that Vlad the Impaler spent some seven years in the dungeons of Corvin Castle, a stay which resulted in his eventual madness.  The Castle is open daily, from 10:30 AM to 8:30 PM on Mondays, and from 9:00 AM and 8:30 PM from Tuesday to Sunday. A normal ticket costs around €5, but the prices for students and elderly people are lower. Corvin Castle is an attraction included in the Romania: Castles, Ruins, and Medieval Villages trip."

Located in the Anina Mountains on the Mini River, the rounded waterfall is almost eight meters high, and falls over an unusual and dramatic green carpet of moss. Unlike more roaring falls, this waterwork flows over the apex of a fat, rounded stone, and is diverted into a sheet of countless small streams that issue from the bottom of the stone which juts out over the basin below. The otherworldly beauty of the site even earned it a place as the number one interesting waterfall in Romania. Update as of June 2021: The waterfall collapsed in part from natural causes.  Located in Anina Mountains, on the road between two cities: Oravita and Bozgovici, exactly on 45th parallel."
99,Salina Turda,"Turda, Romania",This massive underground salt mine now holds a sci-fi theme park in its depths.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/salina-turda,"With over 2,000 years of history, highly preserved galleries, and a futuristic underground attraction, Romania’s Salina Turda is the largest salt mine museum in the world, and easily the most incredible. Located in Turda, Transylvania, the site is a large underground wonderland with a brightly lit modern art theme park nestled 120 meters below the surface of the Earth inside one of the oldest salt mines ever known. Salt extraction on the site’s surface started in antiquity, but the work expanded underground during the Roman occupation of Dacia. The salt was extracted manually using pickaxes, hammers, chisels, and steel wedges, by free people who were paid in florins, ale, and loaves of bread. The mine was closed in 1932, but it was used again during World War II as a bomb shelter. After the war, the mine served several purposes, one of which was a warehouse for storing cheese. Regardless of its history, this salt mine is not just a huge museum, but an epic tourist attraction. It was even ranked by Business Insider as the most beautiful underground place in the world. The innovative look of this gargantuan amusement park seems like something out of a science fiction movie. It contains attractions like an amphitheater, an underground lake that may be explored with paddles and rowboats, a Ferris wheel, spa treatment rooms with natural aerosols, bowling alley, mini-golf, sports field, table tennis, pool tables. Salina Turda is one of the most stunning places anywhere on or in the planet.

100,Hoia-Baciu Forest,"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","Some call this eerie forest of crooked trees the ""Bermuda Triangle of Romania.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hoia-baciu-forest,"Warped trees fill this forest, their skeletal figures twisting and spiraling, making it seem as though they’re contorting themselves to reach out and touch you. An eerie silence fills the air, interrupted only by the footsteps of unseen figures. Given its eerie atmosphere, it’s no wonder the Hoia-Baciu Forest is said to be one of the most haunted forests in the world. As such, it’s a place that lends well to stories steeped with darkness. Some even call it the “Bermuda Triangle of Romania.” According to local legends, ghosts and spirits lurk among the crooked trees. One tale tells of a young girl who disappeared into the forest, only to reappear five years later unable to remember where she had been. Another legend speaks of a shepherd who, along with his sheep, vanished within the woods. And, with most places associated with the supernatural, there are also rumors of alien encounters. Of course, the forest has so much more to offer than just a dark thrill. It’s a perfectly pleasant recreation area, letting locals and visitors take a break from urban Cluj-Napoca. There are hiking and biking paths that wind through the unusual trees, and the woods teem with a rich variety of animal life.  Please be respectful of the environment and stick to the set trails. Local guides frequently offer both daytime and nighttime tours."
101,Bran Castle,"Bran, Romania","The possible imprisonment of Vlad the Impaler here earned the medieval castle its nickname, ""Dracula's Castle.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bran-castle,"In the center of Romania is a medieval castle believed to have once held  Vlad Tepes Dracula, commonly known as “Vlad the Impaler” as a prisoner. The infamous Romanian ruler was immortalized as the inspiration for Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel, “Dracula,”.  The novel is believed to be inspired by the Romanian folklore lady serial killer Countess Elizabeth Bathory. Thanks to this loose link to the famous vampire, Bran Castle is popularly known in the region and beyond as “Dracula’s Castle.” Bran Castle was built between 1377 and 1388 atop a strategic site overlooking a heavily trafficked mountain pass between Transylvania and Wallachia, the land over which Vlad the Impaler ruled in the 15th century. Also known as Vlad III Dracula, the ruler is widely believed to be the inspiration for Count Dracula due to his historic bloodlust. He liked to torture people and would impale his enemies on the battlefield to deter his other enemies. During invasions, he was also known to use the scorched-earth policy, a military strategy that consists of destroying any possible resource that the enemy could use by poisoning water supplies and burning crops. Although the famous Wallachian ruler might have passed several times near Bran, there is no historical document attesting that he ever visited it. His visits to Transylvania were usually related to the boyars of Brașov. After his first reign, when he was sent into exile, he wanted to settle in Brașov, but John Hunyadi forbade them to provide him with shelter. The castle is owned by the descendants of Queen Marie, to whom it was given 1920 as a token of appreciation for her efforts to unify Romania. After her death, Bran Castle was inherited by her daughter, Princess Ileana, who ran it as a hospital during World War II. In 1948 the castle was seized by the Communist regime, but it was returned to Dominic von Habsburg, Princess Ileana’s son, in 2006. Currently, Bran is open as a museum, largely devoted to Queen Marie of Romania. The castle is also a popular location for Halloween events, like the 2016 competition to win the chance to stay in the castle Halloween night, retracing the steps of Jonathan Harker from the opening pages of Bram Stoker’s novel. Bram Stoker never visited central Europe, and there are other castles with more solid claims on Dracula’s legend, but underground passages and ancient weapons and armor, and not to mention all the creepy sounds the medieval building makes, make the Bran Castle an experience worthy of the vampire’s name."
102,Peleș Castle,"Sinaia, Romania","This elaborately decorated, fairytale-like Romanian royal palace is one of the most striking castles in Europe.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/peles-castle,"When King Carol I of Romania visited the small village of Sinaia in the foothills of the Bucegi mountains in the 1860s, he was captivated by its scenic location and commissioned the construction of a palace there. The resulting castle is easily one of the most stunning in all of Europe. The construction took 10 years, but by the end of it, the Romanian royals had a summer palace equipped with everything from a movie theater to a concert hall. The ornate 160-room palace was built in a Neo-Renaissance style and each room had its own identity and theme. After its inauguration in 1883, the king and his family began spending their summers in the fairytale castle, which also served as the venue for important meetings during the early months of World War I. The first couple to live there, King Carol I and his wife Queen Elizabeth of Romania were known to be very different in temperament and interests. The king was an accomplished soldier who greatly expanded and improved the Romanian military, and the queen was more artistic, with a great fondness for music, art, and literature, and even published poetry under the pen name Carmen Sylva. Peleș, too, was a reflection of these two different personalities. On one hand, there was an extensive 4,000-piece collection of weaponry from Europe and Asia on display in the Weapons Room. On the other, there was a beautifully appointed movie theater, whose walls and ceilings were decorated with frescoes by Austrian artists Gustav Klimt and Franz von Matsch. The first movie projection in Romania is reported to have taken place in this room. Other art forms were far from neglected. The Music Room contained intricate pieces of teak furniture gifted by the Indian Maharajah of Kapurtala and was used as a salon by Queen Elizabeth. King Carol’s successor, King Ferdinand built a smaller version of this grand palace right next door to it and named it Pelișor. When Romania fell under Communist rule, Peleș, along with other royal properties, were seized, and the castle was closed between 1975 and 1990. Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu had his eye on it as potential protocol residence but this plan was thwarted by the caretakers of the castle who told him that fungus was growing inside and this would be detrimental for its residents. After the revolution of 1989, it was reopened to the public as a museum.  You can take the train from Brașov or Bucharest to the stop in Sinaia. The castle is within walking distance, though taking a taxi may be preferable. Tickets have two price points: one for touring the first floor only, and one for touring both floors. There is also an additional fee for taking photographs inside the castle. During its winter schedule, between September 14th and May 14th, the castle is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. During the summer schedule, the castle is closed only on Mondays. Peleș Castle is included in the Romania: Castles, Ruins, and Medieval Villages trip."
103,Snagov Monastery,"Snagov Island, Romania",This solitary monastery may hold the remains of Vlad the Impaler (but probably not).,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/snagov-monastery,"On a tiny island in a lake just outside of Bucharest stands Snagov Monastery which local tradition states is the burial place of Vlad the Impaler, the inspiration for Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Originally founded in the 14th century and later excavated in 1933, the monastery is a seemingly simple place of worship taking advantage of the calm its water-locked isolation brings. However, the story goes that after his notoriously cruel lifetime, Vlad Tepes III was buried in the church as per his request prior to his death. A number of archeologists and historians have worked to verify whether this tale is fact or simple apocrypha and none have been able to prove that the dictator was ever laid to rest on the island. After having dug up some of the site’s burial stones all that was found were a mix of horse and human bones, but nothing that confirms the possible Dracula’s interment. Most historians now believe that the Prince of Wallachia was buried in a monastery in the Comana area, but this has not stopped the locals from spreading the spurious myth. A footbridge has been built to the island and visitors are encouraged to stop by the Snagov Monastery and view the supposed grave.  However, the caretakers now charge anyone who wants to take pictures. The Romanian government even began plans to capitalize on the church’s unverifiable history by building an amusement park in Snagov called “Dracula Park” although development was mercifully canceled in 2006."
104,The Merry Cemetery,"Săpânța, Romania",A small town Romanian cemetery filled with darkly humorous gravestones.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/merry-cemetery,"When someone dies, their memory generally enters a kind of idealized state in the minds of those who loved them. Their flaws are forgiven and forgotten, and the way in which they passed (especially if it was unpleasant) often goes unspoken. Only the sweet stories about the person are retold. On their tombstone generalized niceties are written, often reduced to as little as “Rest in Peace.” Not so in the town of Săpânţa, Romania, where at the Cimitirul Vesel or “Merry Cemetery,” over 800 wooden crosses bear the life stories, dirty details, and final moments of the bodies they mark. Displayed in bright, cheery pictures and annotated with limericks are the stories of almost everyone who has died of the town of Săpânţa. Illustrated crosses depict soldiers being beheaded and a townsperson being hit by a truck. The epigraphs reveal a surprising level of truth. “Underneath this heavy cross. Lies my mother in law poor… Try not to wake her up. For if she comes back home. She’ll bite my head off.” Stan Ioan Pătraş was born in Săpânţa in 1908, and at the age of 14 he had already begun carving crosses for the local cemetery. By 1935, Pătraş had begun carving clever or ironic poems—done in a rough local dialect—about the deceased, as well as painting the crosses with the deceased’s image, often including the way in which the individual died in the image. Stan Ioan Pătraş soon developed a careful symbolism in his work. Green represented life, yellow represented fertility, red for passion, black for death. The colors were always set against a deep blue, known as Săpânţa blue, which Pătraş believed represented hope, freedom, and the sky. Other symbolism—white doves for the soul, a blackbird to represent a tragic or suspicious death—worked their way onto the crosses, as did Pătraş’s dark sense of humor. Săpânţa is a small town with few secrets, and often the dirty details of the deceased made it onto the crosses. One reads “Ioan Toaderu loved horses. One more thing he loved very much. To sit at a table in a bar. Next to someone else’s wife.” The deceased town drunk has a grave showing a black skeleton dragging him down while he swigs from a bottle, noted in his epitaph as “real poison.” Pătraş singlehandedly carved, wrote poems for, and painted well over 800 of these folk art masterpieces over a period of 40 years. It wasn’t until near the end of his life, in the early 1970s, that the merry cemetery, as the town has dubbed it, was discovered by the outside world when a French journalist publicized it. Stan Ioan Pătraş died in 1977, having carved his own cross and left his house and work to his most talented apprentice, Dumitru Pop. Pop has since spent the last three decades continuing the work, carving the cemetery’s crosses, and has turned Stan’s house into the merry cemetery’s workshop-museum. He picks an oak for the grave slabs and fells the tree by himself. One famous epitaph reads: Underneath this heavy cross  / Lies my mother-in-law poor  / Had she lived three days more  / I would be here and she would read / You that are passing by / Try not to wake her up  / For if she comes back home  / She’ll bite my head off / But I will act in the way  / That she will not return  / Stay here my dear  Mother-in-law. Despite the occasionally dark comedy, or merely dark, tones of the crosses, Pop says no one has ever complained about the work. “It’s the real life of a person. If he likes to drink, you say that; if he likes to work, you say that… There’s no hiding in a small town… The families actually want the true life of the person to be represented on the cross.” Pop has one complaint about the work, that it can get repetitive. “Their lives were the same, but they want their epitaphs to be different.” Also, not all the carvings can be exhibited due to political reasons. A Romanian book called “The Crosses of Sapanta” lists all the epitaphs in the cemetery along with descriptions and insights into the meaning of the messages.  Drive in the direction of Siget. Once in Sapanta, in the middle of the town, you have to turn right. There is a signpost to tell you exactly where."
105,Poenari Castle,"Wallachia, Romania","The legendary cliffside castle of three-time Voivode of Wallachia, Vlad the Impaler.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/poenari-castle-vlad-the-impaler,"Even without its bloody historic ties, Poenari Castle, also known as Poenari Fortress, would be a majestic, exciting place to explore on its own merit. Architecture buffs would marvel at the 13th century mortar work, lovers of fantastic scenery would find the cliffside view mind-blowing. Poenari Castle doesn’t need a sordid story to be spectacular, but it happens to have that as well. The story is a legendary one and to many, a confusing mixture of truth, history, legend, and fiction due to the convolution between the novel “Dracula” and the factual history of Vlad III Dracula “The Impaler”, whose name inspired the book. Bram Stoker modeled some of his main character on the more basic facts about Dracula’s actual life, but his knowledge of Romanian history and the true story of Vlad the Impaler remains suspect. The true Dracula, (Turk-impaling Prince of Wallachia as opposed to the sultry blood sucker) fell in love with Poenari Castle in the 15th century, and realizing its potential as a major stronghold with an amazing vantage point, consolidated and fixed up the crumbling fortress, making it one of his main places of residence. It’s said that his first wife, whose name is debated among historians, flung herself from the towers of Poenari during a siege by Vlad’s muslim brother, Radu Bey. Before flinging herself into the Arges River below, she exclaimed she would rather rot and be eaten by the fish than to be a captive of the Turks. In the end the walls of Poenari would not keep Dracul the Dragon safe, but it was not the fortress that failed him. Vlad’s brother Radu cel Frumos was given the daunting task of leading the Ottoman Empire to victory, which positioned him directly at odds with his infamously brutal older brother. While Vlad could not be defeated in battle, his habit of alienating allies and undermining their authority became his downfall. After running out of money for his mercenaries, he went to his supposed friends for help, and they quickly betrayed him, and had him arrested for high treason. While he managed to untangle himself and went on to declare a third reign, it was an uphill battle that eventually killed him, and he never returned to his castle on the hill. Poenari Castle is located on the right side of the Transfăgărăşan road in Argeş County, on a cliff near the Făgăraş Mountains. In 1888, a landslide brought a portion of the fortress crashing down the cliff, but otherwise the structure has been mildly maintained and can still be visited today, but there is quite a climb to reach the ruins – over 1,000 steps. Update as of June 2022: Currently closed for renovations.  There are tour buses that go directly to the castle from Bucarest. If you'd like to go on your own, the closest town is Arefu, the closest modern town is Curtea de Arges. From Curtea de Arges, you can catch a minibus to Arefu, and let the driver know you are headed for Poenari Castle. They will get you as close as possible, but there is no town too nearby the castle, so it's a walk. There are signs, and a small but bustling tourist area with an inn, gift shop and the like to help lead the way."

It was turned into a general store and later abandoned and left to decay as Communism collapsed. The grandson of the banker, who originally bought the building back in 1903 requested that it would be returned to his family, as legal heirs. It took 24 years of battles in court, untangling bureaucratic loops, and finding the proper documents in archives, but he finally took possession of the decaying building in 2007. He then began its remarkable transformation to the Cărturești Carusel (“Carousel of Light”) bookstore that stands today. The extensive renovation went above and beyond, creating a stunning shop considered to be one of the most beautiful bookstores in Romania, and even the world. Seventy-five people put in a combined 20,000 hours of work over the course of five years, rebuilding and customizing every bit of detail. The store’s three floors spread across more than 10,000 square feet that hold as many books. There are elegantly curved balconies on each of the upper levels, a large open space in the middle, and a teahouse on the top floor that offers a great view of the entire bookstore.  Open Monday through Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Thursday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.; and Friday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to midnight To avoid the crowds, it's best to visit in the morning hours."

It’s a magical, romantic place to discover. Glittering light filters through the trees, streaking the air and dappling the earth, giving the railway a mesmerizing photographic charm. Despite its recently acquired official European recognition, the tunnel remains relatively unknown among the public. The “Tunnel of Love” (Romania’s version of the famously beautiful Ukrainian tunnel) feels like an open secret shared among soon-to-be-married couples and photographers with a keen sense for scoping out special spots. The railway is a secondary non-electrified railway that was inaugurated between 1908 and 1909. After it was abandoned, nature began reclaiming the space. Trees and shrubs began stretching skyward, eventually forming a tunnel above the old metal tracks. Reaching the tunnel is part of the allure. Excitement builds as you reach the small commune of Obreja, which you’ll quickly pass through only to leave the quaint houses and old church behind to drive into the sprawling countryside. Only when you spot the dirt path along the side of the road will you know you’re on the right path to discovering the tunnel, which has been hiding in plain sight all along.  As you leave western Romanian city of Caransebes, go east along the country road No. 68 (DN68). You need to be on look out for a crossroad with an old railway, which is quietly touching the outskirts of the village only to dissolve itself into the forest nearby which seems to follow, almost unseen, the house lines on the horizon. Take the dirt path toward the distant forest on your right. You will eventually discover the rusty rails that will lead you to the Tunnel of Love, just laying there waiting to be photographed!"
108,Constanța Casino,"Constanța, Romania","Once an opulent Art Nouveau hotspot, the Constanța Casino is one of Romania's most beautiful abandoned buildings.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casino-constanta,"Originally commissioned by King Carol I around 1900, the Casino first opened to the public in 1910. Commanding a dramatic location right on the waterfront of the Black Sea overlooking the ancient port at Constanța, the Casino was a triumph of the Art Nouveau movement, and quickly became the symbol of the city. Worsening circumstances in Romania over the 20th century saw it gradually fall into disrepair, briefly used as a hospital during World War II and eventually repurposed by the communist regime as a restaurant. Maintaining the elaborate structure quickly became prohibitively expensive, and the building was closed in 1990. Despite occasional efforts at restoration, it’s remained abandoned ever since. While it’s nominally owned by the municipality and technically closed to the public, Romanian authorities have never shown much interest in enforcing the closure. There are a lot of legends and secrets about how the casino was built. One such legend claims that Constanța Casino was built by a navigator whose daughter died young, at 17 years old.

109,Decebal's Head,"Dubova, Romania",A giant portrait of an ancient king looms over the river.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/decebals-head,"This 40-meter-tall bearded stone face overlooking the Danube River looks like something straight from Middle Earth. In reality, it’s the recent creation of a Romanian businessman. Decebal (Decebalus the Brave One) was the last king of Dacia. He was also one of the mightiest rulers of this ancient kingdom. After reuniting fragmented Dacian tribes, he fought three wars against two Roman emperors before finally succumbing to the power of Rome in 106. The national identity of modern Romania is still firmly rooted in its ancient Dacian heritage. This monumental stone portrait of Decebal is the brainchild of Iosif Constantin Dragan, a businessman and historian. It’s situated on the Romanian side of Danube, right opposite the Tabula Traiana, a memorial to the Roman conquest of Dacia. At 40 meters, it is is the tallest rock sculpture in Europe and took 10 years (from 1994 to 2004) for a team of 12 sculptors to complete. Inscription on the statue is, somewhat ironically, written in Latin—the language introduced to Romania by Decebal’s enemies. It reads “DECEBALUS REX - DRAGAN FECIT” (“King Decebal - Made by Dragan”)."
110,The Mountain Sphinx,"Bușteni, Romania",Conspiracy theories and occult legends surround this mysterious natural rock formation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mountain-sphinx-bu-teni-romania,"In the Bucegi Mountains of Romania there lies a rock formation shrouded in mystery and conspiracy theories. From a certain angle, its outline resembles that of Egypt’s Great Sphinx of Giza. The odd formation is one of the “Seven Wonders of Romania.” Over millions of years, the elements carved the nearly 40-foot-tall rock until it resembled something akin to a woman’s face. But the figure’s human-like appearance isn’t the main attraction that draws people to it. The Mountain Sphinx (also known as the Sphinx of Bușteni) is a hotbed of folklore and conspiracy theories. Some say it’s a strong energetic force field, one of the Earth’s supposed chakras. Others say an ancient civilization carved it to represent some sort of supreme god. And, as with most mysterious places, there are people who claim aliens are somehow involved. Still others say it sits atop a cave guarded by an impenetrable force field, which may possibly hold anything from a library to an abandoned uranium mine to crystals containing all of humankind’s knowledge. People have even gone so far as to claim that the CIA and Romanian secret forces have attempted to penetrate whatever treasures the rock allegedly guards. Whether you decide to believe any of the legends or not, the Sphinx will still be there waiting, perched atop the mountain as it has been for millennia. And as for the supposed energy field, you’ll just have to feel it for yourself!  There are several hiking trails (of varying difficulty) to get here, leaving from the towns of Bușteni and Sinaia. You can also take the cable car up, but be aware of its opening and closing times, and that it will stop functioning in hazardous weather!"
111,The Sinca Veche Temple Cave,"Șinca, Romania",No one knows who built this strange cave of worship or exactly why.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-sinca-veche-temple-cave-inca-romania,"The mysterious cave on the outskirts of the Romanian village of Sinca Veche goes by many names. “The Sinca Veche Temple Cave,” “The Monastery,” “The Temple of Destiny,” but no matter what you call it, the origins and purpose of this underground chapel is just as enigmatic. While the original builders of the Sinca Veche monastery cave are unknown, the site has been dated to around 7,000 years old. Regardless of who originally built out the space, it has been home to a number of different religious tenants, as evidenced by the strange melange of disparate religious symbols that have been carved into the walls of the temple. You can find a Star of David here, a Chinese yin-yang symbol there, but strangely no Christian crosses, despite the fact that there is other evidence of Christian habitation. The monastery is composed of nine different rooms, two of which act as separate chapels. Light enters the cave from a series of low windows and tall, chimney-like skylights. It has been speculated that these shafts were also there to symbolically let holy energy into the space. There is also speculation that there is a hidden tunnel that connects to a nearby fortress. Visitors can explore the mysterious church at their leisure and try and solve the mystery for themselves, but with 7,000 years of history behind it, your chances are pretty slim."
112,Râpa Roșie,"Municipiul Sebeș, Romania","Romania's ""Red Ravine"" is a little-known natural wonder that bears a resemblance to the Grand Canyon.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rapa-rosie,"Romania’s beautiful landscape features the Carpathian Mountains, the Danube Delta, and miles of coastline along the Black Sea. But one spot, just outside Sebeș, is interrupted by a jagged red anomaly. The city is guarded by the steep walls of the Râpa Roșie (Red Ravine), a geological reserve on the most southwesterly part of the Secaşelor Plateau. Over the last 60 million years, water has carved deep into the gravel, sandstone, and quartz of the plateau’s sublayer, creating unusual natural spiked towers and pyramid shapes in the red clay. The result is often compared to the Grand Canyon, though it’s not quite as massive; the ravine’s tallest peaks are about 300 feet. It is also ever-evolving: Heavy rains cause noticeable changes to the folds in the uniquely steep slopes. The Red Ravine remains relatively unknown, even to those who have lived nearby for years. There are however local tales of World War I soldiers passing through the ravine in order to get to Alba Iulia, where, at the end of the war, representatives declared the union of Transylvania and Romania. In 1950, the area, which is home to many rare and endemic plants and some of the largest caves in the world, was declared a natural monument. Thanks to its obscurity, and consequential lack of visitors, the ravine remains in beautiful shape. Easiest access is by car or taxi, but the road isn't fully marked on GPS or maps. Walking to the ravine from Sebeș is also possible; just be aware of the many stray dogs in the area. Stay a while and do the suggested hiking loop around the ravine!"
113,Dargavs Village,"Dargavs, Russia",This ancient village and its adjoining cemetery have a beautiful history of death and remembrance.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dargavs-village-city-of-the-dead,"Reaching this mystifying destination requires a three-hour drive, taking you down a dangerous and hidden road befitting a journey to the City of the Dead. The village of Dargavs, or the City of the Dead, has an ancient cemetery where people that lived in the valley buried their loved ones along with their clothes and belongings. The valley stretches for 17 kilometers, and the cemetery contains almost 100 ancient stone crypts. Ossetians say that the cemetery helps them understand how people lived 400 years ago. Archeologists, also, are very interested in exploring the site more completely, as there have been interesting items found that have attracted some scientific attention. It is a very mysterious place with a lot of myths and legends. It was once believed that if anyone tried to get to the city they would never emerge alive. Local legends have it that in the 18th century a plague swept through Ossetia. The clans built quarantine houses for sick family members, who were provided with food but not the freedom to move about until death claimed their lives. People who did not have any remaining family members to bury them would just wait in the massive cemetery until their death. It was a very slow and painful way to go, and in the City of Death they stay. It attracts tourists from nearby as well as all over the world, although due to the difficulty in finding or traveling to the location there are not a lot of tourists at any given time. The local superstitions probably have little to do with the lack of popularity, although they do still linger. Locals bemoan the young generation’s attraction to bright cities, contending that the young are missing out on a lot. Russia has a lot of truly unique places to offer but these historic sites do not attract much attention. If, however, one spends some time in North Ossetia, they say it’s possible to feel the ancient vibes around the city and its surrounding area. Once you get to the city you will find what at first appear to be lots of little white houses but are actually stone crypts, the oldest dating back to the 16th century. In front of every crypt there is a well that was used to tell if a person made it to heaven. Visitors drop a coin into the well, and if the coin happened to hit a stone at the bottom of the well, it was said to be a good sign.  Interesting fact is that this region is a historical region of another people called Ingushetians which live today in a reduced area called ""Republic of Ingushetia"" only few miles from there. They lost more than a half of their territory since Russia came to this region in favor of Ossetians and Kazaks. Most of names of this region can be translated only from Ingush language which is often hidden by Ossetian policy of assimilation.  Each crypt belongs to one family or clan."
114,Bunker-42,"Moscow, Russia",Dr. Strangelove-esque tours reveal the inside a bunker once reserved for Stalin himself.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bunker-42,"There’s an amazing tunnel system snaking beneath the streets of Moscow, leading to a secret cold war fortress once code named “Bunker-42.” Designed and built after the first series of nuclear tests by the Soviet Union, these tests revealed that the optimum depth for the bunker’s silo must be no higher than 165 feet beneath ground in order to survive nuclear fallout intact. The task for the builders was enormous: construct a gigantic structure beneath the city streets without damaging Moscow’s existing infrastructure of streets and communication pathways. To do so would alert the public and innumerable unknown spies to the existence of the bunker, thereby rendering the entire (read: top-secret) thing useless. Strategically located inside a hill in the Tagansky district due to its proximity to the Kremlin, allowing quick access to the bunker for Stalin and the premier tier of government officials within the USSR, Bunker-42 wasn’t completed until 1956 and was thankfully never put into use in its full capacity. Rather, it spent the subsequent three decades as an airstrike command base, communicating with aircraft transporting strategic bombers carrying nuclear weapons until the political climate began to shift in 1986. Today, the space exists as a historical monument that is equal parts museum to what life was like on the Soviet side of the Iron Curtain during the Cold War era and tour of the previously top-secret bunker itself, bringing visitors below ground to a time when the world lived on the constant brink of nuclear annihilation. A variety of tour packages are available at all hours of the day, catering to a range of ages, some of which focus more on the historical aspects of the space, while other take a nearly comic angle on the tangible threat of nuclear annihilation for all humankind.  The bunker is only accessible through a scheduled tour. Look for the three-story yellow house with a green gate and red star."
115,Izmailovo Kremlin,"Moscow, Russia","Moscow's other, lesser known kremlin is a fairytale-like cultural complex modeled after Old Russia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/izmailovo-kremlin,"As the symbol of the Russian state, the Kremlin in Moscow’s Red Square is famed and celebrated. But there is a second, less known Kremlin in the northeast part of the city. Located near the Serebryano-Vinogradny Pond, the Kremlin in the city’s Izmailovo District is an unexpected, fairytale-like cultural wonderland. Kremlin is the Russian word for citadel or fortress, and they are found in many Russian cities. But the Izmailovo Kremlin, a wooden complex completed in 2007, was not built for protection as its name suggests. It was established as a cultural center and marketplace loosely modeled after traditional Russian architecture and fairytale depictions of Old Russia. Wander about and you will spot the Romanov emblem of a crowned griffin decorating everything from buildings to fences, as well as a pink statue of Lenin which has caused some mild outrage. The colorful and bustling complex is home to several single-subject museums. One is dedicated to Russian folk art, another to bread, and yet another to vodka. It includes a wooden replica of the summer palace of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich, where visitors can experience a traditional Russian meal. It is also home to the Church of St. Nicholas, named after the patron saint of crafts and trade, which at 151 feet in height is the tallest wooden church in the country. Next to the Kremlin is the Izmailovo District’s landmark open-air market, which dates back to the 17th century, when it was an avant-garde market selling original paintings, crafts, and wares. The market is now connected to the Izmailovo Kremlin by a wooden bridge. Taking the appearance of a town, with roofed stalls lining a maze of walkways, it is divided into two tiers: the Vernissage for souvenirs and traditional handicrafts, and the flea market for all else. The bazaar is attended by merchants from regions all over Russia and is a favored shopping destination for locals and tourists alike, brimming with items ranging from books, baskets, retro toys and furniture to Soviet memorabilia, fur hats, nesting dolls, and traditional artwork. Entering the Izmailovo Kremlin is like stepping back in time. Most popular during the summer and on weekends, the complex and its labyrinthine market space are equally charming during quiet, uncrowded hours. Access to the Izmailovo Kremlin and Market is easy, with Partizanskaya metro station a 10-minute walk away. Alternatively, you can use the Izmailovo station of Moscow Central Circle (MCC). The Kremlin is busy during the day and much quieter in the evening. The inner court is very well lit after dark, unlike the outside."
116,Psychedelic Salt Mines,"Yekaterinburg, Russia",It's hard to believe the dizzying patterns covering this abandoned mine are completely natural.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/psychedelic-salt-mines,"All the loud beats and techno lights in Moscow on a Saturday night don’t hold a flame to the mind-bending natural formations found 650 feet below the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, about 1,000 miles to the east. The surreal swirls are caused by layers of the mineral carnallite, which can be yellow and white or even red and blue. They paint rivers of color across the walls of this abandoned salt mine, dating back millions of years to when a salty sea dried up, leaving behind the mineral deposits. The long, winding tunnels of the salt mine, whose labyrinthine passageways stretch for miles, are now mostly abandoned and only accessible with a government permit. The first photos of the Yekaterinburg mine came to light thanks to the young Russian explorer-photographer Mikhail Mishainik, who even spent whole nights down in the dance clubby dungeons. Without a flashlight, the tunnels - some of which stretch for four miles - are pitch black, and the air is filled with tiny particles of salt, giving one’s throat a permanent sense of being parched. While it’s not open to the public, perhaps you can finagle a special permit, grab a few flashlights, go down a few hundred feet, and check it out for yourself. One imagines that bringing your own psychedelics is not necessary, nor encouraged.  You'll need to get a special government permit if you want to visit for yourself."
117,Lenin's Mausoleum,"Moscow, Russia",This building holds the embalmed remains of the leader of the Bolshevik Revolution.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lenins-mausoleum,"Lenin’s mausoleum in Red Square offers up one of Moscow’s most macabre attractions and perhaps the most famous “modern mummy” in the world. Frozen in time, Vladimir Ilych Lenin’s embalmed body lays within a red granite and black labradorite step-pyramid. Here visitors may gaze upon it in the dark, cool of the tomb. When Vladimir Ilych Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik Revolution, died on January 21, 1924, he did not believe he was going to an afterlife. He assumed that death was the ultimate end for him. How wrong he was. In his will, Vladimir Ilych Lenin requested he be laid to rest in the ground. Instead, he was embalmed and interred in a temporary wooden cube designed by architect Alexei Shchusev. His body was on display before his funeral and, while the government said they planned to bury him, the Russian people wouldn’t have it. The Russian government allegedly received over 10,000 telegrams from the grieving public asking for the body of great leader to be preserved in some way for the generations to come. In response to the public outcry, the permanent mausoleum was commissioned in 1929 to preserve Lenin’s remains for a longer period of time. The current mausoleum was unveiled in 1930, again designed by Shchusev. Lenin’s body remained here until it was evacuated to Tymen, Siberia (along with his embalmers, who worked to keep it “fresh”), since Moscow was under the threat of Nazi invasion. In March of 1945, a Soviet operation codenamed “Object No. 1” moved Lenin’s body back from Siberia to the Moscow mausoleum. To continue the preservation of Lenin’s body, a team of special embalmers (originally Ilya Zbarsky and his son Boris Zbarsky) is dedicated to Lenin’s corpse. Unfortunately, Lenin’s 85-year-old body still has a distinctive “wax-fruit” look to it, despite being warmly lighted to make him appear more lifelike. The sarcophagus is kept at a constant temperature of 16 degrees Celsius (61° Fahrenheit) and humidity of 80 - 90 percent. Weekly, a mild bleach is used to fight discoloring fungus and mold on Lenin’s skin, and every eighteen months the corpse undergoes a chemical bath of glycerol and potassium for thirty days while the mausoleum is closed. During this time, Lenin’s clothes are washed and carefully ironed. And every three years, Lenin receives a new suit. Sadly, due to the recent economic crisis, the charity that funds Lenin’s upkeep has fallen on hard times and can’t afford to buy Lenin a new silk suit. But then, Lenin would probably cherish the knowledge of capitalism’s global meltdown more than a new suit, anyway. Lenin can be viewed for five minutes at a time in small groups under the watchful eye of guards in every corner of the room. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about Communist Mummies.  Lenin's Mausoleum is situated on the Red Square, next to the walls of Kremlin. Museum rules state no talking, smoking, or taking photos inside."
118,Moscow Metro Stations,"Moscow, Russia",The gorgeous entrances into the city's underbelly look more like grand halls than subway stops.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moscow-metro-stations,"Subway stations are often sordid spots, the dark, dank portals into a city’s underbelly. If you are in Moscow, however, that couldn’t be further from the case. The Russian city’s metro stations are architectural stunners, perhaps even the most beautiful in the world. The stations are so exquisite, they look like luxurious great halls rather than entrances into an underground transportation network. Every single station is different. Colorful mosaics and stained-glass windows adorn the walls of some, while glowing chandeliers dangle from the ceilings of others. Each one is like its own mini gallery, waiting to entice the more than 2.4 billion passengers who use the subway system each year. The stations’ glamorous architecture has a deeper purpose than just aesthetic pleasure. It serves as a sort of propaganda for the socialist system. Socialist symbols like the sickle and hammer pepper the designs within some of the stations. Statues and images of socialist figures abound. Originally, the metro stations also served as showcases of socialist realist art. The above address and coordinates are for the Komsomolskaya station, but the beautiful metro stations are found all over Moscow. Some of the other most impressive are Kiyevskaya, Novoslobodskaya and Taganskaya stations. A metro ticket costs just $1 for a trip of any length. So if you don't leave the stations you can spend a whole day train hopping and being wowed by the amazing stations. Trains go every two to three minutes. It can be busy during weekends and peak travel times."
119,Children are the Victims of Adult Vices,"Moscow, Russia",Thirteen sculptures in central Moscow graphically depicting vices of the modern world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/children-are-the-victims-of-adult-vices,"In 2001, Russian artist Mihail Chemiakin constructed an unusual sculpture, “Children are the Victims of Adult Vices,” depicting two unaware children playing as 13 evil statues surround them. The 13 “evil” sculptures depict alcoholism, exploitation of child labor, indifference, drug addiction, prostitution, sadism, ignorance, pseudoscience, war, poverty, theft, capitol punishment, and advocating violence. Each work is incredibly detailed, showing figures closing in on the little golden boy and girl. Besides the children, the centerpiece of the work is the statue depicting indifference to these vices, and showing a man with closed eyes, plugged ears and folded arms. When the work was first constructed, there was some concern that the outstretched hands of the grotesque evils would frighten children. Nonetheless Chemiakin’s work survived and can still be seen just south of the Kremlin on the banks of the Moscow River."
120,Museum of Soviet Arcade Games,"Moscow, Russia",Immortal combat in a Moscow museum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/soviet-arcade-game-museum,"A lot of arcades have their own special tokens for their games. But few have Soviet-era kopek coins complete with a hammer and sickle. Preserved by a few Russian students in the basement of a technical school, the Museum of Soviet Arcade Games features about 60 machines from the Soviet era including video games, pinball machines, and collaborative hockey foosball. Although only 50 to 55 of the games are playable, each of the machines paints a picture of life and entertainment behind the Iron Curtain. The museum has plans to expand as more machines are discovered and restored in the basement. Many of the machines have been sitting idle since the 1980s, when they were built in secret. Even though all of the machines are in Russian, the gist of the games is pretty apparent; in Tankodrome, for example, players shoot enemies with a tank. For an entry fee of about $8 US, visitors can walk through the museum and get a few 15-kopek coins to test out the machines."
121,Laika Monument,"Moscow, Russia",It took over half a century but a Russian monument to a famous and tragic space pup finally stands in Moscow.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laika-monument,"The Russian mutt known as Laika is the first animal to completely orbit the Earth from space (although to be fair she was dead for the vast majority of the journey), and after more than 50 years, a monument to the brave dog was finally installed near a Moscow military facility in 2008. Laika lived a bit of a rags to riches story as she began life as a homeless mongrel wandering the streets of Moscow before she was selected by the Russian space program to become the first animal to orbit the planet. Laika was chosen less for her intelligence than for her literal puppy dog eyes that the rocket scientists in Russia knew people the world over could identify with. They were not wrong, and Laika quickly gained international attention. Unfortunately this meteoric rise (pun intended) was only headed towards tragedy. The adorable little dog was trained up and fitted with a space suit before being launched into space on November 3, 1957. The craft carrying Laika, Sputnik 2, made over 2,000 revolutions of the Earth before disintegrating on reentry. According to the Russian government, Laika had perished in space either due to oxygen deprivation or a planned  euthanization. It was not until 2002 that they revealed Laika had in actuality died within hours of launch from overheating. Nonetheless, she had become a hero. Strangely, the famous mongrel did not receive her own monument in the Russian capital until 2008. The (surprisingly small) monument that now stands near a military research station is shaped like an abstract rocket that morphs into a hand, cradling Laika towards the stars. If only her actual fate had been so peaceful."

There are also taxidermy space dogs, including Belka and Strelka. The museum is contained in the base of the Monument to the Conquerors of Space."
123,Temple of All Religions,"Kazan, Russia",This Russian religious complex is a Frankenstein's chapel that includes influence from almost all the major faiths.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/temple-of-all-religions,"Located in the Russian city of Kazan, the colorful Temple of All Religions, or Universal Temple is a mish-mash of architectural flourishes culled from most of the major world religions to create an uber-complex where all religions can come together in harmony. Established by philanthropist Ildar Khanov in 1992, the site is not actually a chapel in the traditional sense but is instead a center meant to stand as a symbol of religious unity. Khanov was an active proponent of rehabilitation services and, having overseen a few in his lifetime, built the center with the help of patients he met through his work. The exterior of the Temple looks almost like something out of a Disneyland Small World display, with a Greek Orthodox dome here and a Russian minaret there. There are influences culled from Jewish synagogues and Islamic mosques, and a number of spires and bells. All said the Temple incorporates architectural influences from 16 separate religions in a bright cacophony of devotion. Khanov and his assistants lived at the site, working continually on the construction until Khanov’s death in 2013. Today the Temple is still not freely open to the public but Khanov’s associates still live on site and continue his work on the center.  You can reach the temple from Kazan by bus number 2 (leaves from railway station). Part of the building has been recently damaged by fire, but some rooms of the complex are open to visit. In June 2018, the temple was actually open and a ticket cost about 50 roebel."
124,Rasputin Museum at Yusupov Palace,"Saint Petersburg, Russia",Palace where the nearly un-killable Rasputin was murdered.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rasputin-museum-at-yusupov-palace,"“I stood watching him drink, expecting any moment to see him collapse. But he continued slowly to sip his wine like a connoisseur. His face did not change, only from time to time he put his hand to his throat as though he had some difficulty in swallowing. He rose and took a few steps. When I asked him what was the matter, he answered: ‘Why, nothing, just a tickling in my throat. The Madeira’s good,’ he remarked; ‘give me some more.’” - Prince Felix Yusupov, recalling the night he murdered Rasputin. In December 1916 at this palatial home in St. Petersburg, the young Prince Yusupov, heir to the greatest fortune in Russia and married to a cousin of the Romanov imperial family, spent a frustrating and probably terrifying night trying desperately to kill the nearly un-killable Grigory Rasputin. Rasputin was a Siberian religious mystic who had become attached to the family of Tsar Nicholas II as a healer to the tsar’s hemophiliac young son and heir, Alexei. Rasputin’s particularly close relationship with the Tsarina Alexandra, coupled with his eccentric appearance and reputation for lewd and lascivious behavior in public, fueled scandalous rumors. As World War I dragged on, the country and government teetered on the brink of collapse. To make matters worse, it appeared that the tsar – already in trouble for botched and brutal responses to internal turmoil, and general incompetency on the battlefield – was taking advice from Rasputin. By the end of 1916 a group of nobles led by Prince Yusupov decided to take matters into their own hands. Yusupov, along with conspirators Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and politician Vladimir Purishkevich, invited Rasputin to Moika Palace on the pretense of meeting his lovely young wife Irena, who was conveniently out of town. Once at the palace, Rasputin was left in a room laid out with a spread of cyanide-laced baked treats, tea, and wine. The conspirators were relieved to see Rasputin down several glasses of the poisoned wine. They became increasingly concerned, however, when the poison seemed to have no effect on the man. Legend has it that, in the end, it took poison, three bullets, a stabbing, a terrible beating, and a final drop into the icy Malaya Nevka River to kill Rasputin. However, his autopsy showed that his death was ultimately caused from the shootings. Yusupov and his conspirators never faced charges for the murder that so many knew they had committed, but just three months later the February Revolution forced the abdication of Nicholas II, and Yusupov fled the country. He later published several (sometimes conflicting) memoirs detailing the attempted murder and death of Rasputin, including a book titled “Lost Splendor.” Rasputin’s surviving daughter Maria unsuccessfully attempted to sue Yusupov and Pavlovich for damages related to the murder, but her claim, filed in Paris, was dismissed. Over the years the Moika Palace has served as an educational center, and is now a cultural museum; it is notable for having survived the Revolution and Soviet years relatively intact. In the basement room where the Mad Monk was murdered, wax figures recreate his final moments. A visit to the room is included in the afternoon tours. The rest of the building is a showpiece in itself, including a rococo theater and many elegantly appointed rooms. Rasputin’s body, fetched from the river, was originally buried on the ground of Alexander Palace, but was removed and cremated in the February 1917 uprising. Legend holds that when the flames touched his corpse, Rasputin sat upright on the pyre.  NOTE: If you show up at the palace and just buy a ticket, you will NOT get a ticket to the Rasputin exhibit. You will get a ticket to the palace interiors, which are lovely, and totally worth visiting. But if it's Rasputin you're after, and you don't speak Russian: go INSIDE (not the ticket booth outside) and just keep repeating 'Rasputin' like a simpleton until someone takes you money, hands you a ticket, and points you down the right hallway. There is a guided tour to the ""Rasputin rooms"" available on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday at 5pm from the lady who distributes audio guides inside the museum. It is 350 rubles as of Sept 2017. Metro: Sennaya Ploshchad."
125,Kizhi Island,"Medvezhyegorsky District, Russia",Stunning examples of Russia's 18th-century wooden architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kizhi-island,"Sequestered on Kizhi Island in the Republic of Karelia’s Lake Onega is a cordoned-off area, or “pogost,” containing one of the most jaw-dropping clusters of 18th century Russian architecture still in existence. Contained therein are two large churches—the 22-dome Church of the Transfiguration and the nine-dome Church of the Intercession—and an octagonal bell-tower built exclusively from wood in an architectural style once common throughout northern Russia and parts of Scandinavia. At over 120 feet tall, the Church of the Transfiguration stands out most impressively, and boasts a nave filled with iconography of saints from the orthodox faith. Used in exclusively in the summer when far-flung groups of the devout would gather at Kizhi’s pogost, the relatively simpler Church of the Intercession accommodated the smaller group of disciples whose numbers would dwindle in wintertime. Experts have dated the construction of the buildings themselves to 1713-1714, though the names of the workers remain unknown. A local legend tells of Kizhi’s main builder having used a single axe for the duration, only to cast it into Onega’s waters upon finishing and proclaim, “There was not and will be not another one to match it.” While typical of medieval and post-medieval orthodox settlements of the period, coming across such buildings today is anything but. Set against a landscape of big skies reflected in tranquil lake waters, or winters whose snows leave the belled domes as the lone sign of life for miles, Kizhi comes across as otherworldly. In 1990, the Kizhi pogost was included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites and in 1993 listed as a Russian Cultural Heritage site, where visitors are permitted to explore the structures in an open-air museum dedicated to the unique history, architecture, and ethnography of the region."

The island is so small that it is almost entirely taken up by a miniature wooden church perched charmingly atop it. While that church might seem like the stuff of Baba Yaga and Father Frost, it is actually a modern bit of whimsy built in 2000. The Church of Andrew the Apostle is a Russian Orthodox Church designed by Russian architect Andrei Rotinov, and was modeled on the famous Church of the Ascension at Kolomenskoye, a former royal estate in Moscow. Although there are no regularly scheduled ceremonies or masses at the beautiful, idyllic little chapel, it is available by appointment for baptisms and weddings. The island is currently reachable by a bridge. There are numerous references to the church being in the Guinness Book of World Records for being “the world’s only church built on a tiny island,” but these claims have proven difficult to confirm. Andrew the Apostle is the patron saint of fishermen.  From Peter need to move on Priozersk highway, Sapernom turn off the road to the left. We pass the village Vasilyev and immediately behind it will be a pointer to the right. We turn off and rests in the parking lot. Further, about two hundred meters on the trodden road straight to the beach. The road takes about 2 hours"
127,Golosov Ravine,"Moscow, Russia",Legends of time travel and magical woodland creatures bolster the natural charm of this verdant sanctuary in the midst of Moscow.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golosov-ravine,"Feeding into the Moscow River, Golosov Ravine cleaves Kolomenskoye Park in two. Once a royal estate and now a public wilderness covering an area 15% larger than Central Park, Kolomenskoye Park is an inviting place for a stroll. The ravine at its heart, however — and the tales surrounding it — add an air of mystical intrigue to an otherwise pedestrian excursion. The earliest tale of mystery regarding Golosov Ravine dates back to 1621, when a Tatar cavalry detachment turned up at the walls of the Tsar’s palace. They were lost and disoriented, claiming to be part of the army of a Crimean khan that had attacked Moscow in 1571. Sensing defeat and wanting to avoid capture, they retreated into Golosov Ravine where they were quickly enveloped in a thick green mist. Spending what seemed like only a few minutes finding their way through the fog, they emerged to find that 50 years had passed. They reportedly carried outdated equipment, and an inquiry formed by the Tsar found that the men “probably told the truth.” Time travel: confirmed. This wasn’t the only reported incident of time-warping mist descending on Golosov Ravine. In the 19th century, two local fellows had a big night out at a neighboring village and decided to take a shortcut through the ravine on their way home. They finally turned up again 20 years later, telling a tale of finding themselves trapped in a dense fog at the bottom of a ravine, where they met large, hairy, manlike creatures who managed to put them back on the right path via hand signals. However, they were shocked to find that two decades had passed, and that their wives and children did not recognize them. The incident was reported to the police who conducted an investigation, during which one of the men dissolved into the fog and never returned — or rather hasn’t…yet. Time travel: double confirmed. Large hairy man-creatures figure prominently into the legends of Golosov Ravine and most likely represent the leshy, a sort of bigfoot from Slavic mythology who is more man than ape and more woodland spirit than mortal creature. In 1926, a policeman reported seeing a “hairy wild man” over two meters tall in Golosov Ravine. The resulting investigation into the cop’s claims led to the remarkable claim in an official Moscow newspaper that a band of Young Pioneers (think Soviet Boy Scouts) had captured a leshy. An etymological case has been made that Golosov Ravine was once the site of a shrine to Veles, the Slavic trickster god of earth, waters, woods, magic, and the underworld. While this theory has not been confirmed, it suggests some context for the trickery-laden sylvan legends associated with the place. Golosov Ravine is the site of several springs considered sacred in Russian Orthodox, neopagan, and new age traditions, and contains a neopagan sacred stone shrine consisting of two five-ton rocks called Diviy (radiating “female energy”) and Gus (radiating “male energy”). Today, visitors to Golosov Ravine can not only go for a wander but also venerate these rocks, meditate and anoint themselves in spring water — comfortable in the knowledge that there have been no recent reports of mist-induced time travel or giant hairy man-creatures."
128,The Amber Room,"Pushkin, Russia","An 18th century wonder of the world, lost in WWII, re-created at the Catherine Palace.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amber-room-catherine-palace,"One of history’s great lost treasures, the spectacular Baroque Amber Room once dazzled visitors to the czar’s Winter House in St. Petersburg, where more than six tons of amber were arranged against mirrors and gold leaf into an enormous, golden gallery. For most of history, the area formerly known as Prussia was the world’s most significant producer of amber, and it is still associated with the area today. The golden-colored fossilized tree sap can actually be found in locations all around the world, but has been famed and traded in Eastern Europe since at least Roman times. Designed between 1701-1711, the original Amber Room was first installed in Berlin, then given as a gift to Peter the Great, moved to Russia and expanded until it covered an estimated 180 square feet. In 1755 it was again moved, this time to the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo, near St. Petersburg. During WWII, desperate officials at the Catherine Palace hid the national treasure behind wallpaper, in an attempt to stave off the art-crazed looters of the incoming Nazi army. It was, however, all for naught and the Nazis promptly made off with crates full of amber, and brought it back to Germany where it was triumphantly exhibited at Königsberg Castle. That is, it was triumphantly exhibited until they too felt the other shoe drop, and this time officials ripped out the magnificent panels and hid them away…somewhere. Since the end of WWII, historians, art lovers, and treasure hunters alike have sought the lost Amber Room, looking in silver mines and shallow waters, investigating stories of shipwrecks in the Baltic Sea and secret caves in the German countryside. It has never been found. Most experts today agree that the room is most likely gone forever, lost in the fires that consumed Königsberg Castle after the fall of Nazi Germany. The site where the Königsberg Castle once stood is now covered by a massive and strange building known as the “House of Soviets”, built in 1960, but incomplete and empty to this day. The space under the property has never been thoroughly investigated, so some mystery remains. In the meantime, reconstruction efforts began in 1979 at the Catherine Palace, but it was not until 2003 that the new version was revealed. Based on old depictions and photographs, the new Amber Room is believed to hone more closely to the original installation as it would have been seen in Berlin."
129,Prisoner Art of Guaita Tower,"Città di San Marino, San Marino",High in the clouds of San Marino sits an ancient tower with some curious prisoner graffiti.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prisoner-art-of-la-rocca-tower,"Rocca Guaita is one of three castle peaks in the city of San Marino, capital of the tiny republic of the same name. Entirely encircled by Italy, this little country historically protected itself from invasion, siege and attack by retreating inside these walls, which include an old prison with some 19th century “outsider art.” Some of the castle structures at Guaita date as far back as the 10th and 11th centuries, but the prison isn’t quite that old. The tower is open to visitors, and here you can see recently discovered prisoner graffiti that had been hidden under layers and layers of whitewash for the past 200 or more years. The work ranges from scribbles to soldiers, with some geometric patterns and fair maidens popping up too. And there are some far more expressive – and sometimes bizarre – figures that may have been inspired by the less-than-homey conditions. Of all the images, one man in particular gets a good deal of wall space, but it’s a mystery who the man is. He’s bearded with curly hair and small mustache, always in profile, and looks alternately like Abe Lincoln or Bradley Cooper in American Hustle. Whether he was a prisoner or a guard, or just someone famous in the day, that one face got a lot of attention. The prison was closed in 1970, and it has a long and dark history going back to the late middle ages. The graffiti, on the other hand, looks positively modern when compared to those old medieval walls. San Marino is what they call a ""microstate"", a small republic surrounded by Italy. It's about 15 miles in from the coast of the Adriatic Sea, and has some very steep hills and mountains. Rocca Guaita is one of the three peaks of Mount Titano in the capital city, also called San Marino. Admission is €3 for just Rocca Guaita (the First Tower), or €4,50 for both Rocca Guaita and Cesta Castle (the Second Tower). Hours are 9am to 5pm (closed certain holidays), and during the summer season (June 7 through Sept. 14) from 8am to 8pm. Best always to call ahead – there is always the possibility that hours and prices may change."
130,San Marino Jinja,"Serravalle, San Marino",The only Shinto shrine in Europe that has been officially sanctioned by Japan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/san-marino-jinja,"Shinto, or Shintoism, is a pantheistic and animistic religion that originated in Japan. Lacking a doctrine, it’s more a traditional culture rather than a strict religion for most Japanese people. Reportedly there are over 88,000 Shinto shrines in Japan, so spotting one in the country is rather easy, as most neighborhoods have a jinja (“shrine”) of their own. There are also several Shinto shrines across the globe, particularly in former Japanese colonies such as Taiwan, Palau, and Saipan, as well as in Brazil and Hawaii, where many Japanese people migrated to during the early 20th- century. Europe has a few shrines, although only one of them has been officially sanctioned by Japan’s Association of Shrines. In the heart of San Marino, a tiny republic enclosed by Italy, a Shinto shrine was established in 2014 to commemorate the 20,000 lives lost in the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Funded by the San Marino-Japan Friendship Society, it was constructed in the Shinmei-zukuri style partially using the wood of the Ise Grand Shrine. Its main subject of worship is Amaterasu, the sun goddess and a major deity in the Shinto pantheon. The shrine’s inauguration was attended by 150 people, including several Japanese officials such as the president of the Association of Shrines, the chief priest of Iwashimizu Hachimangū Shrine, and the mother of the prime minister. San Marino Jinja’s chief priest, Francesco Brigante, is a local Sammarinese hotel owner who was officially appointed to the position by the Association of Shrines in 2013."
131,Montale,"Città di San Marino, San Marino",The smaller of the three towers of San Marino is a former prison inaccessible from the ground level.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/montale,"The towers perched on the top of the three peaks of Monte Titano are the symbol of the small country of San Marino, but while the first and second are famous tourist attractions, the third is hardly visited. The third tower, known as Montale, is the smallest and most recent of the three fortifications. It was constructed during the 14th-century after some earlier structures were renovated. In 1320, it was connected to the other two towers by a wall. The fort was initially used as a watchtower during the wars against the Malatesta family that ruled the surrounding area. A bell inside the tower was used to indicate to the population that a threat was imminent. The tower was also used as a prison with the only entrance being a few feet from the ground, making it impossible to access this area of the interior from ground level. After the destruction of the Malatestian fort of Fiorentino in 1479, the Montale was abandoned. It was subsequently restored in 1743, 1817, and 1935. Currently, the interior of the tower cannot be accessed by the public, but the view that can be enjoyed from the peak is worth the trek to the base of the tower."
