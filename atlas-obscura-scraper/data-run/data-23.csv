0,Salto de Monday,"Presidente Franco, Paraguay","An underexplored, 130-foot tropical waterfall that you will have all to yourself.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/salto-de-monday,"If Saltos del Monday (Monday Falls) was located just about anywhere else on Earth, it would be crowded by marveling visitors. But it just so happens that this magnificent Paraguayan waterfall is located just a few miles from the thundering Iguazu Falls, one of the most famous falls in South America. And so, this breathtaking cascade in Paraguay is mostly ignored by tourists who race to more famous waterfall parks in nearby Brazil and Argentina. While the waterfall is not quite as powerful and impressive as its neighbors, this watery wonder is a quiet, relaxed affair, free from the chaos of crowds. Saltos del Monday may be little-known globally, but for the pre-Hispanic Guarani natives, the local waterfall held mythological significance and served as an important meeting place. (More recently, the site was the setting of a B-list Paraguayan horror film well known among young locals.) At the small, wooded Saltos del Monday park, visitors can take short hikes through rare Atlantic Forest, picnic under towering trees, or descend steel steps to watch the chocolate-colored Monday River roar down vegetation-covered cliffs. Watch for unique birds called Great Dusky Swifts, as they swoop in and out of the waterfall—they make their nests behind the falling water to defend their young from jungle predators.  Admission to the park is 35,000 GS (about $6 USD) for foreigners. The park is open daily from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m."
1,Jesuit Mission of Jesús de Tavarangüe,"Jesús de Tavarangue, Paraguay",These spectacular ruins were built by Spanish padres in the 17th century.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jesuit-mission-of-jesus-de-tavarangue,"Deep in the heart of Itapua, Paraguay, are the Jesuit missions (also known as “reductions”) of La Santisima Trinidad and Jesús de Tavarangüe. Accessible from the southern city of Encarnacion, the ruins lie about 45 minutes outside of the city by bus. The Reducción de Jesús was established in 1685, in a different location near the Monday river. It was relocated several times, and moved to this location in what is now Itapua in 1760. The Jesuits planned to build replica of the Church of Saint Ignatius of Loyola in Italy at the site, which would have been one of the largest churches in the area at that time. But when the Jesuit order was expelled from Paraguay in 1767, the construction of the mission had not yet been completed, and so the semi-complete church fell into ruin. In 1993, the ruins of Jesús de Tavarangüe, together with la Santisima Trinidad, became a UNESCO World Heritage site and have become a popular tourist attraction for the country of Paraguay."
2,Castillo Carlota Palmerola,"Areguá, Paraguay",An unlikely neo-Gothic castle in the Paraguayan countryside.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castillo-carlota-palmerola,"Located in the village of Areguá in the lowlands of western Paraguay, Castillo Carlota Palmerola was the brainchild of the unconventional Palmerola Ayala family. Built in 1897, the mansion incorporated an odd mix of medieval styles and looks dramatically out of place in its tropical surroundings. This eccentricity was intentional. After building their unusual estate, the Palmerola Ayala family quickly opened the castle for public balls and parties, which helped cement their social status and reputation. In 1956, the family donated the estate to the Catholic Church and the complex was transformed into a convent. Nuns replaced well-dressed revellers and a chapel was added to the gardens. Today, visitors can roam the well-manicured grounds and wander rooms filled with early 19th-century furniture, art, and oddities, including a grotesque display of taxidermized pets.  The Castillo Carlota Palmerola is only open to the public on Sundays and the hours vary seasonally. Check the official website for opening hours."
3,Casa de la Independencia,"Asunción, Paraguay",The fighters and conspirators that won independence for Paraguay held secret meetings at this historic house.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casa-de-la-independencia,"The humble design and construction of the Casa de la Independencia do not do justice to the historical significance this house commands in Paraguay. Antonio Martínez Sáenz purchased the home in 1772, and used bamboo and palm wood to fortify the mud walls and thatched roof, a common building technique that’s still used in many rural parts of the region. At the time, the house had no other purpose than to provide a place for Sáenz and his wife, Petrona Caballero de Bazán, to bring up their children. It was their children, Pedro Pablo and Sebastián Antonio, that placed this house at the center of a political process that would revolutionize the history of Paraguay. Having inherited the house, the two brothers began hosting secret meetings with various figures that contributed to the political upheaval in the country. Many notable fighters and conspirators participated in the clandestine meetings at the Casa de la Independencia, including Captain Pedro Juan Caballero, Captain Juan Bautista Rivarola, Lieutenant Mariano Recalte, and Fulgencio Yegros, all renowned Paraguayan patriots. Their efforts would lead to the proclamation of the Paraguayan Republic in 1813 and the declaration of independence in 1842. Nowadays, the building houses the Casa de la Independencia Museum. The furniture, artwork, weapons, and everyday tools on display are from the 1800s. Original documents related to the revolution and signed by patriots are kept in the office, one of the rooms in the museum. The building itself is one of the few remaining examples of colonial architecture in the city of Asunción.  The Casa de la Independencia is located at the intersection between streets 14 de Mayo and Presidente Franco. The museum is open Monday to Friday, and Saturday morning."
4,La Santísima Trinidad de Paraná,"Trinidad, Paraguay","Of the many Jesuit missions in South America, this complex is one of the best preserved.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-santisima-trinidad-de-parana,"During the 17th and 18th century, Jesuit missionaries founded dozens of settlements in South America, especially in Paraguay, northern Argentina, and southern Brazil, in an effort to colonize the area and evangelize the locals. The expansion of European empires heightened interest in mission societies, who saw opportunity in newly colonized territories and their native peoples. Each of these missions would effectively function as a “state within a state,” remaining autonomous and isolated from Spanish and Portuguese rule. The result was self-contained societies in which Indigenous people and the European settlers lived together. Though the locals were not forced into living in the missions, they were expected to convert to Christianity. Paraguay contains some of the best-preserved and easily accessible examples of Jesuit missions, like La Santísima Trinidad de Paraná and the nearby Jesús de Tavarangüe, a reduction located in the south of the country, in the small town of Trinidad. This mission was one of the latest ones, being founded in 1706. It featured a large central plaza, a church, a school, a museum, several workshops, and houses. The Jesuits were expelled from Spanish colonies in 1768, and all the missions were abandoned. Many were looted by people searching for gold or other goods left behind by the missionaries. But la Santísima Trinidad de Paraná was mostly spared from destruction, along with the nearby mission of Jesús de Tavarangue."
5,Machu Picchu: The Lost City of The Inca,"Aguas Calientes, Peru",The intricate stonework of Machu Picchu serves as a testament to Incan engineers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stonework-machu-picchu,"In Cusco, at 11,000 feet the mountain weather is kaleidoscopic, and the Inca tradition is palpably present. Cusco is every single thing that Santa Fe, New Mexico would like to be - magnificently Spanish colonial, profoundly Indian, filled with often brilliant crafts, and made entirely of real adobe. Just up the hill is the famed Sacsayhuaman complex of behemoth stones perfectly fitted together by Incan engineers. (A nice place to stay in Cusco is the Hotel Monasterio - a restored monastery now run by the Orient Express.) The train ride to Aguas Caliente is worth the trip all by itself. Surprisingly, Machu Picchu (at nearly 8,000 feet) itself is in fact lower than Cusco, and it’s northwestward, down into the Amazon jungle. As one travels along one sees the biomes change before their eyes. Along the whole way are spectacular rivers, especially the Urubamba, plunging white water without end for miles - it is so relentless and violent, that to this day it has never been kayaked. (When the train stops jump out for some hot corn on the cob offered by locals, with kernels seemingly as big as Inca stonework and purely delicious.) One is also reminded they are in the Andes. They dwarf all other mountain ranges. So godallmighty huge and steep and inviting and menacing and one marvel at the skill of the Inca and their predecessors, to imagine their mastering these mountains as they did. If we judge the Greeks and Romans highly because of the excellence of their architecture, what do we make of the Inca, who could be said to surpass them architecturally? In fact, the Inca surpasses everybody in their reverence for stone and water. At Machu Picchu sixteen stone waterfalls sequence down one side of the site. All over Machu Picchu massive crafted stones are fit together in near-perfect harmony and celebrate the sun, the year cycle, the surrounding mountain shapes, and the way humans take a step. Machu Picchu is among the greatest architectural achievements and cultural centers of the Incas and the Old World. It is so perfectly built that the structures are able to survive earthquakes, pretty common in Peru and specifically in Machu Picchu, as it was built on top of two fault lines. Since its discovery, the citadel has attracted millions of tourists, becoming the most visited attraction in Peru. Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.   As of 2017, stricter rules have been placed on visiting Machu Picchu in attempt to deal with the masses that visit every day. Visitors will not be allowed to enter without an authorized guide. Machu Picchu is limited to 2,500 tourists per day. There are already arrows to help control the flow of visitors but these will be more prominent. There are also changes to opening times for Machu Picchu, Huayna Picchu/Wayna Picchu, and Cerro Machu Picchu. Entrance to Machu Picchu is split between a 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM entrance. Buses leave frequently from the small town of Aguas Callientes -- which in itself is a charming mountain community & very tourist trappy! The trip to the site is about 30 minutes on a road with 14 turns! You can also reach Machu Picchu by trekking the Inca trails, there are few options like the classic trail, one-day trail, and the Mollepata trail all of them reach to the Machu Picchu and take four, one and five days respectively. All of them provide an amazing and rewarding trekking experience. Alternatively, you can hike solo to Machu Picchu via Hidroelektrika. It takes 2.5 hours, one way, to reach Aguas Calientes from Hidroelektrika. Trail is straightforward; you just follow the train tracks. Make sure to get the 7am van from Cusco to Hidroelektrika so you'll be at Aguas Calientes by 5pm. When going back to Hidroelektrika, leave by 11am so you'll catch the vans going back to Cusco at 2pm.Be sure to wear comfortable shoes or boots fit for hiking! Many of the steps in the site are stone & often uneven -- they can be hard on your feet & legs. If you do choose to trek the Inca Trail, make sure you bring a very warm sleeping bag as it can get incredibly cold at night."
6,Q'eswachaka Rope Bridge,Peru,"Keshwa chaca, among the last handwoven Incan bridges, crosses Apurimac Canyon in Peru.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/last-handwoven-bridge,"Known as Q’eswachaka (the first syllable is a lateral “click”), Queshuachaca or Keshwa Chaca, this is one of the only remaining examples of the Incan handwoven bridges once common in the Incan road system. Made of woven straw, the bridge spans 118 feet and hangs 60 feet above the canyon’s rushing river. The Incan women braided small, thin ropes, which were then braided again by the men into large support cables, much like a modern steel suspension bridge. Handwoven bridges have been part of the trail and roadway system for over 500 years, and were held in very high regard by the Inca. The punishment for tampering with such a bridge was death. Over time, however, the bridges decayed, or were removed, leaving this last testament to Incan engineering. The bridges’ sagging was addressed by destroying and rebuilding it in an annual ceremony—originally considered a social obligation under Inca rule, and now preserved as a way of honoring their history by the nearby community of Quehue, Peru. This bridge has been christened with a traditional Incan ceremonial bridge blessing and is in extremely good condition. Every June, Quechua communities gather on the banks of the Apurimac River to renovate the bridge. On this day, they manifest their honour to Pachamama, the Earth Mother, and behold archaic traditions. When the work is over, people express gratitude to Apus (mountain spirits) and afterward celebrate with music, traditional food and drinks  From Sicuani, follow signs to Arequipa (a left turn if you are on the main highway facing toward Cuzco). Continue on that road until you begin seeing signs for Quehue. From Quehue, continue through town to the west (probably best to ask directions from a local at this point). When you cross the Apurímac River on the steel roadway bridge, Q'eswachaka is on your right. There is one walkway down to it on either side of the roadway bridge (about 100 m away from the bridge in both cases). The geocoordinates are -14.3811214,-71.484012."
7,Rainbow Mountain,"Pitumarca, Peru",A remote candy-striped mountain in the Peruvian Andes straight out of the pages of Dr. Seuss.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vinicunca-rainbow-mountain,"The peaks in the Ausangate mountain region of the Peruvian Andes are all uncommonly colored: Some are terra cotta, some lavender, others are a vibrant turquoise. They’re colored by the sediment and atmosphere of the area, unique because of its altitude and isolation close to the ocean. But none are quite so marvelous as Vinicunca, also known as Rainbow Mountain, Winikunka, Montaña de Colores, and Montaña de Siete Colores. For all its striking colors, Rainbow Mountain was notoriously hard to find. It’s located deep in the mountain range, and even the most adept travelers with highly experienced guides have reported difficulty locating it. In the past, it took about six days of hiking to reach its peak. Nowadays, there are plenty of bus tours departing from Cusco to the mountain. Due to the increase in popularity of the mountain, it has very quickly become Peru’s second most visited tourist site. During the peak season, it can see up to 4000 people per day. To be sure, those who love hiking will enjoy the journey; the Ausangate trek is one of the most popular among visitors to Peru. There are hot springs, local villages and vendors, stunning views of the Ausangate Glacier, and llamas and alpacas along the way. And nothing caps off almost a week of trekking like a visit to this breathtaking painted mountain.  There is now a road leading to the mountain. The trek to the summit can now be done in a couple of hours. While the hike is not long, the altitude can cause problems for those not used to it. A horse and guide can be rented for around 50 to 100 soles."
8,Convento de San Francisco Ossuary,"Lima, Peru","The mortal remains of an estimated 70,000 people lie in the basement of a monastery in Lima, Peru.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/convento-de-san-francisco-ossuary,"Beneath the church at the Franciscan Monastery in Lima, Peru, there is an ossuary where the skulls and bones of an estimated 70,000 people are decoratively arranged. Long forgotten, the catacombs were rediscovered in 1943 and are believed to be connected via subterranean passageways to the cathedral and other local churches. Both creepy and beautiful, they feature small grates scattered along the upper floor of the cathedral through which, while you are touring, you may look down at any given moment to see the artistically arranged dead illuminated. It's one block northeast from the Plaza Mayor. There is no photography allowed inside the ossuary. There is an entrance fee."
9,The Boiling River of the Amazon,"Puerto Inca, Peru",This scalding hot river was thought to be a myth until one geoscientist made it his quest to study the mystical waters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-boiling-river-of-the-amazon-puerto-inca-peru,"Hidden in the dense jungle of the Peruvian Amazon is a percolating, roiling river. The steaming turquoise waters that can reach up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit are guided by ivory-colored stones and guarded by 60-foot walls of lush forest and vegetation. Locals believed the river was sacred and that the hot waters held healing powers, and shamans incorporated it into medicines. As a child, Andrés Ruzo listened to his Peruvian grandfather tell the story of the Boiling River, or Shanay-timpishka, an ancient name loosely translating to “boiling with the heat of the sun.” The headwaters are marked with a boulder in the shape of a snake’s head. According to legend, a giant serpent spirit named Yacumama or “Mother of the Waters” who gives birth to hot and cold waters heats the river. For 12 years, Ruzo was skeptical that the river truly existed. Then, as he was creating a thermal map of Peru during his graduate studies at Southern Methodist University in Texas, he discovered an unusually large hot spot—one of the largest geothermal features found on any continent. In November 2011, he went on an expedition to central Peru with his aunt to see the Boiling River for himself. From the nearest city Pucallpa, the entire journey took about four hours, including a two-hour drive, 45-minute motorized canoe ride, and an hour hike along muddy jungle paths. The river is protected by the shaman of the small town Mayantuyacu, a secluded healing center. After getting special permission from the shaman to study the water, Ruzo was led by the shaman’s apprentice to the almost four-mile stretch of flowing, scalding water. The water temperature ranges from 120 degrees up to almost 200 degrees Fahrenheit, and reaches 16 feet deep in some places. The mud of the riverbank was too hot to walk on, and if you fell in your skin would be covered in third-degree burns in less than a second. Small unfortunate animals, like frogs, could be found floating dead and broiled in the water, the “eyes always seem to cook first turning milky white,” Ruzo wrote in National Geographic. Ruzo, wearing only sandals, carefully hopped between the small white rocks the size of paper to take samples of different areas of the river. He found that the water averages 187 degrees Fahrenheit, which isn’t quite boiling, but is still really hot, with steam emanating off the surface. The geothermal feature struck Ruzo as odd since it isn’t located near volcanic or magmatic activity. “Boiling rivers exist,” he wrote in National Geographic, “but they’re always near volcanoes.” A body of water the size of the Boiling River requires a heat source with a lot of energy, yet the closest active volcano is more than 400 miles away and there are no known magmatic systems in the Amazon jungle. After some investigating and testing different hypotheses, Ruzo and his research colleagues believe that a fault-led hydrothermal feature was causing the river to reach such temperatures. The water seeps deep into the earth, heats up underground, and resurfaces through faults and cracks. Since his initial visit to the Boiling River, the trip from Pucallpa has been reduced to a three-hour direct drive because of the rapid deforestation and commercialization of the area. To preserve the sacred river, Ruzo started the Boiling River Project to protect and study the natural wonder in a safe manner. Ruzo details his experience with the Boiling River in his book The Boiling River: Adventure and Discovery in the Amazon. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the Boiling River."
10,Nazca Lines,"Nazca, Peru",Giant ancient line art drawn in the Peruvian desert so large that it can only be fully seen from the sky.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nazca-lines-peru,"The Nazca Lines are legendary. Stretching across nearly 200 square miles of high arid plateau, these drawings of hundreds of figures range from giant spiders to vast geometric shapes, to enormous monkeys as large as 890 feet (roughly two and a half football fields). Hummingbirds, fish, sharks or orcas, llamas, and lizards—and, according to some, astronauts, aliens, and landing zones—are all depicted in these enormous line drawings. One of the most tantalizingly mysterious archeological sites, these geoglyphs have spawned wild theories about the ancient Peruvian peoples that made them. One significant reason there is so much interest in the drawings: they can only be fully seen from a few hundred feet in the air, meaning that the people who created them never would have had a way to see them in full… unless, of course, you believe they did. Due to the mystery surrounding their exact purpose and the fact that they can only be fully seen from the sky, the lines are of particular attraction to new-agers, ancient astronaut theorists, and alien enthusiasts — much to the frustration of the anthropologists, archaeologists, and astronomers who have studied the lines and hope to provide credible answers to their purpose and creation. The glyphs were made between 200 BC and 600 AD, the time of the technologically sophisticated Nazca people, who are believed to have created the lines. They were created by scraping a 10 to 30 cm layer of iron oxide off of the dry desert floor. Due to the incredible dryness and consistent weather of the area, this was all it took to create images that have lasted for well over 1,500 years. The lines were first systematically studied by the Peruvian archaeologist Toribio Mejia Xesspe in 1926, ever since it has been a mystery. The most likely construction method involves putting stakes in the ground, tying a rope between them, and scraping the dirt off along the rope. This would explain the geometric shape of many of the lines, as well as how the Nazca would have kept the measurements for the drawings in ratio to each other, by simply multiplying the measurements of a drawing into rope lengths. Wooden stakes found in the ground at the end of some lines support this theory of creation. But the real mystery comes not in the how, but the why. The explanation most in keeping with what is known about the Nazca culture is that the lines were made to be walked upon as a sort of ceremonial procession that led to a sacred area where the Nazca prayed to various gods involving agriculture and water. The shapes, then, were never meant to be seen at all, and it was only with the advent of modern aircraft that they were. Another viable suggestion is that the figures were intended to be seen by the gods; a sort of early SETI program to announce, “We are here! You, in the sky, are you out there?” Others believe that the lines were a giant astronomical calendar pointing to the locations where celestial bodies would align themselves. However, archaeoastronomists who examined the site in 2000 dismissed this claim as insufficiently supported. The wildest and least sensible theory—though certainly one of the most seductive and popular—involves ancient aliens who communicated with the ancient Peruvians and used the lines as navigational devices or even landing fields for some type of ancient astronaut. Yet another alternative explanation is that the Nazca did indeed have a way to see the drawings from the air: hot air balloons. Recently Jim Woodmann, a proponent of the Nazca hot-air balloon theory, managed to build one using only materials and techniques that the Nazca would have had available. Hot air balloonists argue that the Nazca were a technologically advanced society and point to their having built an impressive system of underground aqueducts, known as puquios, that still function today. However, there is no evidence besides the possibility that the Nazca ever built or had hot air balloons. Despite the figures having been examined by numerous anthropologists, ethnologists, and archaeologists, not to mention new-agers, ancient astronaut theorists, and alien enthusiasts, we may never truly know what the Nazca lines were meant for, or how the Nazca people intended them to be seen. What we do know, though, is that they are incredibly fascinating. The lines have seen some intrusion and damage over the years. When the Pan-American 1S Highway was constructed through the area, it transected the lines themselves. In 2014 Greenpeace activists walked across part of the plain to lay a banner message near the Hummingbird. By not wearing the special protective shoes used by researchers, they caused permanent damage to the soil.  In early 2018, a truck driver ran over the ancient lines, leaving tracks across 104-by-328-foot area of the site and causing damage to three of the geoglyphs. Now, the best way to see the Nazca Lines is to hop on a plane in one of the nearby cities (Nazca, Pisco, or Ica). The prices are about $100 + airport tax. Take a bus from either Lima (7 hours) or Arequipa (8 hours) to Nazca. Flights can be arranged by local tour agencies, or take any collectivo or bus heading north to get to the Mirador viewing tower 20 km north of town. Best flights over the lines are those before noon–the wind starts to pick up then and your flight can be bumpy!"
11,Mercado de Brujas,"Lima, Peru",A market for witches is hidden within a train station.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mercado-de-brujas,"The Mercado de Brujas, or Witch Market, in Lima, Peru sells snake fat for arthritis, smoothies blended with herbs and spices for various ailments—including one with blended with frog, also for arthritis—and black candles for curses, among many other curious items. Even many locals have never heard of the market, which is within the Gamarra Market and just outside the Gamarra train station.  Keep an eye out for vendors selling python skins, and you have found it. The focus here is on the traditional folk medicine that is widely practiced among indigenous groups and the greater Peruvian society. You’ll find many of health supplements are for sale here. You can find collagen, spirulina, maca root, and aphrodisiacs . Also for sale are palo santo, dried llama fetus, divination cards, charms, soaps, perfumes, crystals and all sorts of things to ward off evil and to attract good fortune. Ritual items such as snake skins, sea shells, cactus leaves, and hatun hampi (a mixture of local dirt, rocks, seeds, and spices) are the main offering. And if you need guidance, witch doctors and healers are also at the market to help customers through treatments and readings. Around the corner, on the streets leading onto the Gamarra Market, there are snake oil salesmen with microphones performing for crowds. You can take the train there, get off at Gamarra, which is elevated above street level. The market is in at least three market buildings on the east side of the street beginning just north of the station. Go up strains too; there are mediums offering readings and treatments there. There are many of booths on the side walk and along the street. On the west side of the street is a live animal market. The whole area is part of an enormous market. It's packed, so leave your valuables at home. When things start to close, the line for the train gets very busy but it's easy and cheap to get a cab."
12,Ollantaytambo Ruins,"Ollantaytambo, Peru",Preserved Inca city and site of the last Inca stronghold against the Spanish conquistadors.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ollantaytambo-ruins,"Dating back to the reign of 15th-century Emperor Pachacuti who conquered the region, the town of Ollantaytambo contains some of Peru’s best-preserved Inca ruins. Strategically located in the far western reaches of the Sacred Valley, around a 1.5-hour drive from Cusco, Ollantaytambo was home to the Inca elite of the time. Massive reconstruction efforts undertaken by Emperor Pachacuti following the destruction of the original town yielded the architecture and innovations that define the site today. The town’s primary attraction is the Ollantaytambo Fortress on the outskirts of the settlement in a section known as the Temple Hill. Though originally built for purposes of worship by Emperor Pachacuti, the fortress served as the last Inca stronghold against the Spanish Conquistadors and has the distinction of being the site of one of the only battles in which the Inca successfully repelled Spanish forces. Not far from the fortress is the Wall of the Six Monoliths, a towering section of wall composed of six large segments. Construction of the wall was abandoned before its completion for reasons that remain unknown. Other nearby attractions include the Temple of the Sun and the Princess Baths, both of which feature examples of Inca carvings. The town itself should not be undersold. A walk through the settlement provides an unparalleled glimpse into the lives of the town’s former inhabitants and offers visitors an intimate look at Ollantaytambo’s distinctive layout and dwellings. Noteworthy features include quarries, terraces, ceremonial grounds, and storehouses. The full Boleto Turistico del Cusco (130 soles or about US$36.50 per person) is valid for 10 days from the first time you use it. It includes admission to some museums in Cuzco, all of the archaeological sites around Cuzco, and the major archaeological sites in the Sacred Valley, including Ollantaytambo. If you do not plan to visit the archaeological sites or museums in and around Cusco and just want to focus on the archaeological sites in the Sacred Valley, get the partial Boleto Turistico (70 soles or about US$20 per person). You can buy a Boleto Turistico in an office near the main plaza in Cuzco or at the site itself."
13,Huayllay National Sanctuary,"Casma District, Peru",A remarkable geological formation resembling a forest made of stone.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/huayllay-national-sanctuary,"It doesn’t get much more remote than the bottom of the sea. 75 million years ago, that’s where the unique geological features of the Huayllay Stone Forest got their start. Some time has passed since then, but while the location of this rocky outcrop has changed relative to the seafloor, its fascinating features have only gotten more weird as glaciers scampered over it and torrential downpours and fierce winds tore through its many ruts and crevices. Jagged rock walls, naturally sculpted stone shards that pierce the topsoil from somewhere deep below, and impassibly disjointed plateaus are just a few of the unreal formations that can be experienced here and nowhere else. From a slight distance, it’s easy to see where the stone forest gets its name – the densely packed, tapering rocks literally appear to be a standing forest turned to stone. Prospective visitors will be happy to know that in the modern epoch, the Huayllay Stone Forest is well above sea level, and although still quite remote, also quite visitable with the right amount of gumption. Now part of a nature area designated and protected by the Peruvian national government under the umbrella title of Huayllay National Sanctuary, tourism has picked up by the smallest of increments, but the remote location still makes transportation and lodging hard to come by. Put it this way: adventurers looking for something a bit more rustic than Grand Canyon-like tourist areas can expect to have the vast nature preserve entirely to themselves, or at least nearly so. Word about this remarkable location has been slow to spread, and its most frequent visitors are still the Llamas and other protected wildlife that have inhabited it for thousands of years. The desolation and unbelievable geology of the Huayllay area can make it easy to imagine that you’re actually visiting an alien world, but one look at the prehistoric cave and rock paintings found in some areas of the park are a poignant reminder that you are, in fact, still on the same planet as the rest of us – even though you might have to look back thousands of years to find some evidence of human life."
14,Chauchilla Cemetery,"Nazca, Peru","Plundered and left asunder by grave robbers, this ancient necropolis has been painstakingly pieced back together.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chauchilla-cemetery,"Since 1997, Peruvian law has protected the haunting Chauchilla Cemetery, a Nazca burial ground where mummified corpses were laid to rest until the ninth century. Prior to 1997, it was ravaged mercilessly by Peruvian grave robbers. For many of these ancient corpses, it was the second time they lost their heads. Scattered among the many full-bodied mummies at Chauchilla Cemetery are a number of mummified heads. Many of the heads have been specially prepared with holes drilled into the backs of their skulls, and in some cases, rope has been threaded through the mummified head. This is possibly so they could be worn as a necklace or as a jaunty charm hanging off of a belt. Though originally believed to be “trophy heads” taken in battles, recent evidence shows that the heads actually came from the same population as the rest of the mummies, suggesting the heads may not have been taken in battle after all. The exact nature and use of the heads remain distinctly unclear. Despite the fact that the burial grounds have not been utilized since the ninth century, the human remains are astoundingly well-preserved. The Peruvian Desert’s dry climate is, of course, a factor in the preservation, but burial practices also contributed to the condition of many of the corpses, some still hanging on to their hair and skin over 1200 years after their demise. Clothed in cotton and painted with resin, the deceased were placed in mud-bricked tombs. Wooden posts that were once assigned by archeologists to the category of religious use are now thought to be drying posts for the dead, which would explain the added step needed for such an impressive example of mummification. Discovered in the 1920s, the remains and artifacts were spread across the area, picked over by nefarious pilferers. The burial ground has been restored to as close to its original state as possible, with the bones, bodies, heads, and artifacts either returned to tombs or showcased in displays.  Awnings have been added to cover the tombs and prevent more sun damage.  Chauchilla Cemetery is located 28.5 km (17.7 mi) south-east of the city of Nazca. Take the 1S/Pan American Highway south out of Nazca to the Carretera a Chauchilla (a road) and follow it to the end. Tour information can be found on several Peruvian travel websites. If you go wear a HEAVY sunscreen with a high number, at least 50! This place is in the deep desert -- when I visited (March 2016) it was very hot, very windy & very dry & the sun was the most intense I'd ever experienced! It's definitely worth it though, and if you have a good tour guide, they'll tell you incredible stuff about the place! There is a bathroom and attendants near a parking area."
15,Gocta Waterfall,"Provincia de Bongará, Peru",One of the world's tallest waterfalls wasn't revealed to the world at large until 2006.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gocta,"In 2005, German economist Stefan Ziemendorff, who was working on a wastewater project in the Amazonas province of Peru, took a break from his work to go for a hike in Peru’s Utcabamba valley in search of one of the region’s abundant pre-Incan ruins. When he crossed into a blind ravine, he spied something unexpected: a towering, two-tiered waterfall in the distance that hadn’t appeared on any map. The following March, after he had returned to the site with measuring equipment, Ziemendorff held a press conference to declare to the public that he had discovered the third-tallest waterfall in the world. The two tiers combined, the water plummets 2,531 feet, the height of well over two Eiffel Towers. Of course, Ziemendorff’s “discovery” wasn’t actually a discovery at all. The residents of Cocachimba had known about the waterfall since the 1950s. Their town was located practically right beneath it. They knew it as “Gocta,” after the sound made by howler monkeys in the region. But they had mostly avoided the towering waterfall due to superstitions surrounding it. The natural wonder simply blended into the background of their daily life. The pronouncement that Gocta was the third-largest waterfall in the world was met with controversy. Depending on your measurement (Do the multiple tiers count as one waterfall? Where does the waterfall begin, since it is mostly on a slope?), the falls could be anywhere from the third to the sixteenth largest in the world. No one is doubting the impressive majesty of Gocta Falls though. The spike in international interest has benefited Cocachimba as well, which now plays host to the many tourists who come to witness the falls."
16,Huacachina,"Ica, Peru",An unexpected desert oasis in South America.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/huacachina-oasis,"According to legend, a hunter caught a beautiful Incan princess walking in the sand dunes near present day Huacachina. As she walked and admired herself in a mirror she was carrying, her eyes caught his voyeuristic gaze. Shocked, the princess began to flee and dropped her mirror. It exploded into shards and the glass became a tiny pool in the desert, consuming the princess and turning her into a mermaid. Known as the “Oasis of America” it is one of the only true desert oases in the Americas. A lush island in a sea of sand, its watery pool ripples in shades of blue and green, completely encompassed by the brutal environment around it. Circled by palm trees, the verdant Peruvian watering hole has served as a tourist attraction for over 70 years. Dotted with restaurants and hotels, the Oasis was formerly a getaway for the upper class, escaping through the desert from nearby Ica. As of late, the small city, with a population of only 115, has become a hub of backpacking, dune buggy rides, and sandboarding, a sport aptly described by its name. In recent years, Huacachina has unfortunately begun to resemble the fleeing princess of its legendary origin. The water level of the oasis has dropped consistently, and the community has sustained it through pumping water from external sources. As budget concerns and restrictions on pumping have increased, the future of this South American oasis and legendary mermaid home remains unclear.  Five hours South of Lima, accessible from downtown Ica"
17,Skylodge,"Urubamba, Peru",Sleep in a glass pod dangling off a cliff.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skylodge,"On an Andean cliff overlooking Sacred Valley, there are three ovular glass pods dangling from the rock face. They’re not art, nor are they UFOs. They’re hotel rooms. The “Skylodge” is owned by a tourism company called Natura Vive, and these three suites comprise the entire luxury hotel. The three pods are the size of a tiny airplane cabin, and are transparent on all sides. They’re mostly bedroom and bathroom, with the first taken up entirely by a down bed and the second equipped with curtains for privacy. There’s not much to do in the pods, but then again, you’re not coming for comfort. Just to get there you have to hike up 1,200 feet of Via Ferrata or zipline in (for extra cost). Once there though, you’ll have a bird’s eye view of the valley below, the surrounding Andes, and condors circling in the open skies above."
18,Huayna Picchu,"Aguas Calientes, Peru","If you’ve ever seen a picture of Machu Picchu, then you’ve seen a picture of Huayna Picchu—you just didn’t realize it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/huayna-picchu,"Machu Picchu is a mind-boggling feat of engineering and megalithic architecture, improbably situated atop a difficult-to-reach Andean mountain summit. But whoa, hold on, what the heck is THAT? Up there, on the even taller peak overlooking Machu Picchu? That, my friend, is Huayna Picchu. Sitting 2720 meters (8920 feet) above sea level, and 360 meters (1180 feet) above Machu Picchu, Huayna Picchu was a sort of sacred suburb of the famous citadel of the Incas, consisting of temples and terraces that served as a residence for the high priest and “local virgins” (I know that sounds sketchy, but this was no doubt necessary for totally legitimate high priest business, like making sure the sun didn’t get stolen by a condor). The structures are set gingerly atop the conical peak or stuck to the steep mountainside, often ending in sudden, breathtakingly sheer drops. The site can be visited today via the original trail built by the Incas to facilitate travel between the main site and this astonishing satellite. The ascent is a hair-rising climb, at times slippery and/or fully exposed — here following stairs cut from the mountain itself, there requiring the sight-seer to clamber up on all fours. The way is reportedly manageable for any reasonably fit person, unless that reasonably fit person gets overwhelmingly terrified at the thought of stumbling off the side of a mountain. As if the whole thing is not already crazy enough, once you have visited the summit Huayna Picchu, you can proceed down the back side of the peak to check out the Temple of the Moon, which stands seemingly suspended on the sheer mountain face at the mouth of the Gran Caverna, another ritual site lined with typically exquisite Incan stonework that was most likely used to hold mummies. Access to Huayna Picchu is limited to 400 visitors per day, split into a 7:00am group and a 10:00am group. These controls were put in place to limit impact on the centuries-old trail, and to afford ample space for ongoing excavations at the top of the peak. The ascent takes around two hours, while the descent take 45 minutes to an hour — depending on how often you pause to stare, flabbergasted, at basically everything around you.  It is not possible to climb Huayna Picchu without a ticket for Machu Picchu. You need tickets for both. Walking sticks are not allowed, as they are prohibited throughout the whole Inca ruins. Also, don't bring big backpacks, as parts of the path lead through very narrow tunnels. There are nasty gnats inside Machu Picchu. Especially, on this long hike, it is recommended to bring bug repellant. As detailed above, there are two time slots each day. As Machu Picchu is often hidden in heavy mists in the morning, it is better to buy tickets for the 10:00 am group. The ruins down below will be most busy at noon as well, so you will avoid the crowds at the same time. As of 2017, stricter rules have been placed on visiting Machu Picchu to deal with the masses that visit every day. Visitors will not be allowed to enter without an authorized guide. There are already arrows to help control the flow of visitors but these will be more prominent. There are also changes to opening times for Machu Picchu, Huayna Picchu/Wayna Picchu, and Cerro Machu Picchu. Additionally, to climb Huayna Picchu, there is an age limit of 12 years or older. The age limit is imposed as the previously mentioned trek has a lot of slippery stone steps up a steep trail that requires the use of all hands, and hair-raising drop-offs."
19,Moray,"Urubamba, Peru",Huge stone depressions which may have acted as an Incan agricultural experiment.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moray,"Grouped together in Peru’s lush Cuzco region, the ringed Incan ruins known as Moray have long been a mystery, but it is looking more and more likely that the nested stone rings may have been part of a large-scale agricultural experiment. Unlike a number of the elaborate metropolises and statuary left behind by the Incan people, the rings at Moray are relatively simple but may have actually been an ingenious series of test beds. Descending in grass-covered, terraced rings, these rings of rings vary in size, with the largest ending in a depth of 30 meters (98 feet) deep and 220 meters (722 feet) wide. Studies have shown that many of the terraces contain soil that must have been imported from other parts of the region. The temperature at the top of the pits varies from that at the bottom by as much as 15ºC, creating a series of micro-climates that — not coincidentally — match many of the varied conditions across the Incan empire, leading to the conclusion that the rings were used as a test bed to see what crops could grow where. This proto–America’s Test Kitchen is yet another example of the Incan ingenuity that makes them one of the most remarkable declined societies in the planet’s history. 5 kilometers west of the pueblo of Maras. The easiest way to access the site is either via taxi or by tour group. It is also possible to take a local bus to the site from Urubamba."
20,Salt Pans of Maras,"Maras, Peru",This Peruvian canyon is filled with geometric salt pools that have been being harvested since the Incan empire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/salt-pans-of-maras,"Fed by a small local stream, the field of angular, interlocking earthen evaporation pools near the small Peruvian town of Maras has been providing local inhabitants with salt and visitors with a stunning view for generations. Cascading down a hillside valley like uneven steps, the Salinas de Maras (as they are known in the local tongue) were first created sometime in the 1400s by the Incas. While there is no transcribed record of the ponds’ creation, they seem to have been passed down and expanded by a small number of owners over hundreds of years. Salt is harvested from the patchwork of shallow pools via a process of evaporation. A natural spring feeds a salt-rich stream that flows down into the pools, which are then opened and dammed individually as needed. Once one of the pools is filled, the water is allowed to evaporate, and then the salt crystals are scraped off the ground with simple instruments. Then the whole process begins again. The area is not widely industrialized, and the salt is still just bagged up, packaged, and sold at market. Today there are about 3,000 pools that are still harvested by the community of local families who control the salt pans, the transport roads to the valley, and generally the entire salt production from the site, which remains much the same as as it was when the Inca discovered it over 1,000 years ago."
21,Puente Laguna Garzón,"Maldonado, Uruguay",Because sometimes the most efficient route from A to B isn't a straight line.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/puente-laguna-garzon,"When Uruguay’s Rocha and Maldonado counties sought to replace the tried-and-true way of crossing Laguna Garzón–by single-vehicle float rafts – they leapt straight for a plan that became one of the most immediately recognizable bridges in the world today. After six years of public hearings and negotiations with the local communities, Rafael Viñoly Architects (the same firm responsible for 432 Park Avenue’s delicate tower, the space-age Carrasco Airport, Princeton University’s athletics stadium, and more) found a way to meet the strict needs of the natural and cultural communities connected by the new bridge. The project’s success hinged upon its ability to incorporate the sensitive laws of the area, which, according to primary funder Eduardo Constantini, stipulate that just 35% of the stretch between the lagoons could be developed, while 50% must be devoted to green areas. These prolonged negotiations created a truly forward-thinking piece of engineering, opened to the public in September of 2015. The mile-long Laguna Garzón Bridge is among the most unusual in the world thanks to an empty, near-perfect circle at its center. Born equally of safety concerns – the road’s complementary one-way half-circles force motorists to slow down, thereby breaking up the mile-long stretch that otherwise might have been a tantalizing speedway – and of a need for amusement – it boasts an observation deck-and-fishing pier –  the bridge has already gained international acclaim for its design. Already crossed by more than 1,000 vehicles each day, the bridge is poised to become not only a significant upgrade from the lagoon’s floating predecessor, but is set to become a destination in its own right. Though it cost an estimated $11 million to complete, the bridge that created a “lagoon inside a lagoon” has since linked communities both locally and internationally, while responsibly creating an entry to the surrounding natural world where previously there had been none; in the modern world, where connectivity is everything and returns to nature are so rarely done, you decide whether a few million is a worthy price for such grace."
22,Café Brasilero,"Montevideo, Uruguay",The oldest café in Montevideo preserves its history as the city's bohemian hub.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cafe-brasilero,"This tiny cafe in Montevideo has played a bigger role in Uruguay’s history than its tiny size might indicate. Cafe Brasilero is the oldest cafe in the capital city, and has long been the center of its bohemian culture, attracting artists, writers, and musicians over its 140-year history. Tango master and singer Carlos Gardel frequented the cafe, and author Juan Carlos Onetti etched part his first novel right into the cafe’s tables. Perhaps the most notable and longest patron was writer Eduardo Galeano, who visited the place every Wednesday for over 20 years. A large photo of him hangs at the cafe’s entrance. Built in 1877, the Brazilian-themed cafe still retains much of its architectural history. The building has preserved its chairs, brass chandeliers and window frames outlining its Art Nouveau-style facade from that earlier era. The walls are also covered with photos, newspaper clippings, and paintings from the cafe’s past. It’s a past that was almost lost. The cafe closed in the 1980s, and remained closed for decades until it reopened in 2010 with an eye on preserving its story. It later became the first cafe to be declared of cultural interest by the city of Montevideo."
23,Palacio Salvo,"Montevideo, Uruguay","The design of the Palacio Salvo has been described as ""a lighthouse on top of a building.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palacio-salvo,"Inaugurated in 1928, Palacio Salvo appeared in the city landscape as a strange creature, one that has both delighted and disgusted architecture buffs for decades. Designed by the italian architect Mario Palanti, the building has everything you could imagine, from a cinema to a hotel. The palace was originally topped with a lighthouse with a parabolic mirror of 920mm, reaching approximately 100km, but the light was later removed in favor of an antenna that gave the 27-floor building its eventual height of 100 meters. With this addition it was once thought to be the tallest building in South America, but the antenna has since been removed, demoting it to simply a fantastic display of architecture. Originally intended as a luxury hotel, the palace never managed to fulfill that purpose, and acts instead as a very elaborate collection of private residences and offices. The vast number of rooms in the gothic palace vary in condition and are said to be inhabited by an equally varied clientele. While wandering around the building you can supposedly bump into a three-million-dollar music studio, a radio station, and ladies of the night briskly doing business. Palacio Salvo is like a living organism and a major attraction if you are visiting Montevideo. Though tourists are not allowed to get into the building (sometimes you can find someone nice that might invite you) just viewing the palace from the Plaza Independencia is worth a visit to the site.  The pin is in the wrong place. It should be next to Independence Plaza."
24,Plaza de Toros,"Colonia Del Sacramento, Uruguay","Abandoned bull fighting ring, slowly falling apart in Uruguay.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/plaza-de-toros,"Though bullfighting is associated most closely with Spain, bullfighting had a brief life across the ocean in the South American country of Uruguay. Built-in 1908 as part of the larger Real de San Carlos Tourist Complex, the Moorish style bull ring or “Plaza de Toros” opened for locals in 1910, with bulls – as well as bullfighters Bombita Grande and his brother Bombita Chicos – shipped all the way from Spain to perform the in the bloody entertainment. The ring itself was 50m in diameter and had seating for over 8,000 spectators. People came all the way from Argentina to see the spectacle, however, there were only eight bullfights held here between January and March 1910 before a government decree banned them forever. The Real de San Carlos complex included not only the bull ring, but a hotel-casino, a ferry dock (for carrying tourists from nearby Buenos Aires), and a huge “pelote basque” building (“fronton”). The casino began operating after the bullfights were forbidden, and the whole complex only operated until 1917. Today only a racetrack from the complex is still in use. Technically, it is forbidden to enter the abandoned bull ring for safety reasons. Update as of December 2021: This location has been renovated and is partially open to the public."
25,Zooilógico del Futuro,Uruguay,"The Sun, Moon, and stars peacefully coexist with animals, humans, and their tools at this surprising sculpture park.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zooilogico-del-futuro,"About four miles south of Trinidad, Uruguay, on Ruta 3, stands a zoo of the future. Animals like deer, ducks, and capybaras are positioned alongside tools like knives, axes, and saws, all carved from wrought iron by local artist Martin Arregui. The “Zooilógico del Futuro” was inaugurated in 1991 as part of a campaign for the preservation of flora and fauna. The sculpture park, which includes 13 pieces, depicts the dangers of letting indiscriminate hunting and other practices that affect wildlife continue unchecked. The metal sculptures, which are about 10 to 12 feet tall, display various combinations of animals and hand tools, and look a little like a number of shadow puppets merged together. While each sculpture may have more than one animal, they seem to only have one hand tool per sculpture. The sun, moon, and the stars peacefully co-exist with animals, humans, and their implements in the parks. You have to be driving on Ruta 3 through northwestern Uruguay when you are suddenly surprised by this amazing and beautiful site."
26,Teatro Solís,"Montevideo, Uruguay",This beautiful example of neoclassical architecture is one of Uruguay's most treasured cultural gems.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/teatro-solis,"In the early 19th century, the citizens of Montevideo wanted to create a public space to meet and express their social and political ideas. They envisioned a cultural hub unique to South America but rivaling the art and architecture of European city centers. And so the magnificent Teatro Solís was born. The theater was designed by the Italian architect Carlo Zucchi using timber and marble brought over from Europe and stored away while war raged in Uruguay. After years of delay, the theater finally opened in 1856 with a rendition of Verdi’s opera Ernani. Located in Montevideo’s Plaza Independencia, the building is a perfect example of neoclassical, Old World architectural splendor. The design—including the elegant façade (which has been completely restored), carved canopy and pillars, and elliptical interior—was heavily influenced by Italian architecture. The similarities can be seen in the Teatro Carlo in Genoa, the Milanese Teatro alla Scala, and most of all the Teatro Metastasio di Prato near Florence. As Uruguay’s oldest and most renowned cultural theater, Teatro Solís has launched the careers of many Uruguayan actors, singers, and musicians, as well as attracting famous performers from around the world. Headliners over the years include the actresses Sarah Bernhardt, Margarita Xirgú, and Vivien Leigh; tenors Francesco Tamagno and Enrico Caruso; Spanish classical guitarist Andrés Segovia; dancer Isadora Duncan; and pianist Arthur Rubinstein.  Teatro Solís is located on Buenos Aires street at the corner of Bartolome Mitre. The theater is open evenings from Tuesday through Sunday, and closed on Mondays. The venue currently hosts music, operas, plays, comedy, and other performances by Uruguayan and international artists. Guided tours of the theater are also available throughout the day."
27,Fuente de los Candados,"Montevideo, Uruguay",Where sweethearts leave their love locks in the Uruguayan capital.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fuente-de-los-candados,"The Fuente de los Candados (Fountain of Locks) is a stone fountain on a street corner in Montevideo. It would be a fairly forgettable fountain under normal circumstances, were it not for the hundreds of padlocks attached to its surrounding railing. When the owners of Bar Facal, one of the most famous restaurants in the city, installed a stone fountain on their street corner, they had no idea it would become one of the city’s most enduring symbols of love. The owners had imported the small fountain, made from volcanic stone, from Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. It sat in storage for 15 years until they finally decided to install it outside the bar, right on the corner of Avenida 18 de Julio and Paseo Yi, a busy spot in the Uruguayan capital. To protect the fountain, a metal railing was erected all around it. And soon, something strange began to happen. Padlocks started to appear, attached to the railing and typically inscribed with the initials of two people. Initially, the owners of Bar Facal were baffled by this, but a bit of research revealed the cause: The fountain had contracted a serious case of the love locks. This international phenomenon had struck bridges, gates, fences and monuments across the globe—a symbol of love for sweethearts, but the bane of many a municipal authority. And now it had arrived in Montevideo. The owners of Bar Facal were happy to let people place locks on the fountain’s fence (it was good for business, after all), and soon it was covered in hundreds of padlocks left primarily by loved-up tourists who were familiar with the craze. After a while, the owners decided to put a plaque by the fountain, explaining, in Spanish and English, the “legend” of the “young fountain,” and how any lock placed here with the initials of the two lovers would ensure their love lasts forever.  The Fuente de los Candados is located on the corner of 18 de Julio and Paseo Yi in the Centro district of Montevideo, outside Bar Facal. If you want to buy a lock, ask in the nearby kiosk."
28,Fortaleza del Cerro,"Montevideo, Uruguay",This historic fort overlooks Montevideo and appears on Uruguay’s coat of arms.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fortaleza-del-cerro,"Fortaleza del Cerro sits atop the highest hill in Montevideo. For more than a century, it has looked over the city and the bay, a witness to many of the events that have shaped the Uruguayan capital. In 1806, British forces began prowling the Río de la Plata, an estuary between Argentina and Uruguay controlled by the Spanish colonial Viceroyalty. The British invaded and occupied Buenos Aires in June of that year, captured the city of Montevideo in February 1807, and again invaded Buenos Aires a few months later. None of these attempts at taking permanent control of Spanish possessions along the Río de la Plata were ultimately successful, but they certainly made the Spanish rethink their defenses. In 1809, Francisco Javier de Elío, a Spanish soldier and then governor of Montevideo, ordered the construction of fortifications on top of Cerro de Montevideo. At 433 feet (132 meters) above sea level, the summit of Cerro de Montevideo offered a strategic vantage point above the city and overlooking the bay. It was also home to a lighthouse, built in 1802, which itself served an important role not only for navigation but for sending warning messages to ships out at sea using a system of flags. Initially, only a limited set of simple fortifications were to be built around the lighthouse. But the need to defend the bay required more than a lighthouse, and so the Spanish decided to build a fortress whose walls could accommodate larger artillery pieces. Construction of the fort began in 1809 and was finished in 1811. The first artillery test took place on February 25, 1811, with the new fortress firing its four cannons and two howitzers out into the bay. It was not long until the Fortaleza del Cerro became embroiled in the colonial struggles of the era. Cities and settlements along the Río de la Plata had been rising up against their colonial overloads since the May Revolution of 1810 in Buenos Aires. In 1814, patriot troops besieged Montevideo and took it from the Spanish loyalists, marking the end of the Spanish presence in Uruguay (and also making the Fortaleza del Cerro the last Spanish fort built in the country). But Uruguay’s fight for independence was far from over. In January 1817, the fortress was overwhelmed when a force of 10,000 Portuguese troops took Montevideo, and the Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil took control of Uruguay. The Brazilian Empire then became independent of Portugal in 1822, and the Brazilians found themselves in charge of Montevideo. Patriot forces again surrounded Montevideo in 1825, and took the fortress from the Brazilians on February 9, 1826. In 1828, Uruguay was officially recognized as an independent state. A year later it adopted a new coat of arms, with the Fortaleza del Cerro featured in its upper right quarter. Then came the Uruguayan Civil War, known as the Guerra Grande, which lasted from 1839 to 1851. The fort never fell during this period, but the lighthouse was damaged and later repaired. The next major event in this lengthy period of change and uncertainty came in 1870, when the fort was taken during the Revolución de las Lanzas (Revolution of the Lances), an armed movement led by Timoteo Aparicio, leader of the National Party of Uruguay. The taking of the fortress during this last conflict raised doubts as to its continued effectiveness in defense of the city. In 1885, Máximo Santos, then President of Uruguay, ordered a feigned attack on the fortress as a test of its abilities. Unfortunately, no one told the garrison about this, and the fortress opened up with live fire on what it assumed were hostile forces. Luckily for all involved, no one was killed in the messy incident. That was pretty much the end of the Fortaleza del Cerro’s role as a functioning military fortress. It served as a military prison from 1895 to 1907, and was declared a National Monument in 1931. A military museum was established inside the fort in 1939, and since then its primary role has been as a tourist attraction, a fittingly tranquil retirement for a fort with a long and turbulent history.  Fortaleza del Cerro, also known as Fortaleza General Artigas, is located on a hill just to the west of Montevideo and across the bay from Cuidad Vieja (the Old Town). You can get there by taking bus 124 or 125 from the city center, which will drop you off at the Terminal Cerro, from where you can take a taxi, take the 18L bus, or walk to the fort. The fort is open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the summer, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in winter. The entrance fee is 20 Uruguayan pesos, which is less than $1 US."
29,Isla de Lobos,Uruguay,This small island off the coast of Uruguay hosts the largest colony of sea lions and fur seals in the southern hemisphere.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/isla-de-lobos,"Off the coast of Uruguay, five miles (eight kilometers) south of the sea resort of Punta del Estelies is the small Isla de Lobos. The island is located along the outer limit of the Rio de la Plata estuary and belongs to a natural reserve with Gorriti Island. The island was known to the first Spanish explorers in the area around the 16th-century. In 1858, the Uruguayan government built the first lighthouse on the island, which was restored in 1906 and was turned into the country’s first automated lighthouse in 2001. Since 1992, the island has become part of the Coastal Islands National Park in order to protect the local fauna. The island is home to the largest colony of sea lions and fur seals in the southern and western hemispheres. In a 2005 census, over 1,500 sea lions and 250,000 fur seals were counted on Isla de Lobos. While these animals are clearly the main population of the area, other species visit the island as well such as elephant seals and various species of birds. In addition, the island is a whale-watching spot, as Southern right whales often pass by the area when wintering around the Uruguayan coast. This is also one of the few places in the country where orcas are present."
30,Grutas del Palacio,"Flores, Uruguay",This wonderful rock formation constitutes the first geopark in Uruguay.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grutas-del-palacio,"The Gruta del Palacio (“Palace Cave”) is an ancient rock formation located in Central Uruguay, near the small town of Trinidad. This wonderful geological feature is composed of sandstone and sedimentary rock. The natural wonder formed around 70 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period, later solidifying into its current appearance during the Paleocene. The peculiar cave is formed by an upper shell of sandstone sustained by multiple 6.5 feet (2-meters) tall natural columns that create a structure that resembles the porticoes of palaces, hence the name. These features create a large labyrinth of caves, of which only a small portion is accessible to the public. It has been suggested that the caves could have been inhabited by the indigenous population of the region during prehistoric times. Some local legends are linked to this rock formation, but no definitive proof of ancient human presence has been found. First studied in 1877, the caves were explored during the 20th-century, and in 2013, the site became the first geopark in Uruguay and the second in all of South America. It is now being considered for possible inclusion onto the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites."

32,Estadio Centenario,"Montevideo, Uruguay",This historic stadium was built to host the first-ever FIFA World Cup.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/estadio-centenario,"Built to host the first-ever FIFA World Cup in 1930, Montevideo’s Estadio Centenario is today considered one of the most historic soccer stadiums in the world. When the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) announced plans to hold the first World Cup in 1930, six countries applied to host the event: Italy, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Uruguay. Despite being the only non-European country to apply, Uruguay won the bid. At the time, the Uruguayan national team was a soccer powerhouse and the reigning Olympic champion. The country would also celebrate 100 years of independence in 1930, a historic landmark not lost on FIFA. But not everyone was keen on holding the inaugural World Cup in South America, especially the Europeans. Of the 13 nations that took part, nine were from the Americas. Many European nations rejected invitations because of the three-week voyage required to get to South America. And some were simply appalled that the inaugural event wasn’t being held in Europe. England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, meanwhile, had withdrawn from FIFA in 1928 due to a dispute over payments to amateur players, and so were ineligible (although six British born players did manage to get into the USA team). In the end, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, and Romania were the only Old World nations to attend. In 1929, while FIFA worked on the attendance issue, Uruguay had a pressing problem of its own: Where exactly was it going to host the event? A handful of small stadiums already existed in Montevideo, but something larger was required. And so, in 1929, workers, many of whom were immigrants, began construction on the 90,000-capacity Estadio Centenario, named in honor of the country’s 100 years of independence. It was completed in just nine months, but that was still five days too late. The rainy season and a hectic construction schedule had caused delays, and so the opening matches of the inaugural World Cup took place at Estadio Parque Central and Estadio Pocitos, which at the time had capacities of 20,000 and 1,000 respectively. After a frustrating few days, Estadio Centenario—at the time the largest football stadium outside the British Isles— finally hosted its first-ever match. It was a positive start, with Uruguay beating Peru 1-0. The stadium went on to host 10 of the 18 matches in the World Cup, including both semi-finals and the final. And on July 30, 1930, Uruguay won the first ever FIFA World Cup when they defeated Argentina 4-2 in the final. Estadio Centenario has remained the home ground of the Uruguayan national team ever since that triumphant beginning. It has also hosted the Copa América on four occasions. As the stadium is not owned by a club, other clubs can rent it for big games. As such, it often hosts high-profile national club matches and home-turf encounters in the Copa Libertadores. On July 18, 1983, FIFA declared the Estadio Centenario a “Historical Monument of World Football,” the only stadium in the world to hold this title. Since its inauguration in 1930, the stadium hasn’t changed all that much. The capacity has dropped to around 60,000 as standing areas have been replaced with seating, and the stadium now houses the Museo de Futbol, a museum dedicated to the history of Uruguayan football. Apart from that, it has largely remained the same. That, however, could change in the not too distant future. Uruguay wants to host the 2030 World Cup, 100 years after it hosted the inaugural event, so any bid it makes will have the weight of history behind it. But to strengthen the bid, Uruguay will need to invest in the national stadium. In April 2018, Uruguay’s sports secretary Fernando Caceres announced that six projects were being considered for a new stadium. In each of these proposals, the iconic 328-foot Tower of Tributes that rises up from the stadium’s Olympic Tribune stand will be preserved. Some of the proposals, however, require the demolition of the stadium to make room for a new one, an idea that hasn’t been ruled out by Caceres. Understandably, many Uruguayans are vehemently opposed to this idea.  Estadio Centenario is located in the Parque Batlle neighborhood in central Montevideo. You can get there by taking any bus to the Tres Cruces bus terminal, from where it’s a 10- to 15-minute walk to the stadium. From the historic center, you can catch bus 115 or 143 and get off at the corner of Av. Dr. Americo Ricaldoni and Av. Italia, right next to the stadium. Check local listings for events, including soccer matches and concerts. The Museo de Futbol is open Monday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m."
33,Mausoleo de Artigas,"Montevideo, Uruguay",The remains of Uruguayan hero José Artigas lie beneath a monument in Montevideo’s main square.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mausoleo-de-artigas,"In the center of Montevideo’s main square stands an imposing statue of José Artigas, one of Uruguay’s most celebrated national heroes. And beneath this statue lies his mausoleum, dutifully protected by a guard of honor. At the center of Plaza Independencia, the most important square in the capital city, you’ll find a bronze equestrian statue of Artigas, the soldier and revolutionary leader who is regarded as the father of Uruguayan independence. The statue stands atop a large, grey granite base, the entire monument weighing 30 tons and reaching a height of 56 feet. You can’t miss it when you enter the plaza, but you might miss what’s hidden beneath it: the Mausoleo de Artigas, an underground chamber that holds the remains of the revolutionary leader. The mausoleum was inaugurated in 1977 during the de facto presidency of Aparicio Méndez, a non-democratically elected politician who rose to power during the civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay. Understandably, there was no shortage of irony when a political figure like Méndez inaugurated the mausoleum of a soldier who fought for freedom and democracy. And because the mausoleum was opened during a dictatorship, the tomb itself is conspicuously short of the quotes that Artigas was so famous for. The interior walls of the somber, dimly lit mausoleum are covered with inscriptions in reference to the events of Artigas’ life, but his actual words were deemed too inflammatory by the dictatorship, and so none appear in the mausoleum. At the heart of the mausoleum stands the urn containing the remains of Artigas, housed in glass and illuminated from above. Day and night, the remains are guarded by the Blandengues de Artigas, a military regiment named in honor of Artigas in 1910. Two Blandengues always stand on guard at either side of the urn, watching over the hallowed resting place of Uruguay’s national hero.  The Mausoleo de Artigas is located beneath the Artigas Monument at the center of Plaza Independencia, which lies between the Ciudad Vieja (Old City) and downtown Montevideo. Two black granite staircases lead down to the mausoleum on opposing sides of the monument. Visiting hours are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Entrance is free."

Its most striking feature is the entrance facing Rambla Mahatma Gandhi, from which a replica of the iconic Greek sculpture the Winged Victory of Samothrace emerges from a round brick tower, crowned by a coat of arms. Pittamiglio was an Uruguayan architect and engineer. He built this house in 1910-1911. The history of the castle is surrounded by stories—some claim that it once housed the Holy Grail. Inside, the building is filled with alchemical, Templar, Rosicrucian, and Masonic symbols."
35,Colonia del Sacramento Lighthouse,"Colonia Del Sacramento, Uruguay","Constructed on the ruins of a convent, this tower saved countless lives.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/colonia-del-sacramento-lighthouse,"Rising 112 feet above the city’s historic quarter, construction on this lighthouse began in 1845. Designed by soldiers, the project was placed on-hold due to the outbreak of civil war. Work wasn’t officially completed until 1857. Built-in 1690, the Convent of San Francisco Javier was close to the waterfront of this Portuguese settlement. The chapel’s tower served as an important landmark for boats navigating the Rio de la Plata. In 1705, the convent was destroyed by a fire, however, all was not lost. Eventually, the tower was reconstructed to create the lighthouse. The remaining convent walls added structural stability and are still visible today. The Rio de la Plata is actually an estuary formed by the confluence of the Paraná and Uruguay Rivers. Both are important trade routes connecting much of central South America to the outside world. Strong winds from the Atlantic have caused many shipwrecks, so many that the Rio de la Plata has been called “the hell of sailor’s” and is known as a naval graveyard. The top of the lighthouse provides a nice vantage point to view the city. The city’s historic quarter is a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
36,The Drowned Church of Potosi,"Uribante, Venezuela",A town church once nearly submerged by the damming of a river is now hauntingly visible as the water recedes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/drowned-church-potosi,"Between 1985 and 2008, fishermen and daytrippers traveling by boat along the lake formed by the Uribante Reservoir in Táchira, Venezuela would be presented with an unusual and eerie sight: a lone and mildewed cross rising crookedly out of the water, clearly attached to a foundation leading to something anchoring it – something big, deep beneath the surface. In 2008 however, the cross started to rise higher and higher out of the water, revealing more of the gothic structure below. The unsettling cross was literally just the tip of something much more massive. In reality, the structure was not rising out of the water, but rather the water of the reservoir was receding, revealing what the lake had concealed for more than two decades. By 2010, the water had receded almost entirely, revealing a large stretch of flat land, and a towering gothic church that was once nearly submerged. The church belonged to the city of Potosi, which in 1985 was purposefully flooded by the damming of a nearby river to create hydroelectric power. All of Potosi’s citizens had to be relocated, their homes and town abandoned, and for 20 years all that remained of their former life was the cross at the top of the church’s steeple, once reaching high into the sky, and then brought down to earth and nearly – but not completely – drowned. It’s not uncommon for a city to be flooded by the building of a dam. St. Thomas, Nevada now rests at the bottom of Lake Mead near Las Vegas. The same happened to Vilarinho das Furnas, a 2,000-year-old city in Portugal. Other times, it’s a natural disaster that dams a nearby river unexpectedly, as it did with the Thistle ghost town in Utah; or the ocean rises and simply never recedes, which caused sunken pirate city of Port Royal, Jamaica. Less common is the phenomenon of a building, in this case the steeple of a single church, remaining above the surface of the water. It has long been remarkable, and a powerful symbol for some, that the cross adorning the top of this structure remained proudly above the surface, marking the location of the former city. However, severe droughts and water shortages in Venezuela have resulted in the effective draining of the reservoir, revealing the church once again. Erosion and water damage makes it look ancient and wild, and although the impressive facade and steeple remain, the body of the church has been worn away, resulting in the haunting effect of seeing a church which appears to be whole and beautiful from the front, only to reveal that it is gutted and empty from the side. For years the cross emerging out of the water has been symbolic for the spirit of a town washed away, and now the revealed and hollowed church provides an eerie metaphor for a town that had its citizens removed."
37,Relampago del Catatumbo,Venezuela,This everlasting lightning storm may be the world's largest generator of ozone.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/relampago-del-catatumbo,"There’s something strange in the air where the Catatumbo River flows into Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela… For 140 to 160 nights out of the year, for 10 hours at a time, the sky above the river is pierced by almost constant lightning, producing as many as 280 strikes per hour. Known as the “Relámpago del Catatumbo,” (relámpago means lightning in Spanish) this lightning storm has been raging, on and off, for as long as people can remember. The area has been labeled as the most electric place on Earth and it even made it to the Guinness Book of World Records. It was first written about in the 1597 poem “The Dragontea” by Lope de Vega. De Vega tells of Sir Francis Drake’s 1595 attempt to take the city of Maracaibo by night, only to have his plans foiled when the lightning storm’s flashes gave away his position to the city’s defenders. This happened again on July 24, 1823, when, during the Venezuelan War of Independence, Spanish ships were revealed by the lightning and defeated by the Simón Bolívar’s upstart navy. In fact, the lightning, visible from 400 kilometers away, is so regular that it’s been used as a navigation aid by ships and is known among sailors as the “Maracaibo Beacon.” Interestingly, generally little to no sound accompanies this fantastic light show, as the lightning moves from cloud to cloud—far, far above the ground. For many years, it was unknown exactly why this area—and this area alone—should produce such regular lightning. One theory held that ionized methane gas rising from the Catatumbo bogs met with storm clouds coming down from the Andes, helping to create the perfect conditions for a lightning storm. Now, though, scientists attribute the lightning to a regular, low-lying air current coming from the Caribbean; they’ve set up an early warning system based on forecasts of when lightning storms will come. The highest concentration of lightning strikes can be usually observed in October, and the lowest in January and February. With a total of roughly 1.2 million lightning discharges per year, the Relampago del Catatumbo is thought to be the world’s greatest producer of ozone. As the lightning rips through the air, it produces nitrogen oxide, which is broken down by sunlight and converted into ozone. It is unclear, however, whether these molecules ever end up in the protective ozone layer high above the planet."
38,Mount Roraima,"Gran Sabana, Venezuela","This ""floating island"" plateau sits 7,671 feet above the forest floor.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mount-roraima,"It might look like it’s straight out of a sci-fi movie, but this natural wonder is completely real, and fully awe-inspiring. Mount Roraima is surrounded by three different countries (Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana) whose borderlines intersect on the massive shelf, with all four sides being sheer 400-meter high cliffs. While its cliff walls are only scalable by the most experienced of climbers, there is a path up the mountain’s natural ramp-like path (usually a two-day hike). However, the mountain is worth a visit for more reasons than its impressive cliffs. Mount Roraima, part of Venezuela’s 30000-square-kilometer Canaima National Park, is the site of the highest peak of the country of Guyana’s Highland Range. The mountains of this range, including Roraima, are considered to be some of the oldest geological formations known, some dating back to two billion years ago. Its near daily rains have also created a unique ecosystem which includes several endemic species, such as a unique carnivorous pitcher plant, and some of the highest waterfalls in the world. Culturally, the mountain has long held significance to the indigenous people of the area and features prominently in their myths and folklore. This remote landscape of jungle and cliffs has inspired the dinosaur infested landscapes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s novel The Lost World, and the dramatic waterfalls dubbed “Paradise Falls” in the 2009 Pixar film Up."

The shop offers the world’s largest selection of ice cream flavors, and there are seemingly no limits to the variety of tastes for the most adventurous of palettes, all of them all-natural. “If you eat the spaghetti with cheese ice cream, it has real spaghetti and cheese in it,” says manager, Jose Ramiraz. After years of working for large ice cream companies, Portuguese immigrant, Manuel Da Silva Oliveira realized he could expand the horizons of ice cream, infusing it with all kinds of eclectic and exotic flavors, and opened Heladeria Coromoto in 1980. His first attempt was avocado, and he wasted over 50kg of ice cream trying to perfect it. Now, it’s a local favorite, and can be paired with a number of flavors such as sweetcorn or black bean, as well as mango or coconut to bring out its sweetness. The shop serves locals and tourists from all over. There are about 60 flavors offered in the shop at any given time and the flavors are changed according to the season. Among the bizarre selections, one can find more traditional flavors like chocolate or vanilla. The house special is called, “Pabellon Criollo” and combines the flavors of the traditional Venezuelan meal of beef, rice, plantain, cheese, and black beans. Being in Venezuela, there are also plenty made with rum, such as rum-and-raisin. Some odd-named flavors include British Airways, I’m Sorry, Darling, and the blue-hued Viagra Hope, which is made of honey and pollen, but shares the bright, sky blue shade of its namesake. Update as of July 2022: The store is temporarily closed."
40,Sarisarinama,"Sucre, Venezuela",Massive sinkholes on a mountain in one of the most remote places in Venezuela.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sarisarinama,"Besides being one of the most remote locations in all of Venezuela, Sarisarinama is one of the most bizarre landscapes in the world. High in the clouds on a tepui, or tabletop mountain, are four giant sinkholes, each a near-perfect circle, cutting through the foliage-covered mountain. The largest of the sinkholes is 1150 feet wide and 1000 feet deep. Although the other three well-known holes are not quite as large, they are equally impressive and drop off in the midst of the primeval forest on top of the tepui. Adding to the mystery of the place is the local legend that gave the tepui its name. According to natives to the area, a flesh-eating evil spirit lived on the mountain, who made the sound Sari Sari when he was consuming human meat. Although there are not any actual person-eating spirits on the mountain, the desolation atop the mountain still adds a level of eeriness to the surroundings. Having only recently been introduced to the sinkholes on Sarisarinama, visitors to the area are often shocked at how the dense jungle pushes all the way to the edge of the sinkholes, making their presence more dramatic and even more unnerving. Since the holes were spotted in 1961, many expeditions into the jungle have occurred. Whether cursed by spirits or just unprepared for the harsh jungle landscape, many of these have ended in disaster, including one fateful mission in which a number of men became trapped after lowering themselves into one of the larger sinkholes. Considering the thickness of the jungle and the dangerous unknowns of Sarisarinama, forays into the area are not recommended without a guide, and a bit of luck to keep yourself from falling 1000 feet into one of the massive sinkholes."
41,Dr. Gottfried Knoche and his mummies,"Caracas, Venezuela",Ruins of the laboratory where a mysterious doctor invented an embalming fluid and stored his mummies.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dr-gottfried-knoche-and-his-mummies,"Gottfried Knoche, born in Halberstadt , Germany in 1813, was a German surgeon famous for inventing an embalming fluid with which he created dozens of mummified bodies… including his own. Knoche emigrated from Germany to Venezuela in 1840 to settle in La Guaira. There he embedded himself in the coastal population and founded the San Juan de Dios Hospital sometime between 1854 and 1856. Once settled, Knoche brought his wife and began work in the city as a doctor. The doctor quickly gained a reputation as a charitable person by caring for poor patients without charge while tirelessly fighting against the cholera epidemic that afflicted the region in those years. Knoche’s fascination and persistence in avoiding the inexorable process of bodies decomposing after death, he began to experiment with unclaimed bodies from the federal war (not a terribly unusual practice for physicians of the time), returning them on horseback from San Juan de Dios hospital to his laboratory located in the Hacienda Buena Vista, at the Palmar del Picacho in Galipán. Over time Knoche created a liquid that could be injected into corpses that would keep the body pristine without necessitating the removal of their organs. In this fashion, the doctor kept several bodies mummified for study in his laboratory. Knoche had anticipated the arrival of his own death, and made sure that Amalie Weismann, his nurse in charge of administering the “mummification serum” (embalming fluid, as we know it today) to the bodies, had prepared doses for his own infinite preservation. He then apparently had Amalie inject it into his still living body before locking himself in a mausoleum for all eternity. Dr. Thomas Lander, a famous Venezuelan journalist and politician, and Francisco Linares Alcántara, president of Venezuela from 1878-1879 were both said to have been preserved by Knoche. The mummy of Landers theoretically sat in the entrance of the Landers house for some 40 years before he was buried. In 1929 an expedition to the Knoche family farm found that many of the mummies had been removed from their niches and were scattered on the ground. A picture was taken at the time prominently featuring one of these mummies. Amelie, the doctor’s faithful nurse and aide, followed Knoche to his grave in 1926. Ever since, the Knoche’s homestead has been slowly engulfed by vegetation and pillaged by vandals, looters and medical students either seeking the secret of the embalming fluid or attracted by the myth of this dark work. Some of the exterior walls, door frames of the main entrance, stables, a tank, the laboratory and oven are all that remain. To this day, the exact composition of the substance used by Knoche to preserve his corpses has never been discovered. The closest scientists have come to approximating the concoction has been a potent solution based on aluminum chloride."

The monument is located in the city of Caracas, Venezuela, in Colinas de Bello Monte, where Mattar lives, and where he started construction in 1963 of the Monument for the Peace.

43,The Helix,"Caracas, Venezuela",This former shopping center now acts as the eccentric lair of the Venezuelan secret police and their shadow prison.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-helix-caracas-venezuela,"Rising up out of the Venezuelan slums, the eye-catching complex known as The Helix (El Helicoide) looks like something out of a super-villain’s dream and with its intelligence headquarters, mysterious prison, and general air of secrecy, it acts the part as well. Designed to be an ultra-modern retail destination, construction began on the Helix complex in 1956. The tiered shopping center was set to have a five-star hotel, a park, and floors of luxury shopping. The massive mall would have allowed people to drive their cars right into the complex and park right near the shops they wanted to visit. Built on a pre-existing hill in Caracas, the pyramid-like structure jutted impressively from the surrounding neighborhood. Unfortunately funding for the project ran dry in the 1960’s and work on the site slowed to a trickle despite the inclusion of a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome which was placed like a cap atop the hill. Eventually the Helix was completed as six concentric levels of the building were built onto the shelves carved out of the hill. With the dream of an easily accessible mecca of retail and luxury scuttled due to money woes, the Venezuelan state began using the space for a number of its agencies. This centralization of government power led to a damaging bombing in 1992. However the structure was rebuilt and the whole complex is now home to the Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services (DISIP). This secretive intelligence agency headquarters in the eccentric building and has also started a not-so-secret prison at the site. Like many such facilities, the prisoners are often held without charge and have reported myriad human rights abuses from within the iconic building. In the real world, most shady government agencies try to remain under the radar, but the shadow agents of The Helix seem to have taken a page from a different book. Probably a comic book."
44,Mount Roraima Tripoint Marker,"Santa Elena de Uairén, Venezuela","A pyramidal marker where the borders of Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana meet on top of Mount Roraima.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mount-roraima-tripoint-marker,"Signs of human activity are hard to come by on the plateau of Mount Roraima, a sandstone tepui, or table-top mountain, that rises out of the jungle below. But on the mesa sits a small man-made marker that marks that spot at which the borders of Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana meet. The 12-square-mile summit area of Mount Roraima was unexplored until 1884. What at first appeared to be a barren landscape above the teeming jungle was soon discovered to harbor many fascinating plants that had adapted to the environment, dotted with caves and canyons. One of the rare signs of a human activity on the tepui (meaning “house of the gods” in the native Pemon language) is a whitewashed stone pyramidal structure. About seven feet tall, the marker sits on the tripoint where the borders of Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana all meet. The Mount Roraima tripoint marker was erected during a joint expedition between Venezuela, Brazil and British Guiana in 1931 (Guyana achieved its independence from the United Kingdom on May 26, 1966). One side of the marker is clearly marked with the word “Brasil” and the nation’s national shield, and the other with “Venezuela.” The Venezuelan side also bears a bronze plaque and the geographical marker “BV-0,” referring to the zero point between the two national boundaries (with no mention of Guyana). The Guyanese side, meanwhile, is almost blank save for some barely legible and crudely done lettering (you can see it in this 360-degree image). Even this isolated table-top mountain couldn’t escape political squabbling. Venezuela and Guyana have been engaged in a long-running border dispute stemming from Venezuela’s claims to the western portion of Guyana, which it claims as the Venezuelan region of Guayana Esequiba (and which, if recognized internationally, would push Guyana off the top of Mount Roraima and then some). Hence the “BV-0” and Venezuela’s stanch lack of recognition of Guyana’s place on the tripiont marker. But as things stand, any adventurous soul who manages to reach the summit area of Mount Roraima can wrap his or her arms around the tripoint marker and claim to be in three different countries at once.  The only non-technical route to the top of Mount Roraima is via the Paraitepui route from Venezuela. All other approaches involve climbing gear and a healthy dose of experience. Tour companies organize six-day guided hikes to the summit from the nearby town of Santa Elena de Uairen in Venezuela. If you hate trekking and have money to burn, it's possible to charter a helicopter up to the plateau."
45,Tower of David,"Caracas, Venezuela",The world's tallest slum.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tower-of-david,"At 45 stories, the Torre de David, or Tower of David, in Caracas, Venezuela is the world’s tallest slum. Officially called the Centro Financiero Confinanzas, the skyscraper was originally going to be a bank. Construction started in 1990, but with the Venezuelan banking crisis, as well as the unexpected death of developer J. David Brillembourg (whose name was taken to grace the building), the work stopped in 1994. After that, it was abandoned, until in 2007 when squatters moved in. While the Tower of David is often seen as a hotbed for crime, it is home for around 2,500 individuals. With a pooled rent, they’ve created their own electrical grid and aqueduct in a building that is still basically a concrete shell, and which was never intended for residential use. However, despite the community that was formed there in response to the ongoing housing crisis, there is always the danger of the towering height from the unfinished floors and walls that gape over the city. Update: In 2014, the inhabitants of the tower were evicted and moved to various government housings around the city. The tower is now empty except for a few offices in the first few floors."
46,Esfera Caracas,"Caracas, Venezuela",One of the most iconic sculptures in Caracas looks like a large orange ball suspended in the air.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/esfera-caracas,"The Esfera Caracas, or Caracas Sphere, is a kinetic sculpture made from a series of aluminum rods, which together form what looks like a large orange ball hanging in the air. In 1994, the acclaimed Venezuelan sculptor and painter Jesús Soto began making inquiries about one of his sculptures, which had seemingly disappeared. The piece—a kinetic sculpture resembling an orange sphere—had been commissioned by the Federal District Governor’s Office, but had never seen the light of day. With the help of some friends in high places, Soto, famous for his op art and kinetic works, began the hunt. At the time, Venezuela was going through a rough patch. Hugo Chávez was in prison after an unsuccessful coup d’état, and the collapse of Banco Latino had created a banking crisis. Finding a lost piece of art wasn’t a priority, but Soto and his friends eventually found it in a government storage space. The problem now was where to put it. In the end, it was the First Lady of Venezuela at the time, Alicia Pietri, who found a place for the sculpture. Pietri, a dedicated patron of the arts, childcare, and urban improvement, had found a spot along the Francisco Fajardo Highway, not far from La Casona (the official presidential residence) and a nearby airbase. And so the Esfera Caracas finally had a home. It was inaugurated in 1997 and soon became a cultural icon of Caracas. Like other works by Soto, the Esfera Caracas is a dynamic piece whose appearance differs depending on the viewer, as well as the elements. The sculpture is made from 1,800 three-quarter-inch hollow aluminum rods, suspended from a 39-foot-tall metal gantry on a concrete base. The suspended orange-colored rods create what appears to be a sphere suspended in the air, which seems to move or shimmer with changes in the light and the wind. For eight years, the Esfera Caracas stood along the highway, a famous landmark for people driving by. But in 2005, vandals began to destroy the piece. The lack of lighting at night, the absence of any watchmen or caretakers, and the ease of access to the sculpture made it an easy target, and soon the vandals had stripped away most of the aluminum rods. The frame stood all but bare, a sorry sight indeed. Soto had died earlier that same year, but the Soto Foundation, along with the cultural association PDVSA La Estancia, was determined to save the Esfera Caracas. Since much of the sculpture had been stolen, however, the only option was to go the Ship of Theseus route and rebuild the sculpture rod by rod. And while they were at it, the restoration team added new security features, a modern lighting system, and a new garden. Soto’s sphere had been reborn. In 2014, another problem arose. The widening of the Francisco Fajardo Highway and the construction of the new La Carlota Bridge meant that the Esfera Caracas had to be moved. So the whole thing was disassembled and reassembled 1,500 yards further along the highway, to a slightly higher location that offered better views of the sphere. And that’s where the Esfera Caracas stands today, its orange sphere shimmering by day and by night, one of the most iconic sculptures in Caracas and arguably the most famous work by the late Jesús Soto.  The Esfera Caracas is located along the Francisco Fajardo Highway, between Aeropuerto Francisco de Miranda and Generalísimo Francisco de Miranda Park. The sphere is actually in a space in the middle of the highway, so walking there isn’t ideal. You can, however, pull off the highway and park in the small parking lot near the sphere, after which you can explore and take photos at your leisure."

48,General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge,"Maracaibo, Venezuela","Once considered a marvel of engineering, there are now doubts about the structural integrity of this 5.4-mile cable-stayed bridge.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/general-rafael-urdaneta-bridge,"The General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge was considered a marvel of modern bridge design when it opened in 1962. A few years prior, the government of Venezuela held a competition calling for designs for a bridge across the Tablazo Strait of Lake Maracaibo. Twelve entries were submitted, but in the end it was the design of the innovative Italian civil engineer Riccardo Morandi that won the contract. Morandi was known for his use of reinforced and prestressed concrete, and his proposal was the only concrete design of the 12 entries. It was also the first of what would become his signature cable-stayed bridges. To the layperson, a cable-stayed bridge looks similar to a suspension bridge. But a cable-stayed bridge has cables (or stays) that run directly from the tower to the bridge deck, whereas a suspension bridge uses cables suspended vertically from a main cable to support the deck. To cross the Tablazo Strait, Morandi’s bridge would have to be exceptionally long. And, once completed, the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge had a total length of 5.4 miles, with five main spans supported from six 302-feet-tall towers, providing a clearance of 151 feet to the water below. That clearance, however, was not enough to prevent an oil tanker from crashing into the bridge just two years after its completion. On April 6, 1964, the supertanker Esso Maracaibo lost steering due to a major electrical failure, and minutes later crashed into the bridge. An 850-feet section of the bridge collapsed into the water along with four vehicles, killing seven people. It could have been an even greater tragedy had there been fires or explosions on the tanker. It was carrying 236,000 barrels of crude oil at the time, but no spill occurred. The bridge was repaired, with no damage done to the reputation of its designer, Morandi. It was still considered a marvelous design, and in 2001 the French structural engineer and bridge specialist Dr. Michel Virlogeux wrote that “the Lake Maracaibo Bridge [General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge] deserves to be part of the series of the most famous bridges over the world, with the Golden Gate Bridge, the bridge over the Firth of Forth, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Garabit Viaduct.” In recent years, however, concerns have been raised regarding the structural integrity of the aging bridge. One notable issue with the bridge is the weighing system, which according to some reports hasn’t worked for years, and as such is not calculating the weight of cargo vehicles—not a good situation for a bridge that carries around 40,000 vehicles a day. Then, on August 14, 2018, the Morandi Bridge in Genoa, Italy, collapsed, sending vehicles crashing to the ground 150 feet below and killing 43 people. The bridge had been designed by Riccardo Morandi, the same man behind the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge in Venezuela. And both were cable-stayed bridges made of prestressed concrete. Understandably, concerns surrounding Morandi’s Venezuelan bridge have since skyrocketed. The investigation into the collapse of the Morandi Bridge in Genoa is ongoing, and the bridge itself will be demolished rather than rebuilt. The future of the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge, meanwhile, remains very much in the balance, and its days may well be numbered. Plans are already underway for the construction of a second bridge across Lake Maracaibo.  The General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge crosses over the Tablazo Strait outlet of Lake Maracaibo in western Venezuela, connecting the city of Maracaibo with the major highways heading east to Barquisimeto and Caracas."
49,Monumento Manto de María,"Barquisimeto, Venezuela",This unique depiction of the Virgin Mary may be the tallest kinetic art sculpture in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monumento-manto-de-maria,"The Monumento Manto de María in Venezuela may be the tallest kinetic sculpture in the world, and also the tallest statue of the Virgin Mary. But like the work itself, it all depends on your point of view. In July 2014, a group of Venezuelan architects began work on the large monument in the city of Barquisimeto, some 160 miles west of Caracas. The artwork was to be a representation of the Divina Pastora (Divine Shepherdess), a religious icon of the Virgin Mary holding the infant Jesus, and the patron saint of the city. But rather than build a standard statue of stone or sheets of metal, the architects decided to utilize kinetic art, a sculptural style popular in Venezuela. Completed in 2016, the image of the Virgin Mary was created using 3,772 pieces of aluminum tubing, forming a total of 522 tubes that create the image itself. As you move around the monument—which is located on a 131-foot hill and is visible from miles away—the image falls in and out of focus, and can only be seen clearly from certain angles. The tubes that create the image are suspended from a massive concrete frame that surrounds the figure. The structure has a total height of 203 feet, while the image of the Virgin Mary reaches a height of 155 feet—and that’s enough to potentially put the Monumento Manto de María into the record books, twice. Not only does the monument have a claim to be the tallest kinetic art sculpture on the planet it might also be the world’s largest statue of the Virgin Mary. Singapore had previously laid claim to the world’s largest kinetic art sculpture, in the form of Kinetic Rain, an 810-square-foot sculpture found in Changi Airport. But the Monumento Manto de María dwarfs Kinetic Rain. As for being the world’s largest statue of the Virgin Mary, some might argue that the Monumento Manto de María isn’t really a statue in the traditional sense. But the people of Barquisimeto hardly care about that. For them, the monument is a source of great pride; one that can be seen from across the city and beyond.  The Monumento Manto de María is located on a hill just to the east of the city of Barquisimeto, which is the capital of the Lara state of Venezuela. Visitors can walk up the concrete towers at either side of the monument, scaling the 296 steps and stopping at four different mezzanines on the way up or down. From the top you’ll have impressive views across Barquisimeto and Cabudare just to the south. The monument is normally open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., but the hours have changed quite often since it was opened, so check before you go. Entrance is free."
50,Flor de Venezuela,"Barquisimeto, Venezuela",This iconic pavilion in Barquisimeto has a roof made from 16 “petals” that open and close depending on the weather.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/flor-de-venezuela,"When Venezuela went to the Expo 2000 World’s Fair in Hanover, it wanted to present the theme of “Venezuela! A Flower for the World.” Its pavilion, therefore, was designed to represent a flower with 16 huge petals that open and close. The Flor de Venezuela, also known as the Flor de Hanover, was designed by the acclaimed Venezuelan architect Fruto Vivas. Vivas took his inspiration from the tepuis, or table-top mountains, that rise up in the Gran Sabana, and more directly from the national flower of Venezuela, the orchid. The pavilion was designed and built for the Expo 2000, a World’s Fair held in Hanover, Germany, and its kinetic, naturalistic design certainly caught the attention of passersby. The roof of the glass building was made using 16 petals, each at least 33 feet (10 m) long, attached to a central mast in the glass-fronted building. A hydraulic system allows the petals of the artificial flower to open and close, a function that isn’t only aesthetic: when the weather turns, the flower can be closed to keep out the wind and rain. After the Expo 2000, the Flor de Venezuela was moved in stages to the city of Barquisimeto in the northwest of Venezuela, about 160 miles (260 km) west of Caracas. It took time, however, and the pavilion was finally inaugurated in its current location in 2008, under state ownership. The three exhibition levels of the 60-feet-high pavilion are accessed by a central spiral stairway (or elevator). Visitors walk up through the levels, where thousands of plants and numerous aquariums display the country’s biological diversity. There’s also a library and small amphitheater for shows and exhibitions. And at night, the whole building is illuminated, creating one of the most iconic landmarks in the city, and one officially recognized as part of the Cultural Patrimony of Venezuela.  The Flor de Venezuela is located at the intersection of Avenida Venezuela and Avenida Bracamonte, just to the east of downtown Barquisimeto. Entrance is free unless there’s a special event taking place. The pavilion is open Tuesday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m."
51,Embrace of Bolívar and Morillo,"Santa Ana, Venezuela",The monument marks where Simón Bolívar and his Spanish adversary Pablo Morillo met to have a drink together.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/embrace-of-bolivar-and-morillo,"This monument stands proudly within a small town in Venezuela. It honors an unlikely moment of peace between two political adversaries. On November 27, 1820, Simón Bolívar, who was at the time president of Gran Colombia, and Spanish general Pablo Morillo met to sign a temporary armistice. Until then, Bolívar had been operating under his Decree of War to the Death, which was a policy of no mercy toward Spaniards and Spanish loyalists in America. Morillo, the head Spanish forces in Venezuela, came to the table because of the effectiveness of Bolívar’s ferocious independence movement and because of the recent mutiny of officers back in Spain. The mutiny is an important background because it was a decisive move by liberals in the royal military that restored the fledgling Cadiz Constitution, which protected the rights of Spanish people under the monarchy. The armistice recognized Bolívar’s presidency and intended to set the country on a peaceful path to independence. The armistice did not last, even though Morillo would forfeit his command as a result of it, returning to Spain and defend the Cadiz Constitution. What’s especially notable about the meeting is how much both generals and their senior staff liked each other. Morillo wrote fondly of the meeting, saying that they planned to erect a monument and Bolívar, whose many talents included making friends in unlikely places, made reference to the many toasts that the group drank together. The monument that the men agreed to that evening was indeed erected, and stands to this day in the small town of Santa Ana."
