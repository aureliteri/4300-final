0,Dos du Dragon,"Ivoini, Comoros","This moss-covered, rocky outcropping looks like a mythical beast resting in the water.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dos-du-dragon-back,"On the northeast tip of the Grande Comore island, a rocky protrusion jutting out into the Indian Ocean, curling into the lapping waves. Locals have long referred to the natural feature as “Dos du Dragon,” or the dragon’s back. The ridge is dotted with free-standing stones that take on the appearance of a dragon’s nubby spine. Even the moss encasing the stones helps to sell the look, creating the appearance of a verdant set of scales. All three of Comoros’s islands, including Grande Comore where Dos du Dragon is located, formed millions of years ago due to volcanic activity. There are two volcanoes on Grande Comore—the larger Mount Karthala, which last erupted in 2006, and La Grille Volcano. Dos du Dragon likely formed during a past, unrecorded eruption. No one knows how or when the outcropping started being called the dragon’s back. Winged, serpent-like monsters are woven into the folklore of Comoros and other East African cultures. There’s the Swahili legend of the seven-headed snake Pembe Miuri, whose skin creates a fabulous silk-like cloth, and Tanzania’s bat-winged Popobawa, a demon who attacks those who don’t believe in it—even as recently as 1995. But the Western idea of a scaly, fire-breathing, winged dragon likely came with the arrival of French colonizers in the early 17th century. Whatever the origins of the name, it’s undeniable that the outcropping looks a lot like a sleeping dragon resting beneath the waves. Today, there’s a trail you can walk along the ridge’s spine, where you can make your own determination of what the ridge looks like."
1,Lac Salé,"Bangoua Kouni, Comoros","Legend says this remote, “bottomless” lake was created by a curse.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lac-sale-lac-niamawi-comoros,"Nestled next to the small village of Mitsamioli on the northern tip of Grand Comore, a turquoise saltwater lake sits in a crater just yards from the crystalline ocean. This small lake, known as Lac Salé or Lac Niamawi, likely formed as a result of volcanic activity from the nearby Mount Karthala in the 16th century. But local folklore has another origin story for the so-called “bottomless” lake. The story goes that a holy man or witch came to the village of Niamawi asking for water, but everyone refused them. In revenge, the witch cursed the town, dooming its inhabitants to the wrath of an erupting volcano. Once the lava and ash cleared, the lake had replaced the now-submerged town. A more recent story says that back in 1977 a group of Belgian divers hoping to explore the crater dived down into the lake never to resurface again. Throughout the day, the lake seems to change color, shifting from aquamarine to a deep green-blue. A layer of volcanic rock rests on the top edge of the crater. The lake continues to be a beautiful hike for visitors and locals alike, and there’s a short trail that winds around the crater and the nearby volcanic hill offering views of the vast ocean beyond.  Lac Salé is about an hour car ride away from the Comoros capital, Moroni, but be sure to leave a lot of extra time because the roads in Comoros are not always in the best shape."
2,Nyiragongo Volcano,Democratic Republic of the Congo,Mount Nyiragongo has erupted at least 34 times since 1882 & is home to the world's largest lava lake.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lava-lake-nyiragongo-volcano,"You’d think that the last place on Earth people would want to inhabit would be the bottom of a steep volcano hosting the world’s largest fluid lava lake. Despite the constant threat of catastrophic fiery death, the area at the foot of Mount Nyiragongo is dotted with highly populated bustling villages. One such disaster occurred in 1977, when the walls of the crater burst open and the lake of molten rock drained in less than an hour, pouring itself down into the villages at a terrifying speed of up to 60 mph. Unlike your average lava flow, the unique presence of an alkali-rich volcanic rock, melilite nephelinite, creates a highly fluid consistency, allowing it to move at speeds that can easily overcome anything in its path. The official death toll was 70, but many report much higher numbers, some estimating the losses at several thousand. The 1977 eruption took place when the lake was at its maximum depth ever recorded, 10,700 ft., but the extent of its volume varies depending on activity. No one knows how long the volcano has been active, but since 1882 it’s been very busy, erupting at least 34 times, occasionally bubbling and spewing fire for years before settling down. Located inside Virunga National Park about 20 km. North of Goma, Mount Nyiragongo is currently still active, its last deadly eruption taking 147 lives in 2002. Its activity is, for now, being confined to the crater, where the lake of lava is slowly rising once more."
3,Senkwekwe Mountain Gorilla Center,Democratic Republic of the Congo,The world's only facility where orphaned mountain gorillas are cared for.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/senkwekwe-mountain-gorilla-centre,"Established in 2009, the Senkwekwe Mountain Gorilla Center in Virunga National Park is the world’s only facility specifically created to care for orphaned mountain gorillas. While concerted conservation efforts over the last 30 years have brought the population of wild mountain gorillas from a dangerous low of 620 to just over 1,000 today, these beautiful creatures still face extreme threats in their natural habitat straddling the dangerous and unstable border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi. That’s where Virunga National Park’s Senkwekwe Mountain Gorilla Center comes in. As part of Africa’s oldest national park, the Senkwekwe Center was established in 2009 to care for orphaned mountain gorillas who were victims of wildlife poachers or animal trackers as infants. The Senkwekwe Center, which is named after a family of six mountain gorillas that were brutally murdered in 2007, is a unique sanctuary for these incredibly endangered species to live a full, protected life. The Center is managed by Virunga Park rangers and other dedicated staff, who are currently caring for four orphaned gorillas that were injured in snares or lost their family members. It has the rare distinction of being the only place in the world where mountain gorillas have been documented to thrive in captivity.  After a series of attacks and kidnappings that led to the deaths of at least 12 park rangers in 2018, Virunga National Park is currently closed to visitors and is not expected to reopen until at least 2019. If you plan on visiting when the park reopens, please contact an experienced and reputable tour company that can ensure your visit is conducted in as safe and reliable a way as possible."
4,Okapi Wildlife Reserve,"Ituri, Democratic Republic of the Congo","Home to pygmy hunter-gatherers, hundreds of animal and bird species, and the strange okapi, or forest giraffe.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/okapi-wildlife-reserve,"Located in the Congo River basin, the Okapi Wildlife Reserve is a refuge for nomadic pygmy Mbuti and Efe hunters and many species of animals and birds. It’s also home to about 5,000 of the estimated 30,000 okapi surviving in the wild. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve was established in 1992 and listed as a World Heritage Site in 1996. Covering about 5,300 square miles of the Ituri forest in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the reserve helps to protect rare plant and animal life, as well as the traditional lifestyle and culture of nomadic pygmy hunter-gatherers. The reserve takes its name from the okapi that live in its forests. These strange creatures are notable for the zebra-like markings on their legs, but are most closely related to giraffes, hence their other common names: forest giraffe, Congolese giraffe or zebra giraffe. Some 30,000 okapis survive in the wild today, of which about 5,000 live in the reserve. In total, the reserve is home to 101 mammal species and 376 documented species of birds. These include 17 species of primates (with a population of around 7,500 chimpanzees), an estimated 7,500 forest elephants, and populations of dwarf antelopes, water chevrotains, forest buffalo, bongos (nocturnal forest antelopes) and giant forest hogs. Along with the rangers who protect the park, the other guardians of these forests are the Mbuti and Efe hunters who roam the reserve. Both are pygmy peoples, with adult males typically reaching a height of at most 4 feet and 11 inches. They have lived in these forests for centuries, perhaps millennia, and continue to live as hunter-gatherers deep in the forest, maintaining their traditional lifestyles in harmony with their environment. Other humans, however, are far less respectful of the reserve and its many natural resources. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve faces numerous threats, including the commercial hunting of bushmeat, slash-and-burn forest clearance for agriculture, and illegal mining and logging, all exacerbated as immigrants continue to move into the Ituri forest from the overpopulated highlands to the east. As if that wasn’t problematic enough, armed militias are also a threat to the reserve, its rangers, and all that live within it. Like Virunga National Park in the DRC, Okapi has suffered attacks by Mai-Mai rebels. In June 2012, a group formed of elephant poachers and illegal miners attacked the Epulu Conservation and Research Center, killing six people and 13 of the 14 okapis that lived at the center. In July 2017, a large group of journalists and park rangers were attacked by a group also thought to have been Mai Mai rebels. The foreign journalists escaped with several rangers, but four local wardens and a tracker were killed. As with Virunga National Park, the situation remains tense and efforts are ongoing to maintain the relative stability of the reserve in the face of these man-made threats.  The Okapi Wildlife Reserve is located in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from the borders with South Sudan and Uganda. The nearest city to the reserve is Isiro, but tourists can arrange tours leaving from Beni or Kisangani, both of which require at least a full day journey, and longer in the wet season. But before you even consider a visit to the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, contact the Okapi Conservation Project for an update on the current security situation. On December 4, 2018, the Okapi Conservation Project told Atlas Obscura the following: “Technically, the Reserve is open for tourists, but we strongly encourage people not to travel to the area, especially with the pending presidential election on December 23. Security is unpredictable and they just closed the nearest airport in Bunia after stating security issues. After the election, we do not know what the situation will be. There is no fee to enter the Reserve for tourists at this time, but they would need to contact us to arrange a stay for a nominal fee, as we have the only place to stay in the town of Epulu, the Headquarters of the Reserve. Pending the results of the election, safety, and security, we hope to bring tourism back to the Reserve in the next few years.”"
5,Virunga National Park,Democratic Republic of the Congo,The most biologically diverse protected area in Africa is also the most dangerous.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/virunga-national-park,"Virunga National Park is the oldest and most biologically diverse protected area in Africa. Covering about 3,000 square miles, it’s a vital refuge for endangered gorillas and hundreds of other rare species. But it is also one of the world’s most dangerous conservation projects, as armed conflict has led to the death of more than 180 park rangers in the last 20 years. Created in 1925, Virunga National Park covers a vast area in the heart of the Albertine Rift Valley in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With its river valleys, volcanoes, lakes, and tropical forests, the park has an almost unrivaled diversity of ecosystems and landscapes. These habitats provide a home to many rare and endangered species, most famously the critically endangered mountain gorillas who live in Virunga’s volcanic forests, accounting for about one-third of the global population. More than 200 other mammal species live in the park, including okapis, lions, hippos, and forest and savanna elephants, alongside 706 species of birds, 109 recorded reptile species, 78 amphibian species, and 22 species of primates. Add humans into the mix, however, and things take a darker turn. Armed conflict has plagued the region for decades, and clashes with militia and smugglers have resulted in the deaths of more than 180 park rangers in Virunga over the last 20 years. Today, some 600 brave rangers risk their lives every day to protect the park, the gorillas, and all the other species that call Virunga home. And while they continue to do their job, the park itself has been closed to tourists since June 2018. The closure was enforced after rebels killed one park ranger and abducted two British tourists. The tourists were later released, but the park was closed until the end of the year. Whether Virunga will reopen in 2019 remains to be seen. The park is looking to introduce more robust security measures to help combat multiple security threats, including smuggling, illegal charcoal production, poaching, and the continued presence of the Mai Mai militia.  Virunga National Park is currently closed to visitors. The Virunga National Park Tourism official website has no details about the future reopening of the park, but does have a contact email for tourist inquiries. Prior to its closure, park permits ranged from $200 to $400."
6,Kahuzi-Biéga National Park,Democratic Republic of the Congo,One of the last refuges of the endangered eastern lowland gorilla.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kahuzibiega-national-park,"Covering 2,300 square miles, Kahuzi-Biéga National Park is one of the largest national parks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is also one of the last refuges of the eastern lowland gorilla, now considered critically endangered. Kahuzi-Biéga National Park was established in 1970 by Adrien Deschryver, a Belgian photographer and conservationist who ranks alongside Dian Fossey as one of the great protectors of the world’s endangered gorilla population. The vast park is named after the two dormant volcanoes located within its limits, Mount Kahuzi and Mount Biega. Both mountainous and lowland terrain are found within the park boundaries, covered with primary tropical forest that provides protection to a wide range of flora and fauna. These include around 136 species of mammals, 349 species of birds, and more than 1,170 plant species. Most famously, Kahuzi-Biéga is home to one of the largest and most studied populations of eastern lowland gorillas (known as Grauer’s gorilla or Gorilla beringei graueri) in the world. Tragically, the eastern lowland gorilla population has declined globally by 77 percent over the last 20 years, the result of logging, mining, civil unrest, and the poaching of the gorillas for meat. In 2016, the global population was estimated at fewer than 3,800. The situation in Kahuzi-Biéga has been even more drastic, with an 87 percent decline, exacerbated by the conflicts in Congo and Rwanda during the 1990s. Estimates in 2012 put the number of eastern lowland gorillas in the park at between 1,272 and 2,518 individuals in the lowland areas, and 170 in the highlands. There have, however, been some small signs of improvement in Kahuzi-Biéga. Researchers found that one gorilla population, in the highland sector of the park, has grown. In 2008, a status report put the group’s population at just 125. Thanks to the brave efforts of the park’s rangers, who risk their lives to protect the gorillas, the group has now increased in size to between 200 and 250.  Kahuzi-Biega National Park is located near the town of Bukavu in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. A decent road runs from Bukavu into the park, but you will first need to get permission to enter. This is done by requesting a letter of invitation from Kahuzi-Biega National Park. These formalities are very much necessary, both for the protection of the park and its inhabitants and for the safety of all visitors. As recently as March 2018, 27 people were abducted by Mai-Mai Raia Mutomboki militants inside the park. They were released a few weeks later. Despite this incident, the security situation remains relatively calm in Kahuzi-Biega, and tourists can enter once they have been cleared, briefed, and given the required permission to visit."
7,Gbadolite,"Gbadolite, Democratic Republic of the Congo","The ""Versailles of the Jungle"" built by a dictator is now a decaying shadow of its hubristic grandeur.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gbadolite,"Once a small village on the edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo that was barely even mentioned on most maps, Gbadolite was transformed into the extravagant seat of a dictator who changed the face of the country, but now the tiny town is a ruined complex of despotic extravagance gone to seed. When former journalist Mobutu Sese Seko took power in 1965 with the help of the CIA, he dug deep into the country’s coffers to turn his ancestral village into a glimmering jewel where he could live and entertain like a king unrivaled. Before Mobutu’s reign, Gbadolite was simply a small community of less than 2,000 people living in earthen huts, but the dictator constructed a trio of palaces nearby, a full-service airport, a hospital, a five-star hotel with over 100 rooms, and a land transportation infrastructure that could service the remote area. During Mobutu’s reign the lifestyle for the ruling powers in Gbadolite was lavish and extravagant with fine wines, rare cuisine, and full service entertainment facilities that catered to the dictator and his guests despite the poverty surrounding them and the corrupt source of the wealth. Mobutu’s rule ended in a coup in 1997 and during the ensuing war, much of the extravagant flourishes that the ruler had put in were damaged or destroyed and the shining seat of Mobutu’s power slid into ruin. Today Gbadolite is once again a remote village although some of Mobutu’s remaining supporters still tend to the remains of his crumbling palaces, conducting tours of the once gilded halls and making sure that the memory of the village’s time in the sun doesn’t completely fade."
8,Monument to African Dictator Laurent Kabila,"Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo",Built by a North Korean team this monument to African dictator Laurent Kabila has a suspiciously Kim Jong Il shaped body.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-to-african-dictator-laurent-kabila,"Towering in the middle of a traffic circle in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, is a roughly 25-foot tall statue of a bald headed, dour looking, Laurent Kabila, the former despotic leader of the DRCongo. With his finger raised to the sky, a small a book grasped in his left hand, and dressed in pleated military slacks and button up, the statue has a familiar air to it. The statue was built by a group of North Koreans artisans who work abroad as the Mansudae Overseas Project, and is among dozens of monuments the North Koreans have built throughout Africa. Ironically while North Korea’s economy and people suffer, masked by a massive government propaganda campaign, government propaganda itself has become one of North Koreas most successful exports. This is in part because the Mansudae Overseas Project provide monuments and museums for dictators and despots at bargain basement prices. But the cheap prices also come with cut corners. In this case of the Laurent Kabila statue, built by his son and current ruler of the DRC, the familiarity of Kabila to North Korean monuments may be further than stylistic. According to locals, the body on the Kabila statue belongs not to Kabila himself but to Kim Jong Il. The only modification was welding a bald and grumpy Kabila head on top. While there is no definitive proof of this - in part because there are currently only a few public statues of Kim Jong Il - it wouldn’t be the first time the Mansudae Overseas Project had been called out by one of their despotic clients for taking the easy route. The group, having been trained to specifically to produce state approved images of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong Il has had trouble creating realistic looking African faces, a problem that arose in both Mali and Senegal. The first version of Senegal’s massive African Renaissance Monument had to have their heads redesigned. “It had to have African heads, not Asian!”said Mr. Wade the 83 year old former Senegalese president who commissioned the massive statue. Despite the difficulties, the North Korean Mansudae Overseas Project is still the go to source for giant monuments of African dictators, and despite the Asiatic faces and suspiciously Kim Jong Il shaped bodies, they will likely continue to produce massive statues of corrupt leaders across the continent."
9,Tour de l'Échangeur,"Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo","Also known as the Limete Tower, la Tour de l'Échangeur can be seen from almost everywhere in Kinshasa.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tour-de-lechangeur,"Driving into Kinshasa from the N’dijili International Airport on Route National 1, one is confronted by a large tower in the Commune of Limite that is a bit awe-inspiring (given its location) and both surprising and perplexing. Known as the Tour de l’Échangeur (Interchange Tower), it remains today one of the tallest human-built structures on the African continent.A total of 689 feet (210 meters) tall, the tower was ordered built by President Mobutu Sese Seku in 1971 as a monument to Patrice Lumumba, a Congolese leader who fought for independence and who later served as the first prime minister of the country after independence in 1960 until his assassination in January 1961. The tower stands in the middle of a public square which was called Exchange Square until 2011, when its name was changed to Reconstruction Square. Today it hosts the Museum of Contemporary and Multimedia Arts which has collections of Congolese art and sculpture. A statue of Patrice Lumumba was erected in the square in January 2002."
10,Lac Assal,"Tadjourah, Djibouti","Rimmed by white crusts of salt on every edge, Lac Assal is one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lac-assal,"Lac Assal is the third saltiest body of water on the planet, saltier even than the Dead Sea. The lake lies at the bottom of a crater at the lowest point in Africa. Surrounding the lake are several dormant volcanoes and lava fields. The location has been used by locals for decades to harvest salt; hauling the goods away on camelback. While the surrounding desert and volcanos are beautiful, the turquoise blue lake contrasted against the brilliantly white salt fields is breathtaking. Every bit of ground and rock in and around the lake is coated in a thick layer of salt. Local vendors often sell salt crystals, salt incrusted rocks, skulls, and other trinkets from Lac Assal.  There aren't any facilities in the area so if you are planning on going for a dip, you'll want a way to wash the salt off. Lake Goubet or the hot springs that feed Lac Assal are both nearby options."
11,Lake Abbe,Djibouti,A salt lake dotted with steaming limestone chimneys.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-abhe,"Situated in the middle of the hot and hellish Afar Depression, Lake Abbe stretches six miles in width and is covered in clusters of massive, steam-blasting limestone chimneys. Although Lake Abbe is the ultimate destination for Ethiopia’s Awash River, its dry landscape absorbs the water, and the area is a vast landscape of salt flats. Besides Mount Dama Ali, a small dormant volcano, the landscape is almost completely level, and the steaming, sulphuric vents lend the region an apocalyptic, and Tatooine-like look. Some of the vents stretch as high as 150 feet into the air, and make the lake visible from miles around. Despite the hellish climate near Lake Abbe, nomadic Afar shepherds live in the area, along with a surprising population of flamingos."
12,The Lost City of Heracleion,"Alexandria, Egypt",An ancient city exhumed from the depths of the ocean.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-lost-city-of-heracleion-al-maadeyah-egypt,"It was barely more than a legend. Appearing in a few rare inscriptions and ancient texts, the city of Thonis-Heracleion was hidden away for thousands of years, submerged deep under the sea. After searching for years by screening the vast area of the Abu Qir Bay off the coast of Egypt, French archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team saw a colossal face emerge from the watery shadows. Goddio had finally encountered Thonis-Heracleion, completely submerged 6.5 kilometres off Alexandria’s coast. Among the underwater ruins were 64 ships, 700 anchors, a treasure trove of gold coins, statues standing at 16 feet, and most notably the remains of a massive temple to the god Amun-Gereb, and the tiny sarcophagi for the animals that were brought there as offerings. The ruins and artifacts made from granite and diorite are remarkably preserved, and give a glimpse into what was, 2300 years ago, one of the great port cities of the world. The harbor of Thonis-Heracleion (the Egyptian and Greek names of the city) controlled all the trade into Egypt. Built around its grand temple, the city was criss-crossed with a network of canals, a kind of ancient Egyptian Venice, and its islands were home to small sanctuaries and homes. Once a grand city, today its history is largely obscured and no one is quite sure how it ended up entirely underwater. To learn more visit: www.franckgoddio.org"
13,Nilometer,"Cairo, Egypt",An ancient instrument used to measure the waters of the Nile so Egyptian farmers would know whether to expect famine or flood.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nilometer,"In ancient Egypt, the behavior of the Nile could mean life or death each harvest season. So, long before the Aswan Dam was constructed to manage the flooding of the great river, Egyptians invented an instrument to measure the waters in order to predict the Nile’s behavior: the nilometer. There were three kinds of nilometers, and examples of all three can still be seen around Egypt. The simplest was a tall column housed in a submerged stone structure called a stilling well. One of these nilometers can be seen on Rhoda (or Rawda) Island in Cairo, an octagonal marble column held in place by a wooden beam at the top that spans the width of the well. The stilling well included a staircase so that priests, who were in charge of monitoring the nilometers, could walk down and examine the column. Nilometers were used for measuring water levels as early as 5,000 years ago. The nilometer on Rhoda Island dates back to 861, when it was built where an older nilometer had been, based on a design by Afraganus, a famous astronomer. The massive measuring stick had markings on it to indicate where the water level was at any given time, information the priests would use to determine what conditions the future held: drought, which would mean famine; desirable, which would mean just enough overflow to leave good soil for farming; or flood, which could be catastrophic. Only priests and rulers, whether pharaohs or later, Roman or Arab leaders, were allowed to monitor the nilometers, and their ability to predict the behavior of the Nile was used to impress the common people. (And to determine how much money would be collected in taxes.) This is why so many nilometers were built in temples, where only priests would be able to access the mysterious instrument. The nilometer on Rhoda Island is today housed in a modernized building. The conical roof replaced an older dome that was destroyed in 1825 during the French occupation. The interior is ornately carved, and three tunnels that once let water into the stilling well at different levels have been filled in, so visitors can walk all the way down. Another type of nilometer, like the one that can be seen on Elephantine Island in Aswan, had evenly spaced steps that lead straight down to the Nile, and indicator markings on the walls at different levels for each step. This one was often the first to indicate what conditions to expect, being located near Egypt’s southern border. The third kind, an example of which can be seen at Temple of Kom Ombo, a little further north, brought the water away from the Nile by way of a canal that deposited it into a cistern. And again, the indicating markers were carved into the wall, accessible by staircases for the priests and rulers who predicted the fate of the Egyptian crop."
14,The Temple of Abu Simbel,"Nubia, Egypt",Ozymandias’ time-keeping temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-temple-of-abu-simbel-egypt-nubia-egypt,"The Great Temple of Abu Simbel was completed in 1244 BCE. It is one of the crowning monuments of Rameses the Great, the pharaoh who would become the model for Percy Shelley’s poem “Ozymandias”: “My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: / Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” At Abu Simbel, four colossal statues of Rameses, each 20 meters high, look down upon the desert. But the temple’s greatest secret lies at its heart. It was built along the axis of the sun, so that twice a year, light would flood into its innermost sanctum. The temple was moved wholesale in the 1960s to accommodate the Aswan High Dam, but its uncanny architecture still functions today. On February 22 and October 22 each year, you may still see the sunlight reach the innermost room of Rameses’ time-keeping temple, as it did over three thousand years ago. There, the sun illuminates three of the four statues waiting there: Ra, Amun, and Rameses himself. Only the fourth statue, of Ptah, the mysterious creator-god, is left in shadow. UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention was created, in fact, to preserve Abu Simbel. After the Nasser Dam was built, the temple was briefly submerged underwater. A large effort saw it carried out and rebuilt, piece by piece, the large mountain it was carved into included."
15,City of the Dead,"El-Saf, Egypt",An endless sea of white conical domes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/city-of-the-dead,"Just outside the central Egyptian city of Minya lies the cemetery Zawiyyet al-Mayyiteen. Dubbed the “City of the Dead,” it is considered one of the world’s largest cemeteries. It is a truly huge necropolis, but more significant than its size is its thought-provoking beauty. Comprised of innumerable white conical domes, that stretch out across a wide plain, the necropolis appears similar to waves in the sea. Each of the several hundred mud-brick mausolea of the necropolis is topped with a dome. The cemetery stretches for several kilometers and was used by Muslims and Coptic Christians alike. A couple of rock-cut tombs from the Old Kingdom are found at the edge of the site, as well as a small step pyramid from the early 3rd dynasty. The pyramid is remarkable because it is the only pyramid built on the eastern bank of the Nile. The necropolis is particularly stunning at sunrise and sunset. However, visitors should be aware that this is a working cemetery and should be respectful and modestly dressed. 7 km southeast of Minya; Minya Governorate; Egypt"
16,Hathor Temple,"Dandarah, Egypt",One of the most well-preserved temples of ancient Egypt.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hathor-temple,"If you’ve heard about the Dendera Light Bulb and want to see the famed relief up close and personal, you will have to visit the underground crypt of Hathor Temple at the Dendera Temple Complex in Qena, Egypt. If you’re looking for a jaw-dropping experience, the beautifully intricate, 2,000-year-old temple is not to be missed. The Temple of Hathor is one of the most well-preserved temples in all of Egypt. There are three temples to view in the complex: the birthing temple at the front, the temple of Isis behind the main temple, and the main temple dedicated to Hathor. There is also a sacred pool that you can still explore. It’s empty though; sorry, no swimming. The colors seen throughout the temples are original, and amazingly vibrant considering the inside was once covered in soot from Bedouins and other desert peoples seeking asylum. They would use the temples as shelter, lighting fires for cooking and warmth. Since the temple complex used to be covered halfway in desert sand, it was easy for the soot to accumulate at the top. To show the amount of soot that had to be cleaned, archaeologists chose strips of ceiling in each temple to leave covered in soot as a comparison. The clearing of soot and all the sand burying the temples was tedious work that took years to complete. The temple complex displays influences from Egyptian, Greek, and Roman rulers. There was also a Coptic Christian church on the premises near the birthing temple at one point. The main temple was built by Ptolemy XII and nearly completed by Queen Cleopatra VII, around 54 to 20 BCE. There is evidence of temples and other structures that date back all the way to 2500 BCE. Hathor is the Egyptian sky goddess of sexual love, fertility, music, and dancing. It is also said she is the goddess of birth and motherhood. She is often depicted as the counterpart of Horus. In fact, Hathor translates to “House of Horus.” Inside the underground crypt, on the same relief wall as the famed Dendera light bulb (just to the right of it) is the most detailed depiction of Horus discovered to date. Getting to the crypt requires you to crawl on your hands and knees for a stint. Well, maybe not crawl, but entrance requires going down a steep staircase, turning around, getting on your knees and backing through so you don’t hit your head. If you are short, it helps. The temple is a wondrous marvel to explore. Each of the rooms is as intricately decorated as the Great Vestibule, the front room at the main entrance fronted by 24 columns. The ceiling in the Great Vestibule is a tribute to Nut (Newt), Goddess of the Sky. Beyond are antechambers with crypts, chapel rooms, and a sanctuary. There is a corridor on each side of the second antechamber. The corridor to climb to the top of the temple is a spiral, just as a bird would ascend, while the corridor to leave the roof is a straight path down, just as a bird would dive. This is a tribute to Horus. At the top of the structure, there is a small temple that was used for rituals to greet the rising sun, as well as another antechamber, called the Chapel of Osiris. Inside this chapel, one of the rooms holds a unique ceiling relief, called the Dendera Zodiac. It is considered the only complete “map” of the ancient Egyptian sky. The one at Hathor Temple is a replica, however. The real Dendera Zodiac is on display at the Louvre in Paris, France. The birthing temple is also intricately decorated, and reliefs on the side depict the births of gods and Egyptian pharaohs. It is positioned at the front of the complex, across from a display of former statues and partial column pieces found during excavation. The Temple of the Goddess Isis is situated behind the main temple near the sacred pool. It is small and not as decorative, but still worth a look. Some things to know if planning a visit to the Dendera (also spelled Denderah) temple complex: A professional tour guide is required to visit, since they can get the special permits needed to enter. Private tours will allow for longer viewing periods than a tour with a large group. Photography is permitted, but flashes are not."
17,White Desert,"Al Farafrah, Egypt",An alien landscape of chalk-rock in the Egyptian desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/white-desert,"Just a few hours from the bursting metropolis of Cairo lies a desert that will make you feel like you’ve landed on the surface of the moon. Formed by centuries of erosion and sandstorms, these unique calcium rock formations crop up across the landscape like great abstract statues. Some that resemble food have been given names like “mushroom” and “ice-cream cone,” while others have inspired more grandiose designations, such as “the Monolith” and “Inselberg.” Arguably the most characteristic of these peculiar natural formations is the famed “chicken and tree” set, also called “chicken and mushroom,” or, better yet, “chicken and atomic bomb.” Only in The White Desert will you encounter such a bizarre and awe-inspiring natural museum of chalk-rock. Many people opt to spend a night camping in the desert with Bedouin guides, where they can observe the changing faces of chickens and mushrooms and monoliths as the bright sun of the afternoon sinks into a shadowy dusk. As the sun goes down, the calcium sea seems to reflect all the fuchsias and oranges of the sky. And while any night under the stars of the Western Desert is an experience not soon forgotten, the lucky few that catch a full moon will witness the desert giving off a ghostly, iridescent glow."
18,The Tomb of Nefertari,"Luxor, Egypt","Known as the Sistine Chapel of Egypt, this tomb houses some of the most well-preserved paintings in Egypt.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tomb-of-nefertari-valley-of-the-queens-tomb-66,"The vast array of paintings inside the tomb of Nefertari, the first of the Great Royal Wives of Ramesses the Great, look as if they were painted just days ago. The vivid colors give visitors a clear idea of what some of the tombs and temples in the area looked like during antiquity. The tomb shows off a different level of detail compared to the other tombs found in Valley of the Kings or even the rest of the Valley of the Queens.  The cost to enter can be pricey and the additional ticket is not cheap, however, it's all well worth it. Time in the tomb is limited to about 10 minutes, but the guards are not too strict about this policy."
19,Colossi of Memnon,"Luxor, Egypt","These Egyptian statues have survived for 3,400 years and were an acoustic wonder of the ancient world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/colossi-of-memnon,"Since 1350 B.C., these ancient Egyptian statues have loomed over the Theban Necropolis. Though battered by more than 3,400 years of scorching desert sun and sporadic Nile floods, they’ve captivated the imaginations of curious travelers for millennia. The twin colossi (which no longer resemble twins) depict the Pharaoh Amenhotep III, who ruled during the 18th Dynasty. They once flanked the entrance to his lost mortuary temple, which at its height was the most lavish temple in all of Egypt. Their faded side panels depict Hapy, god of the nearby Nile. Though centuries of floods reduced the temple to no more than looted ruins, these statues have withstood any disaster nature throws their way. In 27 B.C., an earthquake shattered the northern colossus, collapsing its top and cracking its lower half. But strangely, the damaged statue did more than merely survive the catastrophe: After the earthquake, it also found its voice. At dawn, when the first ray of desert sun spilled over the baked horizon, the shattered statue would sing. Its tune was more powerful than pleasant; a fleeting, otherworldly song that evoked mysterious thoughts of the divine. By 20 BC, esteemed tourists from around the Greco-Roman world were trekking across the desert to witness the sunrise acoustic spectacle. Scholars including the likes of Pausanias, Publius, and Strabo recounted tales of the statue’s strange sound ringing through the morning air. Some say it resembled striking brass, while others compared it to the snap of a breaking lyre string. The unearthly song is how these ancient Egyptian statues wound up with a name borrowed from ancient Greece. According to Greek mythology, Memnon, a mortal son of Eos, the goddess of Dawn, was slain by Achilles. Supposedly, the eerie wail echoing from the cracked colossus’ chasm was him crying to his mother each morning. (Modern scientists believe early morning heat caused dew trapped within the statue’s crack to evaporate, creating a series of vibrations that echoed through the thin desert air.) Sadly, well-intentioned Romans silenced the song in the third century. After visiting the storied statues and failing to hear their ephemeral sounds, Emperor Septimius Severus, reportedly attempting to gain favor with the oracular monument, had the fractured statue repaired. His reconstructions, in addition to disfiguring the statue so the fixtures no longer looked like identical twins, robbed the colossus of its famous voice and rendered its song a lost acoustic wonder of the ancient world.  For the past couple of decades, a full excavation of the temple site has been undertaken, and still continues — note the white fence in the distance beyond the colossi, which serves to keep visitors from accidentally falling into excavation trenches. The Colossi are also free to visit."
20,End of the World Cinema,"Qesm Sharm Ash Sheikh, Egypt",An abandoned outdoor movie theater in the Sinai desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/end-of-the-world-cinema,"As you walk on the sand to get to the eeriest theater in the world, the scene feels distinctly post-apocalyptic. This deserted outdoor cinema has yet to see its premiere; its 700 weathered and worn theater seats languish amid the howl of the desert wind. At the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, the abandoned movie theater, dubbed the “End of the World Cinema,” is a silent and bizarre view. It was built by Frenchman Diynn Eadel in the late 1990s, but suffered a power cut on what was supposed to be its premiere night. No one knows what went wrong, but some say the local authorities weren’t thrilled by the prospect of a movie theater in the middle of the desert and were the ones responsible for the generator’s malfunction. At the time, Eadel told a visiting photojournalist that Jurassic Park would be the first movie to play at his Seventh Art Theater. According to the cinema’s introductory flyer, it was meant “to prove that tourism is not necessarily a destructive element and that the Great Theater of Nature can reconcile us with the elements.” However, Eadel’s dream of a theater in the middle of the desert of Egypt remains unrealized, with no further plans of reviving the Sinai cinema. Today, the only audience rides motorbikes through the desert to see the rows of abandoned seats, with their aura of possibility and decay, backdropped by the Sinai hills painted on a screen of a sky full of stars. Update: The cinema was looted and badly damaged. Update April 2018: The area has been closed to tourists by the Egyptian Government."
21,Desert Breath,"Qesm Hurghada, Egypt",A massive work of modern art that appears to be a crop circle in the middle of the desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/desert-breath,"Rising out of a flat expanse in the Egyptian desert, the earthen cones of Desert Breath seem like giant, alien ant hills, but they are simply art. Completed in 1997 after a number of years under construction, the installation consists of a fractal spiral of conical protrusions and alternately conical depressions. From the ground, the full scope of the project is hard to see, as the site appears to be a string of increasingly large sand piles, with the matching pits from which they were dug lurking nearby. However, when seen from the air, the full effect of the piece becomes clear as the 89 cones and 89 matching depressions spiral out from one another in two geometrically precise arms that increase in diameter the farther they get from the central axis. At the center where the two strings meet, a cone rises up out of a large central pit which was originally filled with water. Despite being otherwise unadorned, the mathematical precision on display at the site creates a sense of wonder. Desert Breath was purpose-built to slowly erode back into the swept sands it was created from and in the decade and a half since its construction, it has begun to do just that. The piece may not be as large as it was when it was installed, but this work of art is still worth a visit for anyone wishing to see an Egyptian monument that isn’t quite so ancient."
22,Monastery of Saint Simon,"Cairo, Egypt",The massive cave church of Cairo's Zabbaleen community is one of the largest Christian churches in the Middle East.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monastery-of-saint-simon,"Large Christian communities are not abundant in Muslim-dominated Egypt. One of the more populous groups is the garbage scavenging Zabbaleen, who have retained their Coptic beliefs and established the largest Christian church in the Middle East at the Monastery of Saint Simon. The Zabbaleen (meaning literally “garbage collectors”) village at the base of the Mokattam cliffs began around 1969 when the Cairo governor decided to move all of the garbage collectors to a single settlement. The garbage collectors were largely Coptic Christians and as their numbers continued to grow over the years the need for a centralized church began to grow. In 1975, the first Christian church was built in the village but after a large fire broke out nearby, work began on a monastery that was built right into the cliffside. The Monastery of Saint Simon was the result of this new project. Simon the Tanner was a craftsman saint who lived during the 10th century and the cave church that was dedicated to him seems as though it might last for 10 more. Using a pre-existing cave and the slope that led into it, the current monastery seats 2,000 people around a central pulpit. Other nearby caves have also been built into separate church spaces and all of them have been linked to create a massive Christian complex in the heart of garbage city. Since tourism through the scavenger’s village is not a thriving industry, reaching the Monastery of Saint Simon is no small feat, yet as the largest Christian church within a handful of countries, hundreds of thousands of people make the pilgrimage each year.  There are 3 churches to check out at this spot. Uber is the way to go - keep Google Maps handy and ask the locals as the directions from Uber can be unreliable."
23,Pyramid of Djoser,"Al Badrashin, Egypt",This ancient structure is widely thought to be the oldest intact pyramid in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pyramid-of-djoser,"Built as a tomb for the pharaoh Djoser (or Zoser), the Djoser Pyramid was constructed between 2630 BC and 2611 BC in Saqqara, Egypt. Although it is considered the world’s oldest intact large-scale stone monument, the ancient structure is often overshadowed by Egypt’s most famous pyramids. The Djoser Pyramid stands 197 feet high and was built using 11.6 million cubic feet of stone and clay. Imhotep—a doctor, priest, and sculptor, among other titles and talents—is widely attributed as the pyramid’s architect. Initially, the structure was designed as a traditional, flat-roofed tomb called a mastaba, but Djoser wanted something bigger, something grander. So tradition was put aside for innovation, and in the span of Djoser’s 19-year rule the pyramid expanded to its current six layers, with a height that made it the largest building of its time. The step pyramid’s unique structure was also an important architectural advancement: The famous pyramids of Giza, for example, are the result of techniques seen practiced here. The pyramid was part of a larger 40-acre complex containing a courtyard, temples, and chapels, all enclosed inside a 30-foot wall. The entrance to the complex, as well as 13 fake doors, is built into the wall. The complex also includes a number of building facades, all of which served ritual purposes. The pharaoh’s burial chambers are located deep within the pyramid, along with those of his 11 daughters. The burial chamber is part of the pyramid’s winding, maze-like series of tunnels, which researchers think may have been designed to prevent theft (although the pyramid was eventually looted). Sadly, these protective tunnels may actually be part of the reason for the pyramid’s deterioration. Without conservation, experts fear that the 3.5 miles (5.5 kilometers) of tunnels could collapse, taking the historic monument with it. Efforts to conserve the building have been controversial, as a company tasked with the restoration has been accused of doing the opposite: it was claimed that the restoration work was actually further damaging the pyramid. Google reviews in 2023 indicate that once again tourists can ener the Pyramid of Djoser. Visitors are also welcome to stand in awe in front of this architectural feat and see what has been called “a revolutionary conception that would influence the entire history of Egyptian architecture.”"
24,Al-Andalus Garden,"Cairo, Egypt",A preserved oasis with traditional Andalusian-style architecture and beautiful views of the Nile.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alandalus-garden-park,"Visitors to Cairo likely pass this unique garden park on the bank of the Nile dozens of times when traveling to reach the Gezira Sporting Club, the Cairo Tower, or downtown Zamalek. But the park is hidden behind high walls, keeping it a peaceful oasis within the crowded city. Built by Zulfugar Pasha in 1929 as a gift for his wife, this botanical-style garden on Gezira Island in the neighborhood of Zamalek is special among the parks in Cairo. The architect originally designed the landscape to be part of the royal mansion of Khedive Ismail, and its former grandeur can still be felt today. The most unique aspect of the park are the preserved old structures designed in the traditional Andalusian architectural style, based on designs from Moorish Spain. The lush greenery is studded with colorful mosaic benches and steps surrounding a large fountain. There are many interesting statues, depicting Pharaohs, lions, and the famous Egyptian poet Ahmed Shawky, the “Prince of Poets,” who was known for his love poems. Beautiful panoramic views of the Nile, and the city across, add to the already romantic atmosphere of the landscape. It’s a wonderful respite from the busy streets of Cairo, harkening back to a former era of the city.  The park is hidden behind high walls but the easiest way to spot it is that it's across from the Sofitel Hotel & Cairo Tower street entrance."
25,Cairo's City of the Dead,"Cairo, Egypt","In Egypt's expanding metro area, many of the neighbors are dead.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/city-of-the-dead-cairo-egypt,"Just outside of Cairo, this City of the Dead used to house only corpses dating back to the 7th century. Created as an Arabic cemetery during the conquest of Egypt, the necropolis has developed into one of Egypt’s worst slums where the dead and living coexist in morbid neighborliness. 20 million people live in Cairo’s metro area, making it one of the largest cities in the entire world. It also has a massive population living in abject poverty, which has forced many people into the City of the Dead. Stretching for four miles on the outskirts of Cairo, the row housing for the deceased has evolved into a deathly slum. As people moved out of agricultural centers, or were displaced by natural disasters, they took up residences in old mausoleums, and around the tombs of the necropolis. In total, 500,000 people occupy the necropolis, filling the gaps around the final resting places of 7th century Egyptians. Although there are plans to relocate people out of the living cemetery, the population has grown so large that there is almost nowhere to move residents. Like so many other slums across the world, the City of the Dead is greatly populated by children, who must face fears and live in and around tombs, and make do with their morbid surroundings."
26,Wadi al-Hitan (Valley of the Whales),"Ibsheway, Egypt",Egyptian treasure trove of fossils documenting the whale's transition from land mammal to sea creature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wadi-al-hitan,"Few sites in the world speak of an evolutionary tale as rich and captivating as that of Wadi al-Hitan, Egypt’s “Whale Valley.” There, amid a wind-sculpted landscape of sand and rocks, lies a large collection of the most unexpected of animal remains—whale fossils. To be exact, the scattered bones belong to a long-extinct suborder of whales known as archaeoceti. What really sets these ancient creatures apart from your ordinary, modern-day cetacean is one odd, yet profoundly important, anatomical difference—hind legs. This critical deviation in the fossil record of whales is the basis for the notion that the massive seafaring beasts we know today began their existence as land-based animals. But since their discovery in 1902, the fossils of Wadi al-Hitan have tended to raise more questions than they’ve answered. While the hundreds of archaeocete skeletons provide a rare and valuable snapshot of whales in the final stages of losing their hind limbs and transitioning to a marine existence, evolutionary biologists are still left puzzled over the identity of the whale’s earliest ancestor. Similarities in tooth shape led to the long-held belief that whales were related to mesonychids, carnivorous hoofed mammals that closely resembled wolves. It wasn’t until 2005 that a team of American and French scientists finally discovered the missing link between whales and their closest relative, the hippopotamus. This discovery, supported by another collection of cetacean fossils located in Pakistan, placed the whale in the different taxonomic group of artiodactyls, which includes such unexpected relatives as camels, pigs, and giraffes. Although the fossils at Wadi al-Hitan are certainly not the oldest in the world, their sheer number and remarkable preservation (even some stomach contents are still intact!) make them invaluable to paleontologists and evolutionary scientists. For this reason, Egypt’s “Whale Valley” was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005. The justification behind this honor is even more apparent when considering the diversity of fossils seen at Wadi al-Hitan. Aside from the impressive archaeocete fossils, the largest of which measures 21 meters in length, fossils of other early animals such as sharks, crocodiles, and turtles are also found at the site. Wadi al-Hitan may be hard to reach, typically receiving only 1,000 visitors each year, but for the few fortunate enough to get there, an astounding oasis documenting millions of years of coastal marine life awaits. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about Wadi al-Hitan.  Wadi Al-Hitan is 150 km southwest of Cairo."
27,Unfinished Obelisk,"Aswan, Egypt",The largest known Ancient Egyptian obelisk.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/unfinished-obelisk,"Around the Upper Egyptian city of Aswan are several ancient stone quarries, which were the source of Ancient Egypt’s finest granite. The Northern Quarries of Aswan holds the remains of the Unfinished Obelisk. Had it have ever been erected, this obelisk would have been the largest one of Ancient Egypt and would have reached a stunning height of 42 meters. The largest finished obelisk, the Lateran Obelisk is 10 meters shorter than the Unfinished Obelisk, and today stands in Rome, Italy. Although not the largest obelisk, it is nevertheless the largest known monolith of Ancient Egypt, and one of the largest in the world, with an estimated weight of 1,200 tons. The work on the Unfinished Obelisk had been abandoned due to clearly visible cracks that appeared in the granite. The huge structure, which is partly connected to the parent rock, has been left in situ. The obelisk, together with several worker’s marks and rock carvings, provides a rare insight into the working techniques of Ancient Egypt. Virtually nothing is known about which pharaoh ordered the Obelisk and where it was supposed to be erected."
28,Ureka,"San Antonio de Ureca, Equatorial Guinea",This village surrounded by breathtaking waterfalls is one of the wettest places on earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ureka,"From the moment you get out of your car and see that first waterfall tumbling down the cliff until you’re swimming beneath another waterfall deep within the jungle, you know you’re somewhere special. A two-hour drive to the south of Bioko Island, Ureka is a hidden world. Seeing that first waterfall you might wonder if you should bother to go any further. You could spend the day right there, like the locals do, on the beach, barbecuing and paddling in the waves. Or, you could take a walk. You’ll need to start early. Bring plenty of water and sun protection. It’s hot. The beach is completely exposed. But if you walk for about an hour along the deserted, black sand beach, you’ll find waterfall number two. Hidden in the jungle, it spills into a pool perfect for swimming and fishing. You might wonder again if you should go on. You could just spend your day here, wallowing in the cool water. Keep going. Deeper into the jungle. There is a path, but things grow fast here and it can be difficult to find. Thirty minutes of thrashing through the trees, scrambling up and over fallen logs, until you arrive at the sand of a tiny private beach. You’ll need to cross a river here. The tide can be high. The current strong. The water may reach up to your neck so you’ll need to carry your backpack over your head. Wear water shoes if you can—the stones on the riverbed are brutal. Continue upstream along the low rocky river you’ve just crossed. Suddenly, you’ve made it. Waterfall number three. A gushing, wide mouth, cascading into the river that you’ve just crossed. Taking a dip is recommended. Or hang out on the grass nearby, listen and watch. There is nobody else around. You might think this is it. You’ve already walked so far. What could possibly be more rewarding, more special than this? Don’t give up now. Back down the river. Along the sand and around the corner. During the dry season, you might encounter a group of students from Drexel University. They camp out in the jungle for months at a time, studying the giant turtles that nest on the beach. They’ll appreciate it if you bring them some treats. Living this remotely, they don’t get much opportunity to restock their supplies. Finally, hidden just beyond their camp, there it is: waterfall number four. Tumbling down from the cliff into a large beautiful pool. Like something out of a fantasy novel. Something truly from another world. And at the end of the day, damp and tired, you’ll make your way back through the jungle. Walking along the majestic black sand beach, as the afternoon waves crash onto the shore, you’ll marvel at how fortunate you are to be one of the few people in the world to experience such a magical place.  You will need to acquire a permit from the authorities in order to access Ureka. You may be asked to show your permit at the village nearby. It is recommended to use a local tourism operator to apply for the permit on your behalf. You will need to supply your passport details for the permit to be granted and pay a fee. If driving yourself, make sure you have a decent 4WD vehicle and the driver is competent and comfortable with steep roads. Although the road is asphalt all the way, the roads are very steep–many, many brake pads have been totally burnt out by this road, and there is no cell reception, so you want to avoid a situation where you might need to call for help! Bring a backpack with a hat, sunscreen, bug spray, food, and plenty of water. It’s a full day out and there’s nowhere to buy additional food. Check the tide times beforehand so you can plan your trip. The tides can get quite high, the currents are strong and you will likely need to cross rivers in chest-deep water."
29,Playa de Arena Blanca,"Luba, Equatorial Guinea","During the dry season, this white-sand beach hosts thousands of breeding butterflies.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/playa-de-arena-blanca,"Playa de Arena Blanca is a stunning white sand beach on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea. But that’s not the only reason to visit. During the dry season between December and February, thousands of butterflies populate the beach to breed. The spectacle is known to create dense “clouds” of butterflies. Bioko Island is the largest volcanic island in the Gulf of Guinea, located 100 miles northwest of Equatorial Guinea’s coast and 60 miles from the southern coast of Nigeria. In the native Bube language, the island is called Ëtulá Ëria. Much of its landscape is dominated by tropical rainforests and steep mountains. That landscape supports a diverse population of plants and animals. The island is home to more than 200 species of birds, and its beaches are a breeding ground for four species of sea turtles. Interestingly, a 1994 analysis found that Bioko has fewer endemic species (plants and animals found nowhere else) than the nearby islands of São Tomé and Príncipe. These other islands in the Gulf of Guinea have been isolated for much longer, while Bioko was connected to the African mainland until about 10,000 years ago. Bioko also has some of the greatest butterfly diversity in the world. In 2000, 172 different butterfly species were recorded on the 779-square-mile island, and researchers continue to learn more about the fluttering insects that call this island home. In 2015, researchers identified three new species on the island that sport some extraordinarily cool names: the striped policeman (Coeliades forestan), the silky dart (Semalea pulvina), and the forest sylph (Ceratrichia phocion camerona).  Playa de Arena Blanca is about an hour’s drive south of Equatorial Guinea's capital, Malabo."
30,Pico Basilé,"Malabo, Equatorial Guinea","It's been nearly a century since this volcano, the tallest mountain in Equatorial Guinea, erupted.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pico-basile,"Standing 3,011 meters (9,878 feet) tall, Pico Basilé is the volcano king of Bioko Island. The summit of the shield volcano, which last erupted in 1923, is often hidden by clouds. You might catch a glimpse of its peak, but the full extent of its grandeur will only appear on a clear, cloudless day. And clear, cloudless days don’t tend to happen that much around here. In the dry season, you’d be forgiven for forgetting that Pico Basilé is even there, lurking quietly behind a wall of dust. Late November to early March is when the annual phenomenon known as Harmattan occurs, in which sand from the Sahara Desert blows across the sea. It coats the island in dust so thick that visibility is reduced to not much more than 50 meters (160 feet). Your best bet for a full Pico viewing is after a rainstorm. As soon as the rain has washed away the clouds (or the dust), finally Pico will appear in all its glory, presiding majestically over Equatorial Guinea’s capital city of Malabo. Pico Basilé is the tallest mountain in Equatorial Guinea. It’s a volcano. And it’s there. So of course you want to stand on the top. After all, isn’t that what mountains are for? If you want to reach the top, you have three options: Driving up the paved road in the comfort of an air-conditioned vehicle (preferably one with four-wheel drive); Cycling up on your fancy road bike; Walking up (but probably not back down). The road is asphalt and surprisingly well-maintained, but it is, horrendously steep. Don’t be fooled by those 10 percent gradient road signs. If you’re driving, make sure your driver knows how to drive a stick and is comfortably staying in first gear—especially on the way back down. The fact that the road is well-maintained, and not heavily trafficked, can also make it an enticing challenge for keen cyclists. But again with the steepness. Even the most experienced hill-climbing cyclists will find they need to step off and walk in certain sections. If you choose to walk, remember that this road was made for vehicles, not hiking. You will be walking 30 kilometers, straight up. And there aren’t a lot of views along the way. And there is certainly no guarantee of a view at the top. (You might just find yourself surrounded by a chilly cloud.) Let’s be frank—it’s likely that you won’t see much more than a telecommunications tower and a couple of security guards at the top. But remember—it’s about the journey, not the destination! Right? Or you could just wait for a rainstorm and admire the view from sea level.  As with most tourist attractions in EG, you will need a permit. You need to apply, pay for it and receive a copy ahead of time. The road is about 30km up. If driving, make sure your driver is comfortable with being in first gear and can recognize the smell of burning brake pads. If you’re walking up, arrange a ride for the trip down. Walking 30km straight up asphalt takes about 6 hours and it hurts. It’s not worth walking back down. Take plenty of water and snacks. A support vehicle is a good idea if you can arrange it. Take a sweatshirt or jacket for the top. Don’t be deceived by the humidity down below. It’s chilly up there. The security guards at the peak may want to see your permit. They also appreciate token gifts like soft drinks, etc. Their shifts up there are long."
31,Catedral de Santa Isabel,"Malabo, Equatorial Guinea",The largest Christian church in the country is a complicated symbol of Spanish colonialism.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/catedral-de-santa-isabel,"On a quiet square nestled along a seaside harbor stands a towering cathedral with a peach-colored facade and two soaring, 130-foot-tall towers. Construction on Catedral de Santa Isabel began while Equatorial Guinea was still under Spanish colonial rule in 1887. The church was then consecrated in 1916. Local practitioners, businesses, and the Spanish government all came together to fund the massive building project. The Spanish architect Llairadó Luis Segarra was eventually commissioned to design the Gothic revival church and the famous Catalan architect Antonio Gaudí even weighed in on the church’s design. While many people associate Spanish colonialism with the Americas, Equatorial Guinea was Spain’s last colony to gain independence in 1968. Equatorial Guinea’s capital, Malabo, and the Catedral de Santa Isabel within it rest on Bioko island’s northern coast. But in the 15th century, Portuguese explorers completed a survey of the island and called it Fernando Po, after the expedition’s leader. For centuries, Indigenous Africans, especially the Bubis, expelled colonialists from the island with guerilla warfare and their knowledge of the island’s dense landscape. The southern part of the island even became a haven for people who had escaped from enslavement on nearby Portuguese-controlled islands like São Tomé and Príncipe. One Spanish traveler in the 1780s said these runaways created “a republic that is governed by its own laws.” It was only later in the 19th century that Spain began building up Bioko island with construction projects like the cathedral. At times, Spain forcibly shipped free people of color from Cuba to the island to bolster the population. Spain also systematically attacked the Bubis, targeting their religion and social systems as disease and Spanish attacks reduced their population from 30,000 in 1820 to 10,000 in 1911. Today there’s still a lot of Spanish influence in Equatorial Guinea. The country’s official language is Spanish and Spanish food and restaurants can be found throughout the country. Approximately 87 percent of Equatorial Guinea’s population is Catholic, one of the highest proportions per capita in any African nation. While many praise Catedral de Santa Isabel as a beautiful example of Spanish colonial architecture, it stands today as a complicated symbol of Spanish colonialism in the country."
32,Fiat Tagliero Service Station,"Asmara, Eritrea",Eritrea's futuristic gas station is a nod to Italy's fascist history.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fiat-tagliero-service-station-asmara-eritrea,"Located in the center of Asmara, Eritrea’s capital city, is the Fiat Tagliero Service Station. Designed by famed Italian architect Giuseppe Pettazzi, this Futurist-style gas station was completed in 1938. Asmara is the largest city in Eritrea and was incorporated as its capital by the Italians during their colonial rule of the African country. Pettazzi built many Art Deco buildings in Eritrea during this time, but this service station— modeled on airplane design as evidenced by its “wings”— is his most famous. The Fiat Tagliero Service Station is a petrol station that includes a central tower with office space, a cashier’s desk, and a shop. The building’s flighty design is widely understood as a problematic nod to Italy’s Fascist history; it was built just months after the country’s airplanes dispensed thousands of sulfur mustard shells over Eritrea, killing tens of thousands of innocent civilians. During construction, authorities attempted to convince the architect that the building’s wings required pillars, as a safety concern. Pettazzi refused to comply and went so far as to threaten the service station’s contractor and an unassuming construction worker with a handgun in a dramatic display of conviction standing atop his creation. Clearly, he felt the supports were not necessary, and he won the argument. Pettazzi’s act is unsurprising, as architects who were too avant-garde for Mussolini’s Fascist Italy (and Europe in general) were sent to Asmara to design wildly imaginative buildings as a way to illustrate Italy’s idea of a modern city in their newly-taken territory. Pettazzi fit the bill. A remarkable example of Italian modernist architecture, the Fiat Tagliero Service Station remains structurally sound to this day and has survived numerous conflicts and war. It was restored in 2003 and is unable to be altered by law. Thanks in part to this striking service station, Asmara was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2017.   The Fiat Tagliero Service Station is found between Mereb Stree and 172-1 Street near Sematat Avenue. You can walk the perimeter of the building and take photos, but entrance into the Fiat Tagliero Service Station is not permitted."
33,Eritrean Railway,"Asmara, Eritrea",Take a ride back in time with a steam locomotive trip through Eritrea’s mountainous countryside.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eritrean-railway,"The Eritrean railway once connected the seaside port city of Massawa to the inland city of Agordot, spanning about 190 miles in total. After falling into disrepair over decades of conflict, sections of the railway are running again with much of the original equipment. Constructed between 1887 and 1932 during Italian colonial occupation, the railroad was meant to extend to the Sudanese border, but construction plans were halted by the Italo-Ethiopian War. The years of the Italian war effort in World War II saw peak ridership of the railway, with hundreds of thousands of passengers and tons of freight traversing the lines. After Italy’s defeat in the war, however, some of Eritrea’s locomotives and cables were seized by the British for use in their nearby East African colony, Kenya. After Eritrea’s annexation by Ethiopia, the railway fell into disrepair and paused service in 1975, closing one year later. After 30 years of intense conflict, Eritrea achieved independence from Ethiopia in 1991, and gained statehood two years later. In 1994, Eritrea’s government began a project to restore parts of the railway, with the Asmara - Massawa line returning to service in 2003. While much of the railway’s ruination was from general neglect and decay, huge parts were destroyed during the struggle for independence. Carriages and locomotives rusted while stations along the line were raided. Although the Eritrean government took foreign bids for reconstruction, it ultimately decided to pursue reconstruction with its own resources. Today, riding the railway is almost exclusively a privilege afforded by private tours. The train only travels about 12 miles per hour, making it difficult for commercial use. The rolling stock equipment used for the ride is the same that was used more than a century ago. While the railway line between Asmara and Massawa is serviceable, it needs upgrades to return to full commercial operation, and many repairs are still needed in order to extend the functional range to all former stations. There are rumored discussions with Sudan, however, for investment in a transnational rail system that would fund a more complete restoration of the system.  Visitors have a few options of tour companies that will help arrange a ride between Asmara and Massawa, but for a steep price. Rates are quoted anywhere between $500 for a ride, to $250 an hour for a 10-hour journey."
34,Tank Graveyard,"Asmara, Eritrea",Wander among hulking piles of rusted machinery left over from the Eritrean-Ethiopian War.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-tank-graveyard,"The tank graveyard of Asmara is filled with rusted tanks, trucks, and other wrecked vehicles piled in twisty rows through which you can wander. Paths are littered with bits of ammunition and Russian metal plates with C.C.C.P. (the Russian acronym for the U.S.S.R.) stamped on them. But the tank graveyard is more than just an assemblage of destroyed military hardware. It’s a bleak reminder of one of Africa’s longest wars in recent memory—the Eritrean War of Independence, fought between 1961 and 1991, that secured Eritrea’s independence from Ethiopia. Ethiopia, then backed by the Soviet Union, had a large army including tanks, trucks, cars, and machinery currently visible at the tank graveyard. Eritrean soldiers, on the other hand, fought with what they could find. Sandals were composed of tires and captured weapons were the only means of defense. Despite the stark difference in armies, Eritrea’s determination to gain sovereignty allowed them to destroy a significant amount of Ethiopia’s war machinery. Ethiopia hid the evidence of their losses in a site just outside Asmara, knowing that leaving it on the streets would only bolster Eritrea’s morale. In 1991, when Eritrea finally won the war, Eritrean soldiers collected all the military hardware they could find and amassed it into what is now the tank graveyard. The site has turned into a public space that the few tourists who are able to enter Eritrea can visit. To local Eritreans, the site serves as a proud symbol of national liberation, and a reminder of the countless lives lost fighting during the war.  Visitors do need a permit, but it is free. You can get one at the ministry of tourism office. Asmara Grande Tours is also very helpful."
35,Medeber Market,"Asmara, Eritrea","Scrap material from around Eritrea finds a new life at this outdoor market, where upcycling is a lifestyle.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/medeber-market,"Piles of discarded metal, rubber, wood, and plastic greet workers and visitors alike to Asmara’s Medeber market. Here, scrap material is repurposed by welders and craftspeople to make new kitchen appliances, furniture, bicycles, household utensils, and more in Eritrea’s capital city. The open-air workshop was used as a caravan trade post in pre-colonial days, until Italian architect Odoardo Cavagnari redesigned the city of Asmara in the early 1900s, about three decades after Italy occupied and colonized Eritrea. From the very beginning, Medeber market was an upcycler’s dream of scrap metal and retired machinery. Innovative craftspeople and artisans recreated essential items that were either rare or extraordinarily expensive in Eritrea, due to high Italian importation fees. Although colonial taxes and tariffs are long past, the handiwork of Medeber’s artisans continues to fill a gap of affordability. Ovens out of oil drums, shovels out of car frames, and pots out of melted food containers—ingenuity knows no bounds here. Medeber’s welders themselves are as iconic as the market, and are known for their unique handmade welding masks made with cardboard, plastic, and other found items. One of the best-known finds at the market are the shida, sandals fashioned from old rubber tires that were so important during the Eritrean war for independence that there’s a giant statue dedicated to them in Asmara. A secondary, though no less impressive, draw of Medeber comes from the smaller spice section, where electric mills crushing ingredients together adds a layer of flavor to the market’s electric cacophony. The best-known spice is called berbere, a powerful flavor eponymous with much Eritrean cuisine. Artists also set up shop at Medeber, selling scarves, bags, clay coffee pots, religious icons, and more. Some sections of the market were damaged in a fire in 2019, but the outdoor marketplace remained largely intact and continues to be an active workspace. Visitors can find Medeber Market behind Asmara’s Nda Mariam Orthodox church and should enter at the layered brick and stone gateway topped by a turret."
36,Ben Abeba,"Lalibela, Ethiopia",An otherworldly restaurant perched on the edge of a jagged cliff next to a medieval holy city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ben-abeba,"Lalibela, Ethiopia is a holy city, a UNESCO World Heritage site famous for its 12th century churches cut into the rock of the earth. On the opposite end of the architectural spectrum, just a short walk away, is Ben Abeba, a snail shell of a building that looks more like a spaceship landed on top of that rock. Ben Abeba is a restaurant with wide-open spaces, located next to the historic architectural wonders of Lalibela. Perched high on a hill on the north side of town, it’s often described as looking like a bouquet of flowers or some sort of cooking pot. The whole enterprise was the dream of owner Susan Aitchison, a retired home economics professor who came to Ethiopia from her native Scotland, initially to help a friend set up a school. Faced with leaving such a magnificent place and going home to Glasgow, she opted to stay. A chance ride with a local transportation company owner led to a business partnership, and to one of the best restaurants in Lalibela. Aitchison and her partner, Habtamu Baye, hired local architects to put her ideas into motion, and the curved decks jutting out from the building’s central, spiraling staircase give patrons unobstructed views of the breathtaking river valley below. The award-winning restaurant serves a menu mixing traditional Ethiopian dishes and western fare, sometimes combining the two. Rising to the challenges of running a restaurant in a place with sometimes-sketchy electricity and less than reliable refrigeration, they pride themselves on giving valuable training to their young local staff, and especially their sourcing of local ingredients.  Lalibela is in northern Ethiopia, accessible by its small airport about 30 minutes outside of town. Ben Abeba is open from 7 am to 10 pm. General Manager Habtamu Baye also operates a local transportation company which can arrange transfers from local hotels."
37,Bete Giyorgis of Lalibela,"Lalibela, Ethiopia","An Ethiopian ""Jerusalem"" featuring a church hewn out of a single rock.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bete-giyorgis-lalibela,"When young Saint Gebre Mesqel Lalibela was born into the Zagwe Dynasty in Ethiopia, the town of Lalibela was known as Roha. The name Lalibela was given to the young boy when he was surrounded by a swarm of bees soon after birth. His mother believed this was a sign that he would come to rule Ethiopia one day. His name literally means, “the bees recognize his sovereignty.” Lalibela is best known as the king who ordered the construction of 11 monolithic stone churches found in the town today. Lalibela’s goal was to create a new Ethiopian Jerusalem, and he recreated many biblical scenes, such as the stable, out of carved rock. The Bete Giyorgis is by far the most spectacular of these churches. Carved out of the ground, and shaped from the inside out, it is one, unbroken piece of stone. Bete Giyorgis is connected to the other sunken stone churches through a series of elaborate tunnels. There are two versions of the church’s history: one says that the church was built after Lalibela’s death (c. 1220) by his widow as a memorial to the “saint-king.” The other claims  it was a promise  king Lalibela had made to St. George, who had been upset Lalibela had not constructed a church dedicated to him. The church is cut 40 feet down, its roof forming the shape of a Greek cross. Inside the church, there is a curtain that shields the Holy of Holies and a priest displaying books and paintings to visitors. In the shadow of one of the arms of the cruciform-shaped church is a replica of the Ark of the Covenant. Although an explorer was once allowed to open it, he found it empty. No one was able to tell him what happened to its contents. The town of Lalibela is completely isolated from the modern world. Without motor vehicles, gas stations, or paved streets, the town goes about its business as it has for hundreds of years. Religious ritual is central to the life of the town: one tenth of its population is devoted to priesthood. Regular processions, extensive fasts, and crowds of singing and dancing priests are also part of the package. The eleven solid rock churches, in the hills not far from the town, make Lalibela one of the holiest places in Ethiopia. Today, the site is considered one of the centers of pilgrimages for Ethiopian Christians. This atmosphere combined with the religious architecture and simplicity of the town’s way of life, gives the city of Lalibela “a distinctively timeless, almost biblical atmosphere.”"
38,Dallol,"Afar Zone 2, Ethiopia",The hottest place on the planet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dallol,"In the north of Ethiopia, hours from any populated area, is a vast expanse of brutal landscape unlike anywhere else in the world. Dallol, in the Danakil Depression, is a boiling, salt-formed world completely hostile to human visitors. The Danakil Depression, also known as the Afar Depression, holds the distinction of being one of the lowest and hottest parts of the world. On top of average temperatures of 94 degrees Fahrenheit, Dallol itself is surrounded by boiling hot springs, bringing hot minerals and toxic gas bubbles to the surface. Despite making Dallol uninhabited, these geological forces have actually made the area somewhat picturesque, coloring the lowlands with rusty orange, yellow, and green salt formations. Dallol is extremely unwelcoming to inhabitation. However, a number of people have still ventured into the region for work, due to the high deposits of table salt in the area. Expeditions funded by Europe prior to World War I were shut down and dismantled throughout the first half of the 20th century. Later attempts by American, Indian, and Italian companies have resulted in thousands of mines throughout the region, but no permanent settlement. Although it is now uninhabited, small structures made of salt bricks were created by the Afar people, when they were employed by mining companies throughout the 20th century. However, the majority of these have been abandoned and few traces of these settlements still exist. Near the Dallol area in the same region is Erta Ale, the “Gateway to Hell,” a smoking volcanic terrain complete with its own lava lakes. It is an equally harsh and unforgiving environment, and nearly impossible to reach without great difficulty."
39,Erta Ale,"Afar Zone 2, Ethiopia","Ethiopia's ""smoking mountain"" is in one of the hottest regions on the planet and is home to two lava lakes.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/erta-ale,"Located in the Danakil Depression (or Afar Depression) in the Afar Region of northeastern Ethiopia, Erta Ale is one of the driest, lowest and hottest places on earth. Temperatures during the year range from 77°F to 118°F. The area is beset by drought, bereft of trees, and has little in the way of roads. Known by the Afar as the “smoking mountain” and “the gateway to hell,” Erta Ale is a 2,011-foot-high constantly active basaltic shield volcano. It is one of only a handful of continuously active volcanos in the world, and a member of an even more exclusive group: volcanos with lava lakes. While there are only five known volcanos with lava lakes globally, Erta Ale often has two active lava lakes – making it a unique site. Erta Ale was discovered in 1906, making it the longest-known lava lake. For a lava lake to exist, the surface of the lake and the magma chamber below must form a constant convecting system, or the entire thing will cool and solidify. Beneath the ground surrounding Erta Ale is an enormous pool of active magma. The lake goes through cycles and will cool, form a black layer on top, and then suddenly convect back into liquid lava. Occasionally, due to pressure, “fountains” of lava will form, spewing lava in 6- to 13-foot-high plumes. The volcano itself has erupted in 1873, 1903, 1940, 1960, 1967, and 2005, when it killed hundreds of livestock and forced thousands to flee. In 2007 lava flows once again forced evacuation and two people went missing, and were presumably killed. Despite the harsh conditions, danger of volcanic eruption, and extreme heat, Erta Ale has become something of a tourist destination recently. Whereas in 2002 the area was accessible only by helicopter, today adventure tourism groups take trips to the volcano lakes and it is now possible to drive within 4.3 miles of the volcano. Recent reports indicate that the level of the lake has gone down significantly and the lava is now obscured from view by smoke. Check with recent visitors (not tour companies) before you go or you may be surprised when you’re unable to see the lava you’ve been seeing in photographs."
40,Manyate Coffee Village,"Bale Mountains National Park, Ethiopia",An Ethiopian cloud forest protects some of the last wild arabica plants.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/manyate-coffee-village,"The Harenna forest lies about 250 miles southeast of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Protected within Bale Mountains National Park, the rainforest hides a tangle of flora beneath the shroud of an often-present, low-lying cloud. And tucked among the dense greenery grows some of the world’s last wild coffee. Most people have never tasted wild coffee. Farmers who cultivate the crop are almost exclusively responsible for all commercially-available beans. Ethiopia is home to some of the last remaining wild arabica plants (according to a 2017 study, nearly 60 percent of the world’s wild coffee is under threat of extinction). You can sample a cup made from these plants at Manyate Coffee Village, situated on Harenna’s southern edge. Here, at an altitude of around 5,250 feet, arabica flourishes under the shade of massive, mossy trees. Farmers living in the area depend on the crop for income, and approximately 3,000 individuals gather coffee cherries from the Harenna forest. Harvesters select the bright red fruit by hand, a process that, according to Slow Food International, “is often obstructed by baboons.” After collection, no processing or cleaning is required; farmers simply leave their yield to dry in suspended nets or beneath the sun. Residents of Manyate established a community group known as the Sankate Association to better develop the forest’s small-scale industries. Visitors can try native coffee and honey, purchase artisan crafts, go camping, and take guided tours. Sankate’s coffee house offers traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremonies, and, during harvest season, guests can pluck their own ripened cherries.  Bale Mountains National Park is responsible for a variety of important natural features. Locals also practice traditional forms of beekeeping and honey collection from beehives housed in the forest. The mountain nyala, an endangered species of antelope, lives in the park's highlands. Instructions for reaching Bale can be found here."
41,Abuna Yemata Guh,"East Tigray, Ethiopia","Reaching the ""Church in the Sky"" requires scaling the cliff face of a sandstone pinnacle with a 650-foot drop.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abuna-yemata-guh-church,"If you think going to a normal church can be an enlightening experience, imagine going to worship in a rock-hewn painted cave atop a towering sandstone pinnacle, only reachable via a daredevil climb with 650-foot drops on all sides. At Abuna Yemata Guh in northern Ethiopia, this risky and thrilling experience is common practice for a few dedicated priests. The monolithic place of worship is said to be the world’s most inaccessible and dangerous church, reachable only by a 45-minute ascent. The journey has cliff faces to scale, rickety bridges to cross, and narrow ledges to traverse. After crossing through the valley that underlies the church, you must ascend the half-mile-high sandstone pinnacle, searching for rare footholds to avoid the long drop. Adding to the general sense of dread, the route passes by an open-air tomb filled with the skeletal remains of deceased priests (although it’s said that none of the priests died from falling off the cliff). If the intense climb and the gorgeous view of the valley below aren’t enough to take your breath away, the interior of the church surely will. The cave’s ceiling is covered by two beautiful frescoes, featuring intricate patterns, religious imagery, and the faces of nine of the twelve apostles of Christ. The church also contains an Orthodox Bible with vibrant, colorful sheets made of goatskin. Abuna Yemata Church is so sacred that some Ethiopian parents even risk bringing their babies all the way to the top of the cliff to have them baptized there. The church is named after Father Yemata, a priest who carved the church out of the cliff face in the 5th century. Some say he chose the high location to escape enemies, while others believe it was an attempt to find true divinity. Either way, his rock-hewn masterpiece has provided a unique opportunity for Ethiopian Christians to demonstrate their commitment to their faith in epic fashion."
42,Chapel of the Tablet,"Aksum, Ethiopia","Supposedly this Ethiopian chapel holds the Ark of the Covenant, guarded by virgins who cannot leave the building.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chapel-of-the-tablet,"The popular image of the Ark of the Covenant was immortalized in Raiders of the Lost Ark,  but supposedly the real life Ark is held in this Ethiopian chapel, guarded by a virgin sentinel who must never leave the building. The Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion is said to have existed in some form on this spot since around the 4th century CE. As the story goes, the Ark was brought to Ethiopia, by the son of the Queen of Sheba, and placed in the church where it has stayed ever since. The structures of the church have been destroyed and rebuilt a number of times over the years. The current domed church building was built in the 1950s by Emperor Haile Selassie. Despite their continued claims to have the Ark stored away in the catacombs of the Chapel of the Tablet, no one seems to have seen it. The only person who is allowed to see the artifact is the Guardian of the Covenant, the appointed guard of the Ark. This guard must be a virgin and they are chosen by the previous guard prior to their death. Once a guard is chosen, they supposedly cannot leave the chapel, lest the Ark go unguarded. Not even the leader of the Ethiopian church can see the Ark. Whether or not the Ark truly resides beneath the chapel, the site still draws thousands of pilgrims each year, who come and view the chapel from outside the red fence that keep the faithful on the perimeter."
43,Obelisk of Axum,"Aksum, Ethiopia",Massive stele returned to Ethiopia after 70 years in Rome.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aksum-obelisks,"Considering the size of the Obelisk of Axum, it is truly amazing that it was transported between continents twice during the last 100 years. However, for many people in Ethiopia, the return of the massive stele was an important milestone in bolstering national pride and celebrating Ethiopia’s history. From the early 4th century B.C.E until the 10th century C.E, the Kingdom of Axum was one of the greatest powers on earth. Centered as a trade city between Persia and Rome, the city of Axum flourished in culture, power and wealth. A pagan Kingdom during its early peak, giant pillars were erected to mark the tombs of important leaders. In the 4th century, the King Ezana of Axum solidified the Kingdom’s conversion to Christianity, and stopped all pagan practices, including the erection of burial stelea such as the 80-foot Obelisk of Axum. Standing only until the 16th century, an earthquake likely toppled the obelisk, and without any importance in a Christian society it was left in multiple pieces to disintegrate back into sand. The Obelisk lay in ruin for hundreds of years until it was re-discovered by Italian soldiers during the conquest of Ethiopia in 1935. Brought back in three pieces, the 160-ton stele was taken as loot to Rome, where it was reassembled. After world war II, the UN ruled that the stele must be returned to Ethiopia, but complications arose almost immediately. After years of fighting and delays, the Obelisk was finally returned to Ethiopia in 2007. The pieces were re-assembled and the Obelisk was placed near two other famous stelea; the Great Stelea standing at 108 feet, and the King Ezana stele, erected to the King that outlawed their use when he brought Christianity to his kingdom."
44,The Afar Rift,"Afar Zone 1, Ethiopia","An ocean in the making, in the Ethiopian desert.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-afar-rift-afar-zone-1-ethiopia,"Plate tectonics is not a spectator activity. The Afar Depression, for example, pulls apart at the staggering rate of less than an inch per year. Given 30 million years, however, even slow progressions such as this one can produce dramatic results. The Arabian and African Plates meet in the Afar Desert in Northern Ethiopia, and in 2005 a 10-day period of seismic activity led to a 35 mile rift that is over 20 feet wide at certain points. The eruption of Dabbahu, a volcano at the northern edge of the rift, signaled the start of a series of volcanic breaches in the Earth’s crust that shot magma and clouds of ash into the sky and sent earthquakes throughout the region. Researchers have taken particular interest in the Afar Rift because of new studies indicating that changes observed there mimic those that occur in ocean formation thousands of miles below sea-level. Indeed, it is now believed that within the next million years the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden will both pour into the Depression and meet, creating a new ocean in what is now desert. Scientists hope that by studying the Rift they might gain insight into processes that have, up until this point, been shrouded in mystery. Activity in underwater mantle usually occurs too deep in the ocean to be monitored by current technology, and already the data from the 2005 eruptions have challenged theories as to how oceans were created."
45,Yemrehanna Kristos Church,Ethiopia,An ancient Ethiopian cave church is endangered by the simple building of a road.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yemrehana-krestos-church,"The ancient Yemrehanna Kristos Church in Ethiopia is not only located in a cave, but may be one of the most elaborate churches of its kind in the entire country. Believed to have been built between the 11th and 12th century, the wood and plaster church is nestled inside a natural cavern that has likely kept the church from deteriorating completely over its centuries of service. The exterior of the church face consists of stacked layers of protruding stonework interlaced with wooden beams. The windows are covered with wooden cruciform designs and the main door is said to have been taken from a nearby palace. Inside the church, the walls are covered in wood paneling. There are also tall wooden arches which have delicate designs carved into their every surface. Over the centuries, the church has been a relatively popular pilgrimage site where devoted pilgrims were known to come to die. Their bones are buried behind the church into the cave wall. The church is still in active service to this day, and a security wall has been erected over the cave mouth to keep the site safe. Although the church is far off the beaten path, a new road has brought newfound attention and visitors which may jeopardize the safety of the ancient architecture. In the interest of retaining the site’s unique historical value, the Yemrehanna Kristos Church was recently placed on the 2014 World Monuments Watch list of important places to preserve."
46,Hadar Archaeological Site,"Shinile, Ethiopia","The skeletal remains of the famous hominid ""Lucy"" were found at this spot.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hadar-lucy-hominid-skeleton,"On November 24, 1974, paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson spotted something odd poking out from a dry gully within the archeological site around Hadar, Ethiopia. There, a thin arm bone was visible against the dry, dusty earth. Johanson kept looking and soon found additional skeletal remains—a femur here, some ribs there—scattered nearby. By the end of the excavation, Johanson and his colleagues had unearthed about 40 percent of a roughly 3.2 million-year-old skeleton. These bits of bone were the only pieces they could work with while puzzling together the identity of “Lucy,” the now world-famous hominid. Though officially named AL 288-1, Lucy was given her more popular moniker as a nod to the Beatles song that was played repeatedly during the camp’s celebrations honoring her discovery. By studying her remains, the researchers were eventually able to determine that Lucy is a member of the Australopithecus afarensis species, a hominid that went extinct about 2.9 million years ago. After reading the clues hidden in the fragments of her skeleton, they also concluded that the ancient female walked upright and died when she was only a young adult. Lucy’s skeleton wasn’t the only hominid unearthed at Hadar. The fossilized skull of Selam, a three-year-old hominid that died about 3.3 million years ago, was discovered during a later dig. Other hominid remains have been found spread throughout the sedimentary rocks as well."

Ethiopia is known for its rich wealth of megalithic sites and well preserved prehistoric finds, but the 30-some stones located in the Tiya region are among the most remarkable. Each of the squat stone obelisks is carved with primitive, yet clear images of swords, geometric shapes, and figures. Despite a healthy amount of research at the site, no one has been able to determine the exact age or purpose of the stones, although popular thinking has it that they served a funerary function due to some tombs which were found nearby. Whatever the true use of the carved rocks, they offer a relatively pristine glimpse back to a time we know little about. Take Route 7 south of Addis and then go south on Route 9. The stelae are near the Lina Drug Store."

Anywhere between 500,000 and 750,000 people were tortured and killed during the brutality. The museum is a memorial to the martyrs who fought against the dictator’s violent military campaign. Although the museum is modern, clean, and well presented, it doesn’t pull any punches. It’s full of coffins, bloodied clothes, and images that tell the story of this devastating period in the country’s history. One particular room contains a number of glass-fronted partitions displaying the remains and personal effects of people killed by the regime. The remains had been exhumed and placed in the museum as they had been found. Some of them even included the rope used to strangle the person. Each partition also includes a photo of the victim. Ethiopia’s “Red Terror” reached its height between 1977 and 1978. Men, women, and children from various ethnic groups were tortured and killed under the dictator’s plan to rid the country of those who allegedly opposed his party. Citizens were captured and tortured before their dead bodies were dumped in the streets. Some of the museum guides themselves are victims of the terror, pointing out that they too suffered the various methods of torture displayed in graphic detail by mannequins. The museum is free but does rely on donations. After witnessing the exhibits in this building it would be hard not to leave a generous sum."
49,Gaet’ale Pond,"Afar Zone 2, Ethiopia",The Earth's saltiest natural body of water belches toxic gas.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gaetale-pond,"Gaet’ale Pond is the saltiest naturally-occurring body of water on Earth. It also belches out toxic gas that kills small birds, insects and, potentially, humans. The Afar Depression in northern Ethiopia is one of the most tectonically active regions in the world. Shaped by volcanic activity, the floor of the depression is largely composed of lava, and the area is riddled with fascinating natural formations that bake in the scorching sun. One such feature is Gaet’ale Pond, the largest of a series of small bodies of water a few miles from Dallol, one of the hottest inhabited locations on Earth. The roughly semi-circular lake has a diameter of about 197 feet. According to locals, it was formed after an earthquake in January 2005. Despite its balmy 122-to-155-degree Fahrenheit temperature, Gaet’ale Pond is certainly not the place for a hot dip in the water. It often belches out toxic gases, as evidenced by the dead insects and birds often found near its shores, and researchers consider it a dangerous—and potentially lethal—health hazard for human visitors. But what really sets Gaet’ale Pond apart is its salt content. Thanks to volcanic processes in the area, the pond has an incredibly high salinity of 43 percent (mainly calcium chloride and magnesium chloride), making it the saltiest body of water on Earth. To put that into perspective, the water in Gaet’ale Pond is more than 12 times saltier than the water in the world’s oceans, which have a salinity of approximately 3.5 percent. The world’s most famous salty sea, the Dead Sea, has a salinity of 33.7 percent. And the world’s second saltiest body of water, Don Juan Pond in Antarctica, has a salinity of at least 33.8 percent.  Gaet’ale Pond is located about 2.5 miles to the southeast of Dallol, a sparse settlement (some call it a ghost town) in the Afar Region of northern Ethiopia. The nearest town is Berhale, about 31 miles to the southwest (as the crow flies), which is reached by heading east off Ethiopian Highway 2. The region has very minimal tourism infrastructure, so you need to plan ahead carefully. Tour companies also offer multiday trips to the Dallol area, which typically include Gaet’ale Pond. As mentioned above, be careful when approaching the pond as the gases can be harmful to humans."
50,Chemin de Fer Railway Museum,"Dire Dawa, Ethiopia",Rusting railcars and locomotive equipment fill this Ethiopian train graveyard.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chemin-de-fer-railway-museum,"Usually when a rail line is decommissioned, the cars and equipment simply disappear, sold off or thrown away, but this old Ethiopian line has been turned into a sort of rusty folk museum. The Railway Station at Dire Dawa was the only formal waystation on the railway line which operated from Djibouti on the coast to Addis Ababa in the Ethiopian highlands. The railway line which was constructed and operated by a French company the Chemin de Fer Ethiopien began operations in the reign of Emperor Menelik II and was completed in 1929. The Railway Line ceased running in the early 2000s and is currently being upgraded into a more modern service. However, when the service stopped, most of the rolling stock, trains, and carriages ended up in the Dire Dawa Station where a museum of sorts has been established. The museum is a wonderful collection of train memorabilia slowly decaying in the Ethiopian sun. One will receive a tour from the curator, an elderly man who was employed by the railway and speaks a smattering of English, fluent Amharic, and good French, the operational language of the railway. French signs can still be seen hanging in the workshops and there are railway carriages from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd classes dating from the 1950s. There are a selection of diesel engines and some minor gems such as the rusted shell of an Italian locomotive from the 1940s and some wagons supposedly gifted to the former Communist regime by Mugabe and used to transport tanks. Wandering around, with bee-eaters providing little bursts of color as they flit between the old telegraph wires, the curator is perfectly happy for all the exhibits to be handled and clambered on, actively encouraging people to “get in,” unafraid that a little bit more of an engine may crumble into the rust colored soil. Once you arrive in Dire Dawa, get a Bajaj from the airport to the Mekonnen Hotel, opposite the station. There is good beer on the veranda. The entrance to the museum is through a gateway to the left of the main station building. There will be a policeman on guard here who will likely not speak English. If persistent he will phone the curator who will arrive in about 20mins. A guide or rudimentary Amharic are helpful. There was no formal charge for the museum but contributions are welcome."
51,Lioness of Gobedra,Ethiopia,"According to one local legend, this image was created during a battle between a wild lioness and the archangel Michael.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lioness-of-gobedra,"A couple of kilometers west of the ancient city of Axum stands the isolated hill of Gobo Dura, alternatively known as Gobedra. The city in Ethiopia is known for stonework, including elaborately carved stelae and a striking work of ancient art known as the Lioness of Gobedra. It was first described to the western world by German archaeologists in 1913, but had been known to locals for far longer. The origin of the three-meter-long sculpture, engraved on a huge syenite boulder, has been a mystery for quite some time. One local story holds that the carving is a relic from a tremendous battle between a wild lioness and the archangel Michael. It is said that when Michael hurled his opponent into the rock, the impact was so great that the beast’s outline remained. The truth is still a subject of speculation, but the stone lioness is likely thousands of years old. Since it stands beside the road leading to Axum, it is possible that the rock art was an ancient landmark. This has not been confirmed, and it remains unknown when it was created, who made it, or for what purpose. Another engraving that depicts a Greek cross is also visible on the same boulder, also of unknown origins. Nearby, there is an ancient quarry called Wuchate Golo, where the famous stelae in Axum are believed to have been carved. Some uncompleted, abandoned stelae can be spotted here as well."
52,Loango National Park,"Ndougou, Gabon","The true jewel of Africa's west coast known as ""Africa's Last Eden.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/loango-national-park,"Imagine this: Walking along a pristine, uninhabited, unspoiled beach, the only sound is the waves crashing upon the shore, when you hear another less familiar sound that catches you off guard. The thundering trumpet of an elephant herd sauntering along the coastline, watchful mothers guarding their calves that frolic in the surf of the Atlantic Ocean. How about a hippopotamus caught among the waves and surfing to the shore? If this sounds impossible, you’ve never been to Loango National Park, ‘Africa’s Last Eden’. Situated between the Nkomi and Ndogo Lagoons, Loango National Park is home to a stunning diversity of habitats within its 1,550 km range, from savannas to 100 km of pristine, unoccupied beaches; from seemingly untouched virgin rain forests to the serpentine bends and gnarls of mangrove forests, Loango offers many sights for any true nature lover. Loango National Park also includes part of the 220 km² Iguéla Lagoon, the only significant example of a typical western African lagoon system that is protected entirely within a national park. For animal lovers, Loango National Park is a true paradise on earth. Gabon holds one of the highest densities of wildlife in the world, and Loango National Park proudly shows off its bountiful harvest to the world: forest elephants, hippos, red forest buffalo, leopards, crocodiles, western lowland gorillas, chimpanzees, sitatunga, duikers, a vast array of birds, a variety of different monkey species, and the world’s largest concentration of humpback whales and dolphins after South Africa. Visit while it still remains one of the few pristine places left on Earth."
53,Oklo Reactor,"Mounana, Gabon",The world's first and only natural nuclear reactor.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oklo-reactor,"Many people think nuclear power is an invention of mankind, and some even think it violates the laws of nature. But nuclear power is in fact a naturally occurring phenomenon, and life could not exist without it. That’s because our sun (and every other star for that matter) is itself a giant power plant, lighting up the solar system through a process known as thermonuclear fusion. Humans, however, generate power through a different process called nuclear fission, which releases energy by splitting atoms rather than combining them as in the fusion process. No matter how ingenious our race may seem though, even fission reactors are old news to Mother Nature. In a singular but well-documented circumstance, scientists have found evidence that naturally occurring fission reactors were created inside three uranium ore deposits in the west African country of Gabon. Two billion years ago, the uranium-rich mineral deposits became flooded with groundwater, setting off a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. The energy that was subsequently released then raised temperatures enough to begin boiling away the water, but when the mineral deposits eventually cooled down the nuclear reactions would start back up again. By examining the levels of certain isotopes of xenon gas (a byproduct of the uranium fission process) in the surrounding rock, scientists have determined the natural reactor proceeded in this start-stop fashion at intervals of about two and a half hours. In this manner, the uranium deposits in the Oklo region of Gabon created a natural nuclear power plant that operated for hundreds of thousands of years until most of the fissile uranium was depleted. While a majority of the uranium at Oklo is the non-fissile isotope U238, only about 3% needed to be the fissile isotope U235 for the chain reaction to start. Today, that percent of fissile uranium in the deposits is around 0.7%, indicating that the deposit had sustained reactions for a relatively long period of time. But it was this exact characteristic of the rocks from Oklo that first puzzled scientists. The low levels of U235 were first noticed in 1972 by employees of the Pierrelatte uranium enrichment facility in France. During routine mass spectrometry analysis of samples from the Oklo mine, it was discovered that the concentration of the fissile uranium isotope differed by three thousandths of a percent (0.003%) from the expected value. This seemingly small difference was significant enough to alert authorities, who were concerned that the missing uranium could be used to develop nuclear weapons. But later that year, scientists found the answer to the two-billion-year-old secret: the world’s first, and only natural, nuclear reactor."
54,Kakum Canopy Walk,"Assin South, Ghana",This series of rope-style bridges brings visitors into a jungle layer that is usually reserved for birds and monkeys.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kakum-canopy-walk,"Unique on the African continent, the Kakum Canopy Walk allows hikers to experience a portion of the jungle usually reserved for climbers and fliers thanks to a trail of precariously hung suspension bridges. Located in the thick tropical jungle of Kakum National Park, the canopy walk was actually designed by a pair of Canadian engineers and five Ghanaians. Looking to increase tourism (specifically ecotourism) in the largely ignored national park, the designers wanted to create a unique feature that would make the park a destination, thus an elevated trail through the canopy was devised. Opened on Earth Day in 1995, the canopy walkway consists of seven separate bridges that hang from the trees over 130 feet above the ground. Across over 1,000 feet of walkway, the bridges look as though they are constructed like a traditional rope bridge made from the materials of the forest, however the sturdy spans are made of wire rope, aluminum, and wooden planks, and even have safety netting to keep people from plummeting off the trail. Easiest to visit by car but you can easily find a taxi for a day trip in Cape Coast. Also worth stopping for lunch at Hans Cottage Botel, where you can pet a crocodile."
55,La Tante DC 10,"Accra, Ghana","This grounded passenger jet is now a restaurant, complete with rows of seats and “flight attendant” servers.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-tante-dc-10,"Anyone can board the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 passenger jet parked on Airport Road. The aircraft sits along the route to Kotoka International Airport in Accra, Ghana’s capital city, but it won’t take you anywhere. However, the food is a far cry from the tray of disappointment that most passengers are accustomed to picking at while aboard a plane. Now a restaurant known as La Tante DC 10, this aircraft was once operated by Ghana Airways on flights to Europe and the United States. In 2005, the DC-10 ended up impounded at London’s Heathrow airport as a result of unpaid company debts. Nearly a decade later, a business partnered with Ghana Airports Company Limited, to transform the retired vehicle into an eatery. Today, curious visitors and residents alike can enjoy unique meal service delivered by waitstaff in flight attendant uniforms. Customers board just as they would an operational vessel, by embarking up a covered stairway. For some, it’s their first look inside an airplane. The plane’s new management reduced capacity from 380 seats to 118, clearing space for wider walkways and dining tables. First-class seats accented with festive pillows serve as a waiting area and bar seating, while the economy section houses the dining room, which is composed of tables with rows of airplane seats facing each other. Menu offerings include an extensive array of traditional cuisine, as well as international dishes. Foreign fare, such as spaghetti and sandwiches, populate one section of the menu, but the “Proud to be Ghanian” page offers diners a selection of the country’s authentic culinary mainstays. Don’t miss local specialties such as palm nut soup, grilled tilapia, and garden eggs stew. Update as of February 2023: The restaurant no longer has a dine-in option on the plane. They only offer food to go and do not allow you into the plane. It is unclear if this is permanent.  The restaurant is located just a few minutes away from the terminals at Kotoka International Airport. If you are coming in through the Holiday Inn side of the restaurant, you may encounter security. Simply let them know you're heading to the restaurant. Hours are 12:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m."
56,Cape Coast Castle,"Cape Coast, Ghana","Where thousands of slaves passed through the ""Door of No Return.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cape-coast-castle,"When President Obama visited Ghana’s Cape Coast Castle in July, 2009, he remarked that “it reminds us of the capacity of human beings to commit great evil.” This castle in Cape Coast, Ghana—once known as the Gold Coast of West Africa—was one of around 40 “slave castles” that served as prisons and embarkation points for slaves en route to the Americas (the Caribbean, South America, and the U.S.). Thousands of enslaved Africans from regions near and far, sometimes hundreds of miles away, were taken to these castles to be sold to slave ships. One of the most well known parts of Cape Coast Castle, that you can visit today, is the “Door of No Return,” which led slaves out of the castle and onto the ships setting off on the Middle Passage. Their boat journeys could last several months, and an estimated 15 percent of slaves died aboard, en route. Somewhere around 12 millions slaves were sent from Africa, millions of whom died in the process. Cape Coast Castle was a way station in history’s largest, and darkest, forced human migration. The history of the castle, which could also be termed a fort, is predictably complicated and contentious. Possession of it was stolen back and forth as the slave trade grew bigger and more lucrative in the 1600s and 1700s. The site’s first establishment was built by the Swedish Africa Company, whose officers had established good relations with local chiefs. In 1650, Swede Hendrik Caerloff finagled the King of Fetu’s permission to build a fort, and in 1653, Carlusborg Fort was erected. It was snatched by the Danish West India Company in 1657, and seized back and forth between the Danish, Dutch, and Swedes, competitors in the growing slave economy. When the King of Fetu died in 1663, the Dutch seized control for a hot second before the British swooped in, in 1664. The British renamed it Cape Coast Castle and managed to maintain possession, though there were a few close calls. In 1757, for example, an attack by the French badly damaged the fort, leading to a complete reconstruction. Tens of thousands of bricks and tiles were imported from England in 1797 for the reconstruction effort, which was also intended to expand the castle’s slave-holding capacity. When you visit Cape Coast Castle today, the main destination in the calm and breezy seaside town of Cape Coast, you can tour the entire expansive building, from the ramparts lined with cannons to the nearly lightless dungeons. These dungeons, called “slave holes” by the British, had essentially no ventilation nor windows, with 200 slaves, separated by gender, crammed in one room, and the floor covered in human waste. Diseases like malaria and yellow fever were common under such wretched conditions. As many as 1,500 slaves (two-thirds of whom were male) were held in the castle dungeons at any one time. When you walk through the dungeons today, it is terrifying to imagine the reality of what took place in these suffocating spaces just over two centuries ago. Then, moments later, you’ll be out of the dungeons and wandering by the church or strolling down long hallways leading to officer’s quarters with pleasant views over the sea—two adjacent spaces set entire worlds apart. The Brits formally declared the slave trade illegal in 1807, though Cape Coast Castle remained their local headquarters on the Gold Coast until 1877. The British Public Works Department later restored the premises in 1920s, and retained ownership right up until Ghana’s independence in 1957, at which point the castle came under the purview of the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board. Though the remains of other slave castles exist along the former Gold Coast, Cape Coast Castle is one of the most well restored and well known. It is well worth a visit to remind each of us of the many corners of the globe involved in the former slave trade—and a reminder that many more such corners still exist. Cape Coast can be reached by car or bus (a tro tro is your best bet) from Accra, Ghana's capital city. Travel time will probably be between three to four hours."
57,Sacred Crocodile Ponds of Paga,"Paga, Ghana",The souls of the dead have made these Ghanese crocodiles shockingly docile.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sacred-crocodile-ponds-of-paga,"Along Ghana’s northern border, many villagers are inside of crocodiles. Luckily, they have not been eaten; the reptiles simply hold their souls. In the town of Paga, nestled right up against Burkina Faso, is a sacred crocodile pond where locals believe that crocodiles hold the souls of the village’s deceased. High profile deaths in the community have even coincided with the deaths of some of the sacred crocodiles. Ancestors’ souls or not, the crocodiles of the sacred pond in Paga are protected and allegedly as safe as any domesticated pet. The residents of Paga certainly treat them as such, regularly interacting with the 110 crocodiles in the main crocodile sanctuary, Chief’s Pond. What’s even more stunning, no one has ever been harmed by one of the crocodiles. Young children swim in the pond and Ghanaians along with tourists are invited to touch and practically play with the reptiles. The people of the town wash clothes next to the bumpy ridges of the crocodiles’ jaws without a hint of fear. Even more remarkable than the docile nature of this crocodile population, is how these massive crocodiles made the pond their home. The pond is completely landlocked and apparently the oldest beasts in the water are over 80 years old. Yet here they are, ready and waiting for tourists to feed them live chickens, sit on them, or lift their spiny tails. Crocodiles have been on earth for over 200 million years, even outliving the dinosaurs. And more importantly, their behavior in Paga is without comparison. For the legions of tourists seeking a wild Africa full of the world’s most impressive and dangerous beasts, Paga’s a good start to their journey. A small fee to a local tour guide is required for interpretation and the purchase of the crocodile’s live chicken dinner. Paga is North of Bolgatonga near the border of Ghana and Burkina Faso."
58,Mole National Park,"West Gonja, Ghana",At Ghana's largest wildlife refuge you feel like you're right in the animals' backyard.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mole-national-park,"As you walk around the restaurant and visitor’s center at Mole National Park, you’ll pass by warthogs wandering along on their way, possibly even an elephant that has strayed from the group. At Ghana’s largest wildlife refuge, life is relaxed and no one is in a rush to get anywhere. Mole National Park (pronounced Moh-lay) is located in northwest Ghana, about 90 miles from the major city of Tamale. The grounds are still fairly undeveloped and untouristed due to the park’s remote location, which makes it feel like you are truly wandering around the animals’ backyard. The park was established in 1964, though the land was first set aside as a game reserve in 1958, a year after Ghana’s independence from Britain. The park spans about 3,000 square miles, fed by the seasonal Lovi and Mole rivers. On the grounds there is a motel and pool that look from a cliffside out across the savanna woodland, from which you can watch herds of elephants meandering by the water holes below. The park is home to 90 mammalian species (including five types of primates), 734 species of flower plants, 56 butterfly species, and enough bird species to attract avid birders—at least 300 species, including the white-backed vulture and Senegal parrot. However, because of the few dozen villages located near the park boundaries, subsistence hunting continues to pose a problem for preserving the wildlife. What’s more, the elephants’ former migration route into southern Burkina Faso has been obstructed by human settlement, and seemingly less frequented as a result. You can take jeep safari tours around the park’s rust red dirt roads, and are often able to get right up close to the elephants (there are around 500 total) and possibly pass by antelopes, hippos, hartebeests, buffalo and monkeys. The poor maintenance of the roads—which access only a small fraction of the park—is a loss to visitors, but a gain for the wildlife. The park is 146km (90 miles) southeast of the major city of Tamale. The best way to get there is a bus, shared car, or van, through which you can likely arrange transport both ways."
59,Tengzug Shrine,"Bolgatanga, Ghana",Topless shrine of northern Ghana.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tengzug-shrine,"The Talensis people of Northern Ghana require you to be topless to observe one of their sacred rituals. With the smell of animal blood and feces bombarding their senses, man and woman alike must bare themselves to the sub-Saharan heat to enter the Tengzug Shrine in the Tongo Hills. The Tengzug Shrine, one of the most famous in the region, was once a hideout for slaves evading their captors. Now, it is used more traditionally for religious animal sacrifices for good luck and to please the ancestors of the Talensis. With a guide, visitors can scale the rocks up to the Tengzug Shrine, remove their tops and witness the sacrifice of birds and chickens. In the shrine, among the remnants of the recently sacrificed, visitors get a panoramic view of the region and the surreal world of the Tongo Hills. Giant Baobab trees and boulders define the dry landscape that draws both tourists and religious pilgrims. The Tongo Hills comprise only twenty square kilometers, but are richly packed with history, religious significance, and fantastic hiking. Along with the many shrines tucked away in the rock formations of the area, the local population has rebuilt a number of classic Talensis homes. Shaped like cylinders and grouped into neighborhoods, the homes have miniature doorways, followed by a short wall inside the home that allows for protection from intruders. Other than the doorway and a few holes for smoke to exit the structure, they are completely closed off to the outside world. The Tongo Hills give visitors a window into the world of the Talensis, and visitors coming at the right times can experience one of the region’s vibrant festivals. In March, the Talensi celebrate the Golob Festival focusing on the sowing of the fields. With a bit more show to it, the Bo’araam Festival in October and November includes drinking traditional beer and the sacrifice of donkeys, goats, and fowl.

60,Larabanga Mosque,"Larabanga, Ghana","The first mosque in Ghana is known as the ""Mecca of West Africa.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/larabanga-mosque,"The Larabanga Mosque is the oldest in all of Ghana, possibly in all of West Africa. It has survived for centuries despite inclement weather and bad reconstruction projects. As the legend goes, Ayuba, a Moorish trader, was traveling across the Sahara in 1421 when he spent the night in the village of Larabanga. He received instructions in a dream to construct a mosque in the village, and when he awoke the foundations had already been set for him. He built the mosque in the traditional Sudanic-Sahelian style, from mud and reeds. Each side of the building bore a separate entrance: one for men, one for women, one for Larabanga’s chief, and one for the muezzin who calls the community to prayer. Ayuba remained in Larabanga for the rest of his life, and when his remains were buried beneath a nearby baobab tree, the leaves were said to have special healing powers. By the 1970s the mosque was badly deteriorated and in need of reconstruction. A reconstruction crew applied cement to the walls in the hopes of strengthening them, but the mixture allowed moisture to penetrate the ancient wooden beams. A termite infestation followed, and a storm toppled the weakened minaret. With support from the World Monuments Fund, the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board, and American Express, the conservators then employed local artisans to fix their mistakes. They carefully removed the cement and reapplied a mud paste much like Ayuba had used 550 years prior. The minaret was rebuilt, the walls were whitewashed, and the mosque was restored to its former glory. Today, perhaps because of the mistakes of the 20th century, the mosque is largely maintained by the local community. They still worship in the ancient building, but they also reap the profits of the many tourists who come to visit the holy site.  If you can, find a man from the village named Ibrahim. He works with the local orphanage and at Mole, and can help you coordinate a visit to the mosque. He is very passionate about his community and wants to share his culture with visitors. The official viewing fee for the mosque is GH¢ 1.00. Non-Muslims are not allowed to enter the mosque."
61,Ga-Adangbe Caskets - Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop,"Accra, Ghana",The clever workshop that has been designing some of the most unusual coffins imaginable.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ga-adangbe-caskets,"When members of the Ga-Adangbe in Ghana die, they move into their next life and affect the living from beyond the grave. To guarantee smooth transfer into the next world, their descendants bury them in elaborate coffins, made to symbolize their lives. In the 1950s, a fisherman from Accra was buried in a fish-shaped coffin. He had made his livelihood from the sea and wanted to move into his next life in a reflection of the being that had supported him. Shortly after the first symbolic fish coffin was built, a number of skilled carpenters popularized the practice around Accra. Seth Kane Kwei, one of the original creators of the coffins, opened the first special workshop dedicated to making the specialized caskets and the trade began to blossom. Coffins range from representations of careers, such as the fish or a taxicab, to more detailed depictions of the deceased habits. Alcohol bottle and cigarette-shaped coffins portraying the vice of the dead is also not unknown. Anything representing the life of the family member is chosen, and serves as the vessel guiding the deceased to their next life. Today, the Ga-Adangbe are well known for their coffins, which often appear bizarre to Western visitors used to solemn funerary rights. Although Ga funerals are still a sad event, the unique coffins allow them to celebrate the life of the deceased and cull favor with their ancestors. Even though many Ga have very low income, they spend massive amounts to buy the specialized coffins, which can cost anywhere from $50 to $600. Kwei’s sons and grandsons are still designing caskets in a quirky variety of shapes. Their creations range from bananas and robots to firetrucks and spoons - whatever most encapsulates the spirit and personality of the loved one."
62,Black Star Square,"Accra, Ghana",An enormous public square and parade ground built to celebrate Ghana's independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/black-star-square,"In 1957, the Ghanaian politician and revolutionary leader Kwame Nkrumah led the Gold Coast, now Ghana, to its independence from Britain. Nkrumah became the first prime minister and president of Ghana, and to celebrate his nation’s newfound autonomy, he commissioned the construction of a huge public square. Black Star Square, also known as Independence Square, is located in Accra, Ghana, and is now the site for all the major military and civic parades in the Ghanaian capital. It was completed in 1961 to coincide with the state visit of Queen Elizabeth II. The young Queen was keen to keep the unstable African republic within the Commonwealth, and was adamant on making the tour of Ghana despite a spate of bombings that were rocking Accra in protest of Nkrumah’s rule. From the first parades in honor of the Queen’s visit all the way up to the present day, Black Star Square has hosted all of the country’s major national public gatherings, national festivals, military parades, concerts, and occasional fashion shows. None of these are more important than the Independence Day parades held in the square each year on March 6. To accommodate spectators at these events, large stands with a total seating capacity of 30,000 surround the edges of the square. And while these stands and the square itself are packed with people during events, the vast space tends to be all but empty on a typical day, save for a few soldiers and a scattering of tourists who come to see the principal monuments that sit on and around the park. These monuments include the Independence Arch to the south of the square, backdropped by the Gulf of Guinea. On the opposite side of the square but facing the arch is the Memorial of the Unknown Soldier, which honors the Ghanaian soldiers who fell fighting for their country. Just to the north of the main square is a roundabout, in the center of which stands the Black Star Gate, an imposing monument topped by the Black Star of Africa, the five-pointed star that symbolizes Africa in general and Ghana in particular. The monument bears the large inscription “AD 1957” and “Freedom and Justice.” In terms of overall size, there is an oft-repeated claim that Black Star Square is the second largest city square in the world after Tiananmen Square in Beijing. That, however, is wrong on a few counts. Firstly, Tiananmen Square is not the largest square in the world, but does sit comfortably in the top 10. Secondly, Black Star Square has an approximate area of 1,057,238 square feet (98,220 sq meters), and that’s a generous approximation. That could maybe squeeze the square into the world’s top 30 at best, perhaps rivaling Millennium Park in Chicago. And then, of course, there’s the whole definition of city parks, parade grounds etc. Still, it’s fair to say that Black Star Square could well be the largest square of its type in Africa, and that’s no mean achievement.  Black Star Square is located between 28th February Road and Accra's southern coastline. It's always open to the public unless there are ticketed events taking place. Be careful when taking photographs of the square and its monuments. Since 2011, the Independence Arch has been guarded by a handful of soldiers who prohibit people taking close-up photos of the Arch. It's best to always ask permission before taking any photos of monuments on the square, especially if they're being guarded by soldiers."
63,Agbogbloshie,"Accra, Ghana",The world’s largest digital waste dump has become a site where organized criminals hack into confidential government data.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/agbogbloshie,"Between 1960 and 1965, the GDP of Ghana increased by nearly 50%. As the country’s economy industrialized, migrants from the rural parts of Ghana flocked to Accra, the largest city in the country, in search of economic relief. The migrants lived in a large slum on the outskirts of Accra called “Old Fadama.” The impoverished neighborhood grew in the 1980s, when another wave of migrants entered the city, fleeing Ghana’s Konkomba-Nanumba War. The residents who settled in Old Fadama were densely packed - up to 20 Ghanaians sleeping in a single 40 square foot kiosk - with little clean water or health services to be found. This neighborhood was much like other deeply poverty-stricken areas - that is, until the early 2000s, when the first ships arrived filled with electronic waste - old computers, cameras, television sets, and everything in between - from the United States, Japan, and Europe. The developed world saw Ghana as a dumping ground for their digital leftovers, as it’s cheaper to send unprocessed e-waste off in bulk to a developing country than it is to actually recycle it. This activity is illegal under the Basel Convention, but the rich nations used the legal loophole of classifying the garbage as “donations” to “bridge the digital divide” between the developed and developing world. Suddenly, a section of Old Fadama was designated as a digital dumping ground, known as “Agbogbloshie.” In the years following the first e-waste, the Korle Lagoon, located inside Agbogbloshie, became one of the most polluted bodies of water on the planet, with levels of toxins 100 times the acceptable amount. At the same time, the young children of Agbogbloshie began to burn the e-waste for trace precious metals, earning them four to six dollars per day, but in the process exposing their young bodies to toxic and carcinogenic substances, causing, among other things, a lead poisoning rate of 80%. Life in Agbogbloshie was so bad that the region was nicknamed “Sodom and Gomorrah” after the two Biblical cities synonymous with harsh living conditions. However there was another valuable asset sitting in this Ghanaian e-dump: secrets. When e-waste is shipped from the United States and other Western countries to Ghana, the data is sometimes not properly overwritten or erased - and even if it is, there are unerasable pieces of data called “bad sectors”, which are unreachable by a computer’s transistors and cannot be overwritten. On certain computers, no matter how hard you try, you can’t completely delete every file that goes to an e-dump. This is a problem, or an opportunity, depending on who you are. Agbogbloshie is filled with hundreds of organized criminals who recover gigabytes of information from the personal computers of ordinary Americans. They can find credit card information, private financial data, and personal memorabilia. The US government even dumps their old electronics in Agbogbloshie, many of which contain classified government documents. Once they are dumped, there is a chance that someone will uncover the secret data, and in fact they have. Organized criminals have uncovered secret multi-million dollar agreements from the Defence Intelligence Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, and the TSA. These are the unintended consequences, besides the lead poisoning, cancer, and general horror, of rich nations treating someone else’s home as their trashcan."

It is said to have belonged to Okomfo Anokye, a leader of the Ashanti people who plunged it into the earth hundreds of years ago. Kwame Frimpong Anokye, popularly known as Okomfo Anokye, was a traditional priest and leader of the Ashanti people of Ghana. He helped establish new laws and customs to help reduce the influence of old traditional customs that were negatively influencing its people. Okomfo, which means priest, was an acquired title as he was believed to possess special abilities of healing and of controlling nature. The sword was used by Okomfo Anokye as a symbol to signify peace and unity among the Ashanti Empire. According to local history, the sword was pushed into the ground over 300 years ago. It is believed that Okomfo Anokye pronounced the sword to be immovable, and so it has remained. This is not due to lack of trying—there have been many attempts, including by well-known figures such as Mohammed Ali, who attempted to remove the sword in 1994. The sword has also attracted much attention over the years and even that of the Queen of England in 1961. The Okomfo Anokye sword site is also home to the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, as the site is said to be a healing ground. It is also home to the famous golden stool of Asantema, where it was said to have descended from."

The Centre d’Art Acrobatique Keita Fodeba (Keita Fodeba Centre for Acrobatic Arts) in Conakry, Guinea, trains its young students to perform spectacular acrobatic feats that have astounded audiences world over. The center was founded in 1998 and it recruits street children and youth to train in acrobatics and contortionism, and also offers pre-professional training and literacy programs. The institution is a training hub for some of Africa’s greatest contortionists and acrobats. Performers from the school have toured internationally in Europe and North America and have sought to work with Cirque du Soleil and other acts. At any given time, it houses around 50 students, aging between 10 and 20. The school’s work has received acclaim from critics and activists alike, and it has been supported by UNICEF. Visitors are able to come watch the acrobats rehearse in the mornings in their training space near the Dixinn Stadium. The agility and enthusiasm of the young performers make it well worth the visit. Shows are also held in other venues in Conakry. Hours are approximately 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. but may vary."
66,Tourist Office of Mali-ville,"Mali, Guinea",This small building is a living testament to the remoteness and warmth of the town that it represents.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tourist-office-of-mali-ville-guinea,"No traveller arrives in Mali, a town in the far north of Guinea’s mountainous Fouta Djallon region, without a story to tell. Mali, which is sometimes referred to as Mali-ville to distinguish it from the neighboring country of the same name, is as remote as it is beautiful. The town sits among rolling green mountains that include Guinea’s highest point. Crisp weather and incredibly welcoming people give the area a special feel. There are basically two ways to reach Mali-ville. You could bump over difficult roads in utterly packed transport for several days from Conakry, or hike or motorbike up across barely extant trails from across the Senegalese border. Coming from Senegal takes two days and requires sleeping the night in the forest or, if you’re lucky, in one of the several villages on the way that exist off the road and electricity network. Given the difficult journey, it feels absolutely right and just that the local tourism board maintains an active office to welcome any visitors. The office acts as a food and stationary shop most of the time. But when a visitor arrives, they provide warm welcomes and seem genuinely delighted that someone has come to town. The office has a fascinating board which shows the number of tourists who have arrived in Mali every year since 1999, when only 20 visitors came through. There have been ups and downs since then, with a peak of 1,300, but always this remote Tourist Office has stood by, ready to give them a proper welcome.  It makes sense to come here first when you arrive in Mali. You will be asked to pay a very small per-visitor fee (around 2,000 CFA in 2019) and will get a chance to set up accommodations, tours in the area, or any other service. No addresses are noted in Mali, but any local will be able to point you to the ""Bureau Tourisme."""
