0,Hand of Timba,"Bissau, Guinea-Bissau",This monument memorializes a violent massacre where colonial police killed 50 striking dockworkers.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hand-of-timba,"A short walk from the Port of Bissau stands a large, fist-shaped sculpture known as the Mão de Timba (Hand of Timba). This monument along the Geba River commemorates a critical event in the history of Guinea-Bissau’s fight for independence. For centuries, the people of Guinea-Bissau lived under Portuguese colonial rule. Portuguese traders first showed up in the early 15th-century in what was then the kingdom of Kaabu, a region subordinate to the powerful Mali empire. In 1687, the Portuguese founded the city of Bissau on land that had belonged to the Papei people. The new colonial city grew into one of Portugal’s primary slave ports, which led to a massive stone fort being built there in 1753 to solidify Portuguese control of the city. When the international slave trade was outlawed in the 1830s, the city of Bissau began to decline. That is, until 1941 when the capital of Portuguese Guinea was moved from Bolama to Bissau. In the 1950s, Guinea-Bissau, like many African nations at the time, began organizing for independence from the Portuguese colonizers. In 1956, the poet, agricultural engineer, revolutionary, and diplomat Amílcar Cabral established the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). At its outset, the group’s mission was to achieve independence through non-violent means. One of PAIGC’s first major acts was to help organize a peaceful strike for better salaries at the Pidjiguiti Docks of the Port of Bissau. On August 3, 1959, sailors and dockworkers halted all operations at the port. Soon after, a colonial police force, the International and State Defense Police (PIDE), was called in to remove the strikers and regain control of the port. When PIDE broke through the port’s locked gate, they opened fire on the large crowd of strikers, killing 50 people and injuring hundreds. They also arrested and tortured numerous strikers. For Cabral, the episode demonstrated that independence wouldn’t be achieved through peaceful means. A little over a month later, on September 19, 1956, PAIGC declared a fight for independence “by all possible means, including war.” For more than a decade, Cabral led PAIGC’s guerrilla movement against the Portuguese colonial government until independence was finally achieved in 1974. The Hand of Timba monument commemorates the dockworkers who were among the first to lose their lives in Guinea-Bissau’s war for independence. The clenched hand represents a swindler, someone who does intend to pay their debts—in this case, Portuguese colonizers who refused to pay dockworkers fair wages. Two other monuments nearby also commemorate the event: an anchor inscribed with the names of fallen dockworkers and a newly installed bust of Amílcar Cabral. The anniversary of the Pidjiguiti Massacre, August 3rd, is a national holiday in Guinea-Bissau.  The Hand of Timba monument is in Praça dos Martires off of Avenida do 3 de Agosto between Avenida Amilcar Cabral and Avenida Domingos Ramos."
1,Presidential Palace,"Bissau, Guinea-Bissau","Built by Portuguese colonizers, the palace is now the seat of power for the independent nation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/presidential-palace-guinea-bissau,"Located in the heart of the capital city of Bissau, the pink-hued Presidential Palace has borne witness to much of the country’s history. Portuguese colonizers originally built the palace. At the time, it was one of the largest buildings in Bissau. But since Guinea-Bissau gained independence in 1974, the palace has been the home of the country’s sitting president. [Delete: When it was built, the palace was one of the largest buildings in Bissau. It long stood as a symbol of Portuguese oppression, but was remade into a symbol of independence after 1974.] During the 1998-1999 Guinea-Bissau Civil War, the palace was bombed and fell into disarray for more than a decade. A colony of bats moved into the palace shell. In 2013, the Chinese government helped to fund the restoration of the palace putting a total of $8 million into the project. The palace reopened in 2015. At the ceremony, Prime Minister Rui Duarte Barros said, “China is the only partner which does not demand anything in return when it finances construction projects in our country. It’s a key partner.” China has also helped to fund other building projects in the country, including a courthouse, the parliament building, and a 20,000 seat stadium. In addition to being the president’s home, the palace is also used for government cabinet meetings.  The palace’s security is wary of people taking close-up photos of the building."
2,Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro,"Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast",The world's largest church atop a political fault line.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yamoussoukro,"In a country known best for civil war and political unrest, the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace emerges tranquilly from the barren landscape surrounding the church on all sides. Despite its impressive stature, it remains shrouded in controversy from comparison and stands as a symbol of the problems facing the Ivory Coast. Construction began on the Basilica in 1985, just 25 years into the Ivory Coast’s remarkable and prosperous independent history. The Ivory Coast’s beloved leader Felix Houphouet-Boigny chose the location on the outskirts of Yamoussoukro. Houphouet-Boigny grew up in the city and led the country into stability since its independence in 1960. After the complex was finished in 1990, the basilica, which is modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, had cost over $300 million, and stood as the world’s largest church eclipsing the size of its inspiration in Italy. The complex is over 30,000 square meters and the dome rises over 500 feet into the air and can accommodate 18,000 worshippers. Although the Basilica gave the Ivory Coast international recognition, including Pope John Paul II’s blessing, its construction symbolized a larger problem that would plague the country over the next 20 years. In the vein of a monarchical France, the Basilica was in essence a statement of grandeur more fitting for Louis XIV’s riches than a prosperous but nascent democratic economy. Unlike St. Peters, the basilica is built on the outskirts of the city and is surrounded by marked poverty, dotting a barren and dusty landscape. By comparison to its surroundings, the Basilica loses its imposing beauty quickly. Less than a decade after its construction, the Ivory Coast was plunged into a series of civil wars, the most recent of which exploded between November 2010-April 2011 after failed elections in 2010. As Houphouet-Boigny quickly worked to build a lasting symbol of political tranquility in the twilight of his time in office, it became evident that stability was fleeting. Just as the newly independent government had stood as a symbol of hope in a struggling West African region of the 1970s and 1980s, the Basilica now stands as precarious hope and stability in a struggling Ivory Coast. Despite its renown and massive size, the basilica like its country, sits atop a political fault line, willing to devour it into the earth at the tiniest shake. As poor vendors peruse its borders selling cheap wares, the structure constantly begs the question of whether a permanent reminder of stability was too much too soon."
3,Crocodile House,"Abidjan, Ivory Coast",Living inside a fearsome reptile in the Ivory Coast.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crocodile-house,"Thierry Atta is now fully moved into his new home. Situated in the midst of Abidjan, the former capital of the Ivory Coast, the architect’s home is actually a massive and grotesquely-smiling crocodile, completely hollowed out to create a living space inside of the reptile structure. Completed in 2008, the crocodile was actually the work of artist Moussa Kalo, who sadly died only two months before it was completed. As an apprentice of Kalo, Atta moved into the work the men had created, and has since made the crocodile his home. Including windows and a bed, the strange concrete house is completely livable, and is a joy to many people in the neighborhood who stop by the courtyard to smile and play by the eccentric home."
4,Gedi Ruins,"Malindi, Kenya",Abandoned city hidden from the world by tropical forest and isolation on the coast of Kenya.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gedi-ruins,"The Gedi ruins are one of Kenya’s great mysteries. Set in an idyllic location on the Indian Ocean, and buried deep in a lush forest, the town was thought to have been founded in the early 13th-century, although hard evidence eludes most scientists. But what has really baffled researchers is the well-established town’s mysterious abandonment and incredible development. Left standing today are numerous coral-brick houses, a palace as well as an impressive mosque. However, it is not only the quality of the ruins that amazes visitors but the advanced nature of the settlement. Gedi was in many ways, a very advanced city with streets, running water and flushing toilets. Correcting the assumption that Africa was far behind the rest of the world before colonialism, Gedi was a cosmopolitan urban setting, and archeologists have found Ming Chinese vases, Venetian glass as well as other artifacts from all over the world. This potpourri of history is clear evidence that the Muslim inhabitants of the coastal Kenyan town traded heavily with cultures outside their own, and developed an incredible world that has now been deeply decomposed by tropical forests. Excavation has occurred since 1948, and the entire area is protected as a national park in Kenya. Head north from Mombasa towards Malindi, Gedi is 65 miles north of Mombasa and about 10 miles south of Malindi."
5,Giraffe Manor,"Nairobi, Kenya","Just outside of Nairobi lies a large estate surrounded by endangered Rothschild giraffes, who have been fed from the window by Mick Jagger and Walter Cronkite.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/giraffe-manor,"The Rothschild Giraffe is one of the most endangered giraffe subspecies in the entire world. They have gone extinct in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo and only remain in Kenya and Uganda, where their numbers are quite scarce. To try to combat this problem, the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife founded the Giraffe Center in 1979 with the intention of breeding Rothschild Giraffes on a 140 acre plot of land. Their attempt to increase the population of the giraffes and return them to national parks was a success. Since then they have been focusing on educating Kenyan youth about the importance of conservation. The founders of the Giraffe Center also needed a place to live, and there happened to be an ivy-covered, brick mansion located right in the middle of the breeding grounds. After residing there for a few years, the founders came up with a brilliant idea: turning the mansion into a luxurious 10-room hotel called “Giraffe Manor.” It couldn’t have been a better idea. Nowadays, Giraffe Manor is one of the most iconic and unique hotels in the world. Every morning, the giraffes from the Giraffe Center walk from their natural habitat to the windows of the Giraffe Manor to eat breakfast with the guests. Seriously. They either crane their necks down to reach the lower rooms or they stretch their necks up to reach the windows of the upper floor. They slurp up whatever is on the plate, with their faces right next to those the hotel guests. Since they have unrestricted roaming rights, this is purely by choice. When they’re done eating, they maneuver their heads out of the giant windows of Giraffe Manor and continue on with their normal lives."
6,Nairobi Animal Orphanage,"Nairobi, Kenya","Located in Nairobi National Park, this animal orphanage is the oldest of its kind in Kenya.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nairobi-animal-orphanage,"Founded in 1964, the Nairobi Animal Orphanage houses and treats over 20 animal and bird species in need of rehabilitation after injury or abandonment. Lions, cheetahs, jackals, hyenas, ostriches, parrots, and more inhabit the orphanage, which welcomes over 200,000 visitors each year. The Nairobi Animal Orphanage is both a conservation facility for animals in need and an educational resource for the public—mainly school children who wouldn’t otherwise have an opportunity to see these animals in the wild. While it’s far from the majesty of seeing these creatures healthy in their natural habitats, each of the animals in the Nairobi Animal Orphanage has been taken in by park rangers to receive medical treatment before being placed in an individualized rehabilitation program for a second chance at life. The goal of the orphanage is to strengthen the animals so they may eventually be released back into the wild. The Nairobi Animal Orphanage is located just inside Nairobi National Park just 20 minutes from the center of Nairobi—billed by African Spice Safaris as the world’s only city which doubles as a safari capital for unbridled wildlife sightings. Day tours of the orphanage are available for booking.  The Nairobi Animal Orphanage is open seven days a week from 8am to 5pm."
7,Ali Barbour's Cave Restaurant,"Diani Beach, Kenya","Drink and dine in a coral cave that's at least 120,000 years old.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ali-barbours-cave-restaurant,"Visitors flock to Kenya’s Diani Beach for the white sands and ritzy resorts, but the setting sun reveals the splendor of another local gem, Ali Barbour’s Cave Restaurant. Diners enter through an unassuming, whitewashed facade, then descend 33 feet underground to enjoy their meals in an ancient coral cave with a wide mouth overhead for excellent stargazing. Located in a cave thought to be between 120,000 and 180,000 years old, Ali Barbour’s takes dining al fresco to a whole other dimension. In the evenings, the restaurant glows in the muted light of candles, and diners’ eyes are naturally drawn to the twinkling stars above. (Sliding covers are drawn to create a makeshift roof in inclement weather.) Founded by George and Jackie Barbour in the 1980s and named as a play on “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,” the restaurant is designed to keep the natural elements of the cave intact, with only the kitchen and bathrooms modified for modern uses. Though the menu is international, seafood is the specialty. You can dine on a meal caught in the Indian Ocean, mere feet from your table, and possibly at the same sea level.  The restaurant opens daily at 6:30 p.m. and has a ""smart/casual"" dress code (i.e., no beachwear). Reservations are recommended."
8,Giraffe Centre,"Nairobi, Kenya",Get tall with nature's lankiest beasts and their warthog friends at this Kenyan preserve.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/giraffe-centre,"Like the short-haired brontosauri of the modern day, giraffes are almost hilariously tall, and certainly don’t seem like the type of creatures one could feed snacks to, but at Kenya’s Giraffe Centre getting face-to-face with the gentle giant is the order of the day. The centre was opened in 1983, but its track record of preservation goes back years earlier. The project that would grow into the Giraffe Centre first began in 1979 by Jock and Betty Leslie-Manville who set out to save the nearly extinct Rothschild giraffe. The couple’s project began when they captured a baby giraffe and set out to establish a breeding program to repopulate the spotted creatures. The Leslie-Manville’s started to raise giraffes right on their own property, and soon the centre was born with the addition of a private education center. The repopulation project took off and the centre was able to reintroduce fertile giraffe couples to a number of Kenyan national parks. Of course they still kept a number of the animals at their center. The Giraffe Centre opened to the public in the early eighties and is now simply part of a larger non-profit organization, the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife (Kenya) Ltd. Visitors can come to the centre and actually get right up into the faces of the giraffes via raised walkways. The animals can be fed little snack pellets and might even reciprocate with a lick with their big purple tongues. Adorable and gross. A number of warthogs also roam the grounds."
9,Kitum Cave,Kenya,A salty cave excavated by elephants and the location of a deadly disease vector.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kitum-cave,"When the Kitum Cave was first discovered, the many marks, scratches, and furrows along its walls were assumed to have been the work of picks wielded by ancient Egyptians searching for gold or diamonds. In fact, the excavated sections of the cave are the result of something much more unusual. The cave is found on Mount Elgon, an extinct shield volcano, and it developed as the result of cooling volcanic rock. The cave, which extends some 600 feet into the mountain, has walls that are rich in salt, and it is here that the mysterious cave diggers reveal themselves. Each night for hundreds (possibly thousands) of years, animals have traveled into the cave in the dead of night to use it as a giant salt lick. Buffaloes, antelope, leopards, hyenas, and most of all elephants bumble blindly through the cave (the elephants often bump their heads in the process), making their way to the salty walls of the cave. It is the elephants that have done the digging. Using their massive tusks, the elephants pull off chunks of the walls to crush and lick up the salt. Over the centuries this has resulted in a noticeable increase in the size of the cave as well as walls that are covered in tusk marks. The trip to the depths of the cave is not without its dangers; there is a deep crevasse into which many younger, more inexperienced elephants have fallen, leaving behind an elephant graveyard. The Kitum Cave is more recently famous for a very different sort of lifeform: a deadly virus. In 1980 and again in 1987, visitors to the cave contracted Marburg virus, a deadly virus similar to Ebola. The cave and Marburg virus rose to notoriety when they were featured in the 1994 bestseller The Hot Zone. It is believed that bats in the cave are carriers of the virus, and that their powdered guano may act as the disease vector."
10,Marafa Depression,"Malindi, Kenya","Strange sandstone canyon known as the ""place broken by itself.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marafa-depression,"The Marafa Depression, also known as Hell’s Kitchen, is an odd sandstone canyon outside of Malindi, Kenya. Known locally as Nyari - “the place broken by itself” - it was once a great sandstone ridge worn by wind, rain, and floods into a series of jagged gorges. The layer-cake colors of the sandstone reveal whites, pinks, oranges, and deep crimsons, making the gorge particularly striking at sundown, when tones of the ribbed sandstone gullies are highlighted and mirrored by those of the setting sun. Naturally, local stories accompany the “place broken by itself.” According to legend, there was once a town located where the gorge is now. One day, all the town’s inhabitants received a vision telling them a miracle was coming and to move their town. Everyone moved except one old woman who refused to leave. The abandoned town then supposedly vanished - with the remaining woman still inside - leaving the Marafa Depression in its place."
11,Mara River Crossing,Kenya,Life and death are on parade at the most reliably perilous site of “the Great Migration.”,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mara-river-crossing,"One of Earth’s most spectacular wildlife events takes place each year in the heart of eastern Africa, culminating at a river crossing where nature coldly decides who lives to see another season. Dubbed “The Great Migration,” 1.5 million wildebeest, zebras, and gazelle follow a circular migratory route throughout the Serengeti and Maasai Mara ecosystems, fraught with a series of river passages whose raging currents and predatory beasts lurking in the shallows make the endeavor more than just a simple swim. After having forded the formidable Grumeti River in Tanzania, the remaining herd makes its way north from July through October to meandering Mara River. Along its banks, the wildebeest queue up as far as they eye can see, waiting to take the season’s final plunge in hopes of finding promise greener grasses – and, new studies show, better drinking water – on the other side. Before they can get there, throngs of hungry crocodiles lie in wait. For the wildebeest, getting to the other side alive is a lot like a very dangerous, inescapable game of roulette. Carcasses of those who didn’t make it litter the Mara’s banks. Vultures feast on what the crocodiles left behind. Immortalized by Attenborough, such scenes of Nature ruthlessly sorting animals into those who live and those who die has become at once inspiring and macabre. No wonder the Mara crossing has become the kind of place travelers wait lifetime to visit in person. It is the world’s most quintessential struggle, played out in realtime, before one’s eyes… and among few places on the planet where it can be witnessed reliably, year after year. The timing of the migration varies slightly form year to year depending on the rains, however the migration is usually in the Mara from late July to early October, and July/August is the peak time when most of the animals are in the Mara. If you want to see the migration at other times of year, you will need to go to Tanzania to see then in the Serengeti.If you are keen to see a river crossing then you will need to be careful when booking your lodge, as many places are 2-3 hours from the river crossings. The further away you are from the river, the more of your game drive will be taking up by travelling...or example, if you stay at a lodge 3 hours from the river you will need to spend 6 hours just driving to and from the river from your accommodation. Lodges nearer the river are more expensive, however you will have a much better chance of seeing a river crossing as you can spend longer at the river."
12,Kitengela,"Nairobi, Kenya",A glass and sculpture wonderland forms an oasis in a remote part of Kenya.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kitengela,"When German art brut exponent Nani Croze settled in the desert across the road from Nairobi National Park in the 1970s, she had no reprieve from the scorching Kenyan sun. There were few trees, so the artist began making sculptures to create shade. “[It] started as a pioneer homestead and grew into an oasis,” Croze has said. Now, the Kitengela settlement is a community, a glassworks, a hotel, and a sculpture garden that’s something like a cross between the splendorous architecture of Antoni Gaudí and a Hobbit village. The settlement is a wonderland with hidden works of art around every corner. The sculptures depict a fantastical world filled with dragons, butterflies and abstract, multicolored giants. In spite of the fact that every staircase and windowsill has been painted and molded to the artists’ satisfaction, Kitengela appears to have grown organically out of the earth. Kitengela’s purpose is to improve the community. Its most obvious contribution is aesthetic beauty, but it also gives back in more tangible ways. Croze has partnered with hospitals and charities, giving away her own work and lessons. The materials used in Kitengela’s sculptures is all found and recycled, and they are as likely to be built by creative locals as by professional artists. Croze also hosts workshops and apprenticeships at Kitengela, some geared specifically for women to learn the art of glassmaking and mosaic. Kitengela has turned into a sort of commune—the studio on the property employs about 50 people, many of whom live there with their families as well. Visitors are also welcome to stay at Kitengela. Croze has several cottages available for short-term rentals, but be warned: None are free of animal life. Kitengela has its own pigs, ducks, and geese, but given that the community is adjacent to a national park, baboons, giraffes, and ostriches are just as commonly seen."
13,Carnivore Restaurant,"Nairobi, Kenya","Kenyan restaurant is a carnivore's paradise, serving exotic meats at its ultimate 'Beast of a Feast.'",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/carnivore-restaurant-nairobi,"Hidden within a tropical garden and adorned with a loud, colorful décor, The Carnivore opens up into a vegetarian’s fiery nightmare, or a meat eaters Shangri-la, depending on your culinary leanings. Twice making the world’s 50 best restaurants by Restaurant Magazine, Carnivore opened in 1980 to immediate popularity. Borrowing aesthetic from medieval banquet halls, the decor is indoor/outdoor with tropical plants and streams weaving around tables. A giant roasting pit resides near the entrance of the building, covered in traditional Maasai swords ladened with hunks of meaty goodness from just about every animal you can think of that’s not on the endangered species list. Constantly being turned and basted over the pit are selections of the likely suspects at any BBQ–chicken wings, spare ribs, lamb, and different cuts of pork and beef. For the more adventurous there are bolder choices, such as camel, crocodile, tasty kidney morsels, and mutura, a local sausage consisting of cow or goat meat, tripe, and cooled blood seasoned with onions, salt, pepper, and chili. After being seated and served some gratuitous soup and bread and introduced to a double-decker revolving tray of exotic sauces, the diners are then inundated with servers carrying the meat-encumbered Maasai swords, offering the succulent outside cut of whatever strikes the customers fancy. Truly a practice in excess, visitors are encouraged to continue shoving food down their gullets until they can take no more, signaling their surrender by lowering a white flag provided for them in the center of the table. When the servers have been alerted to their victory, they will then bring around desert and coffee to those who are up to the challenge. Besides the meat orgy, Carnivore also has a nightclub, gardens, a playground for children, signature cocktails, an events area, an African heritage gallery, and believe it or not, a vegetarian menu.

14,Bomas of Kenya,"Nairobi, Kenya",This tourist village in Nairobi celebrates the traditional lifestyles and customs of Kenyan tribes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bomas-of-kenya,"Billed as “Kenya in miniature,” Bomas of Kenya is a tourist village and cultural center six miles outside of Nairobi. It features replicas of traditional homesteads, or bomas, from 23 of Kenya’s ethnic groups, as well as traditional dances performed in its large auditorium. Bomas of Kenya was founded by the Kenya Tourist Development Cooperation in 1971. It was conceived and planned by Barack Obama Sr., although you won’t find any mention of him on the official website. Despite being the driving force behind the project, Obama Sr. was fired in controversial circumstances, his superiors unhappy at what they saw as his overuse of unilateral decision making. Despite the acrimonious beginning, the center went on to become a successful celebration of more than 40 ethnic groups in Kenya. The name of the tourist village comes from the Swahili word boma, meaning homestead, referring to the 23 replica villages found on the site, each displaying the unique characteristics of their respective ethnic group. At first glance, these round huts all appear much the same. But on further inspection, important and distinct social structures emerge. The organization of the various homesteads reveals telling details about the particular ethnic group. For example, the planning of homesteads in polygamous groups reflects this distinct hierarchy (first wife’s hut, second wife’s hut etc.). In other homesteads, the size and distribution of granaries reveals the responsibilities and importance of particular family members. Different construction methods, and forms of partitioning and decorations within homes, also vary between groups, highlighting important cultural differences. Along with the homesteads, one other key structure at Bomas of Kenya is the 3,000-capacity auditorium, one of the largest of its kind in Africa. Build in the shape of an African hut, the auditorium hosts daily song and dance performances from many of Kenya’s ethnic groups. These represent a diverse tribal cultural spectrum, and include everything from Kalenjin warrior dances to Swahili taarab music and Kikuyu circumcision ceremonies (minus the actual circumcision). Completing the cultural showcase is the Utamaduni Restaurant, where traditional Kenyan gastronomy is celebrated with dishes from various parts of the country.  Bomas of Kenya is located about six miles from Nairobi’s city center, and not far from the main entrance to Nairobi National Park. The bomas (homesteads) are open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Performances take place Monday to Friday from 2:30 p.m. to 4 p.m., and 3:30 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. on weekends and during public holidays. The entrance fee is 1,000 Kenyan shillings for non-residents, which is about $10 US."
15,Fort Jesus,"Mombasa, Kenya",This colonial fort is an intriguing example of Renaissance military architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fort-jesus,"The structure of Fort Jesus resembles the shape of a human body, with the head pointing toward the sea. The structure is an interesting blend of colonial and indigenous techniques. It’s a showcase of Renaissance military architecture built with locally available coral stone and lime mortar worked on using local techniques. Fort Jesus was completed in 1596. It was commissioned by King Philip I of Portugal and designed by renowned architect Giovanni Battista Cairati In the subsequent 300 years, the fort changed hands at least 10 times, with the Portuguese, Swahilis, Omani Arabs, and eventually British vying to own it. Possession of this strategic fort indicated the power a given government had in controlling trade over the Indian Ocean. The original walls, which were designed to withstand cannon balls, used to be nearly 50 feet (15 meters) high, and the Omanis increased their height by nine feet. Eventually, the walls were used to not only keep invaders out, but to keep people in as well. The British converted the fort into a prison in 1895, and it served this purpose until 1958, when it was declared a national monument. And in 2011, the fort became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The fort in its current form is an amalgamation of European, African, and Middle-Eastern building styles, which blend seamlessly. The ramparts offer an expansive view of the Port of Mombasa. The rooms of the fort now house a museum shedding light to the history of the fort and Mombasa.  The museum is open daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. You can find a map of its various exhibits here."
16,Donkeys of Lamu Island,"Lamu, Kenya","Kenya’s oldest town is more than 700 years old and home to 6,000 donkeys.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/donkeys-of-lamu-island,"Off the northern coast of Kenya, close to the border with Somalia, sits Lamu Island. Founded in 1370, it is the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in the country, and has largely remained unchanged over the centuries. The streets are narrow—often no more than two shoulder lengths in width—meaning that traversing the island by car is impossible. Instead, there are donkeys—more than 6,000 of them, used for transporting goods and people through the town. So important are these animals that the largest nonprofit on the island is a donkey sanctuary and one of the two cars on the island is an ambulance for donkeys. Each year the Lamu Cultural Festival celebrates the animals with a donkey race down the island’s beaches. Crowds of thousands gather to watch the local donkey jockeys compete head to head for the title. Strategically located along ancient trade routes between the Middle East and South Asia, Lamu Island was once the most important trade hub in the region. It is one of the clearest example of Swahili architecture—a fusion of South Asian, the Middle Eastern, and the East African styles—where ornately carved wooden doors are the gateways into multigenerational family homes made of local coral stone."
17,Lake Turkana,Kenya,The world’s largest permanent desert lake is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-turkana,"Lake Turkana, Africa’s fourth largest and most saline lake, is a desolate wonder located in the arid desert region of the Kenyan Rift Valley, piercing the border of Ethiopia at its northernmost end. Also referred to as Lake Rudolf after European visitors named the lake after a 19th century Austrian prince, and Jade Lake for the verdant color of the water, Lake Turkana is a vast but shallow body of water that stretches over 150 miles long and up to 20 miles wide. The lake is an imperative resource for peoples in the surrounding desert region, migratory birds including flamingos, cormorants, and kingfishers, and local wildlife like the Nile Crocodile, hippos, and fish such as Nile perch, tigerfish, and tilapia. Lake Turkana and its islands were designated national parks in the 1970s and 80s. In 1997, Lake Turkana National Parks were collectively made a UNESCO World Heritage Site for the region’s extraordinary biodiversity. While UNESCO status requires the lake’s protection, Lake Turkana has since been placed on the World Heritage “In Danger” list for poor conservation practices and overdevelopment.  Visitors can reach Lake Turkana by car, boat, and public bus. The region is strictly accessible by 4-wheel drive vehicles only, and muddy roads make for difficult driving conditions during the rainy season. It’s recommended that visitors who choose to drive don’t venture solo in case of a breakdown in this remote area. The eastern side of Lake Turkana is slightly more populated, but supply stations are few and it’s suggested that travelers bring extra gas, drinking water, and camping supplies. Daily buses provide transportation between towns. Schedules are typically unreliable, but several bus companies offer routes within the region. Those who wish to cross the lake by boat must hire a private boat far in advance. Lake journeys are only possible in fair weather conditions. It is not advised to go swimming in Lake Turkana as the lake is home to saltwater crocodiles, including the Nile Crocodile."
18,Nairobi Railway Museum,"Nairobi, Kenya",Strolling through these vintage locomotives offers a surprising amount of insight into the history of Kenya.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nairobi-railway-museum,"The construction of the so-called “lunatic line,” or Uganda Railway, began in 1896 from Mombasa on the Kenyan coast and finally reached Kisumu on the eastern shore of Lake Victoria in 1901, costing an estimated four lives for every mile of track laid along the way—including some deaths infamously caused by a pair of man-eating lions on the Tsavo plains. Today, in the centre of Kenya’s capital city, the Nairobi Railway Museum is dedicated to the history of the country’s rail network. There you’ll find an intriguing jumble of artifacts plus a variety of exhibits and ephemera that illustrate the construction and running of the railway. There are models of railway engines that operated on the line, photographs of the railway throughout its history, and a varied selection of other oddities, including an interesting motorized railway bicycle. In the surrounding yard are a number of mostly steam and some early diesel locomotives which operated as part of what was initially the Kenya-Uganda Railway, then the East Africa Railway Company and currently the Kenyan Railways Corporation. The most impressive are some of the company’s old “Garratts,” a particularly large articulated steam engine that was capable of hauling heavy loads over the long distances and steep inclines of the narrow gauge track. The museum is connected by track to the main Nairobi station and some of the engines are reportedly used for excursions. Wandering on and around the locomotives makes for a lovely outing and gives you a surprising amount of insight into the nation’s development. The museum itself is almost a time capsule within a time capsule—a well preserved effort from the post-independence days of the 1970s to conserve an emblematic part of its colonial past. Fitting then is the location of the museum, tucked away amid the modern skyscrapers of the central business district. The rising buildings are a constant reminder that all these days are past, a fact further underlined by the ongoing replacement of the obsolete track laid in the 1800s.  The museum is located in the centre of Nairobi near the railway station and is open daily from 9am-5pm. For those visiting and not well acquainted with Nairobi it would be advisable to take a taxicab to the museum and ask the driver to wait or call them when you are finished. The entrance fee for non-Kenyan residents is currently 600 Kenyan Shillings."
19,Karen Blixen Museum,"Nairobi, Kenya","The farmhouse owned by the Danish author who wrote ""Out of Africa"" is now a museum honoring her legacy.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/karen-blixen-museum,"Some 6 miles outside the center of Nairobi, the Karen Blixen Museum is located in a century-old farmhouse on 6,000 acres of land at the foot of Kenya’s Ngong Hills. The farm was once owned by the Swedish Baron Bror von Blixen Fincke and his wife, Baroness Karen Blixen, who gained significant prominence for her 1937 memoir, “Out of Africa.” The couple bought the property in 1917 and lived in the farmhouse until 1921, when Karen Blixen became the sole owner of the home following the end of her marriage. Blixen fell in love with an English game hunter named Denys Finch Hatton, who died in a plane crash in 1931. The tragedy prompted Blixen to return to Denmark that same year, and the farmhouse passed through several successive owners. In 1964, the Danish government purchased Blixen’s former farmhouse house and gifted it to Kenya as a token of the country’s newly gained independence from Britain. The house appeared in the film adaptation of Out of Africa in 1985, after which the National Museums of Kenya acquired the property to convert the house into a museum. The Karen Blixen Museum opened in 1986 in honor of Blixen’s life and work at her beloved residence “in Africa at the foot of the Ngong Hills,” as she so famously wrote.  The Karen Blixen Museum is open seven days a week from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Visitors are suggested to arrive no later than 5:30 p.m. Guided tours are offered daily."
20,Ha Kome Cave Dwellings,Lesotho,An 18th-century hideout became a permanent and ongoing residence for one Lesotho tribe.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ha-kome-cave-dwellings,"The cliff overhangs of Ha Kome are a series of cave dwellings an hour’s drive from Maseru, the capital of Lesotho. While their exact history is unknown, the current inhabitants are descended from Basia tribesmen and women who first made the overhang home in the late 1800s. The Mefcane (“the Crushing”) was a period of intense socio-political unrest during the 1820s and 30s throughout southern Africa, defined by widespread drought, forced migration, and inter-tribal warfare. To flee the ongoing violence, the Basia began using the overhang as a hideout at some point in the late 1800s, though trademark cave paintings indicate San Bushmen dwelt here even earlier. In time, the Basia came to build homes out of mud, which have been continuously occupied since then. Today, several families who live in these dwellings welcome visitors into their homes.  Ha Kome is easy enough to find using Google Maps, but you'll need a vehicle with a high clearance to make it down the dirt road.  Stop in at the Visitor's Center, and a friendly guide will hop in to show you the way."
21,Masitise Cave House Museum,"Quthing, Lesotho",This odd little home was built right into an African rock face.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/masitise-cave-house-museum,"Built directly into the rock, the Masitise Cave House Museum is the former private home of Revered David-Frederic Ellenberger, a Swiss missionary. Ellenberger created the small residence in 1867 after he and his family were forced further South by the Basotho-Boar War. Ellenberger found a well-known cave in the rocky mountains of Lesotho and decided it was the perfect spot to found his new church, and bring God to the people of the country. The missionary built a brick edifice on to the opening of the cave and spent 55 years ministering to the peoples of the area. The cave had previously been used as a shelter for the local tribes, but soon became a beacon of Christianity. In addition to its half-natural construction the cave house also had a handful of other features. There is a dinosaur track in the ceiling and it is said that Ellenberger’s son is entombed in the wall. The home is now a small museum holding an eclectic group of objects, including family photos, traditional clothing, taxidermied animals, and of course a dinosaur footprint in the ceiling. The Cave House is about 5 kilometers west of Quthing. You have to turn onto the road for the Masitise Primary School. Before you reach the school, follow the road to the right. You'll reach a small cluster of buildings and someone there can open the Cave House for you."
22,Ha Baroana Cave Paintings,"Metolong, Lesotho","The walls of this sandstone outcropping are covered with 2,000-year-old artwork.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ha-baroana-cave-paintings,"Deep in the cradle of civilization, you can still find traces of our ancient ancestors. Lesotho’s amazing Ha Baroana site is only an hour’s drive from the capital of Maseru, and on the far side of the Liphiring River, tucked inconspicuously beneath a black-and-tan cave, sit a remarkably preserved stretch of paintings. The walls of Ha Baroana, which translates as “home of the bushmen,” are decorated with paintings of animals like leopards, lions, antelope, cranes, and guinea fowls, as well as paintings of people hunting and dancing. It has been estimated that the paintings were made about 2,000 years ago by the San people, a group of hunter-gatherers who have inhabited southern Africa for thousands of years, long before the arrival of Bantu-speaking nations. Though the paintings are faded from years of exposure to the elements, it’s still possible to make out a series of hunting scenes, a sight that is sure to give even the most jaded wanderer chills.  It's best to take a local guide with a 4x4, as the last several kilometers of the trip call for crossing a series of working pastures.  Although the steep, scenic hike down into the river valley will be almost as impressive as the paintings themselves, the path isn't suitable for anyone for mobility issues, and can be downright treacherous during the rainy summer season."
23,Lion Rock Mountain,"Maseru, Lesotho","Just outside Lesotho's capital city, a rock formation takes the shape of a powerful predator.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lion-rock-mountain,"Less than a 30-minute drive from the heart of Maseru stands one of the most unique rock formations in the world. Lion Rock Mountain might only rise a few hundred meters above the horizon, but it still somehow manages to create an amazing landscape, something straight out of The Lion King. If you’re headed away from the capital en route to Lesotho’s more remote attractions, a quick stop here is sure to fill you with wonder and inspiration.  Without any tourism infrastructure, there’s nothing more to do at Lion Rock Mountain than just stop and admire the formation.  The best views are from the parking lot of nearby Leqele High School, where the staff and students have grown accustomed to seeing groups of tourists and wanderers pull in and linger for a few minutes."
24,Subeng River Dinosaur Prints,"Jonathans, Lesotho",Take a step into the Cretaceous Period with these preserved dinosaur tracks.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/subeng-river-dinosaur-prints,"Just over two hours from the city of Maseru, the narrow Subeng River in northern Lesotho has been home to a series of fossilized dinosaur prints for hundreds of millions of years. The reward for wading across the shallow water is a chance to get up close and personal with the tracks of several types of dinos, including the unique three-toed prints of the chicken-sized Lesothosaurus. The fossilized footprints were first identified as dinosaur tracks in 1955. Footprints from at least three species of dinosaurs, possibly more, can be found at this site. In the preserved tracks, you can see that some had five toes on their feet, while others had three. By placing their hands down on the rocks, a visitor can instantly bridge the gap between the Cretaceous and the present.  The Subeng River rises quickly during the rainy summer months, obscuring several varieties of prints altogether.  If possible, it's best to plan your visit during the dry wintertime.  Bring a pair of boots if you have them, or a towel if you plan on going barefoot."

Featuring a full-scale recreation of a traditional village as well as a fascinating museum, this flagship tourist attraction is a must-visit on your first trip to the Mountain Kingdom. A blanket-clad guide is available on request, and their tour will change the way you view this fascinating enclave country. Thaba Bosiu is a sandstone plateau located between the Orange and Caledon Rivers in the Maseru District of Lesotho. It was once the capital of Lesotho, and served as the residence and military stronghold of Moshoeshoe I, the kingdom’s founding father, throughout most of his reign in the mid-19th century. In 1967, Lesotho’s government declared the mountain a national monument.  Thaba Bosiu is just a short drive from Maseru, and the paved road is well-marked.  The center hosts a number of events and special programs, so it's best to call ahead and see what's on."
26,Basotho Hat,"Maseru, Lesotho","Not only does this shop sell mokorotlo, the traditional hat of Lesotho, the building is shaped like one.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/basotho-hat,"The Basotho people comprise 99 percent of Lesotho’s population, so it seems fitting that the remote enclave country’s only official Visitor’s Center was fashioned after their traditional straw hat. The hat has a wide brim and a pointed top, a design that is said to be inspired by the shape of Mount Qiloane. A similar style of hat was worn by Basotho tribal chiefs, who performed a type of song known as mokorotlo at certain ceremonies. In the 1950s and 60s, the hats became popular among the wider population, and were called mokorotlo because of their connection to Basotho identity. It became such an important symbol that when Lesotho gained independence from Great Britain in 1966, it was selected to appear on the country’s new flag. Basotho Hat is a two-story arts and crafts collective that hosts a wide assortment of baskets and weavings, all of which were manufactured throughout the Mountain Kingdom. It’s a great way to support local businesses in a place where the average salary is less than $2 USD per day.  Located just a few kilometers after you cross into the kingdom from South Africa via the busy Maseru Bridge, the Basotho Hat makes a natural first stop for day-trippers and adventure travelers alike. Free on-street parking is available."
27,Abandoned Ducor Hotel,"Monrovia, Liberia","Empty since 1989, now falling into ruin.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-ducor-hotel,"Once operated by Intercontinental Hotels, this hotel was abandoned in 1989 due to political uncertainty just before the coup and first civil war. Due to looting and locals taking up residence in the hotel through the years, the hotel is dilapidated and dangers exist throughout. However, able-bodied individuals should be able to navigate the stairways without too much trouble, and the sight from the rooftop - giving a full panoramic view of Monrovia - easily merits the effort. When the security staff ask you for a “small thing” to enter, just let them know you’re a teacher, Peace Corps volunteer, etc. and they should let you in - and likely escort you through - for two or three dollars."
28,Bomi Blue Lake,"Tubmanburg, Liberia","An abandoned mine pit is now a beautiful, colorful attraction.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bomi-blue-lake,"When the Liberia Mining Company began to abandon its operations in Bomi County in northwestern Liberia, it left behind a series of pit mines. But as nature began to reclaim these scars in the Bomi Hills, one of the pits filled with water, creating a beautiful blue lake. Back in the 1960s and ‘70s, the LMC began operations in the Bomi Hills near the town of Tubmanburg. The company dug a series of huge pits to extract iron ore from the hills, but by the late 1970s, the ore reserves were deemed depleted and the company closed its operations. The LMC left a landscape pockmarked by pits, so much so that locals began to wryly refer to the Bomi Hills as the Bomi Holes. And the mining company had left so quickly that they even abandoned some of their equipment at the bottom of the craters. It was a mess, but one that nature slowly began to reclaim. And as it did so, one of the largest pits took on a whole new life of its own. Despite being stuck up in the hills and isolated from any obvious sources of water, the 300-foot-deep pit began to fill with water, likely fed by a spring somewhere down below. By the end of the 1990s, the lake looked like a totally natural formation. And in 2007, Senator Richard Devine, in whose constituency the lake was situated, began to promote the wonders of what he billed as “a natural phenomenon and …. a wonderful sight to behold.” “One thing is certain about this lake,” continued the Senator, “Whether rain or shine, it never rises above its banks, nor does it dry. The water level is absolutely stable. It’s a wonderful sight, a haven for hotel and casino development, and of course water sports.” Senator Devine’s enthusiasm certainly helped draw attention to the Blue Lake, named for its clear blue waters. But so far, hotels and casinos have yet to set up around the lake. There are a few weathered wooden pavilions, but little else. Still, it’s certainly a pretty spot for a picnic. Despite the lake’s mining history— and the possible presence of mining equipment at its bottom—it was, for a while, the source of bottled Blue Lake mineral water. And it seems that the waters are clean and free from pollution. But before you go for a swim, as many do, you might want to know about certain sightings by  United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) soldiers stationed in the area. These soldiers have apparently spotted some big snakes in the lake, and locals sometimes speak of a particularly large boa living near the waters of the Blue Lake.  Blue Lake, also known as Bomi Lake, is located in the Bomi Hills, about three miles north of the town of Tubmanburg. If you’re feeling fit you could hike up to the lake from Tubmanburg. Otherwise, find someone in town to take you up there in a 4x4 vehicle."
29,Monkey Island,"Marshall, Liberia","After surviving decades of medical testing and civil wars, these chimpanzees were abandoned on their own islands.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monkey-island-liberia,"The year was 1974 and the original Planet of the Apes movie starring Charlton Heston had just been adapted into a small screen series. Little did anyone know, though, that out in the remote jungles of Liberia, a New York non-profit and idealistic young scientist were setting in motion what 30 years later would become what many now call the “real-life planet of the apes.” That non-profit was the New York Blood Center, one of the largest blood banks in the United States. In search of a vaccine for a spate of blood-related diseases, NYBC bankrolled Vilab II, a controversial laboratory led by Betsy Brotman that would go on to conduct medical tests on over 100 chimpanzees. The chimps were injected with various forms of Hepatitis, onchocerciasis (commonly referred to as river blindness), and a host of other maladies. Once they tested positive for one of the diseases, the animals would be transferred to one of six different islands—that, thanks to chimpanzees’ innate physiological inability to swim—were perfect for keeping the infected subjects away from the regular population. Vilab continued its work as Liberia crumbled into civil war, first in 1989 and again in 1999. Eventually, though, the lab encountered a conflict that it could not overcome: growing resistance to animal testing back in the U.S. Eventually, the anti-testing outcry reached the highest levels of the U.S. federal government and the National Institute of Health instituted a moratorium on breeding research chimps and declared that most chimp testing did more harm than good. In 2005, Vilab was shut down for good and all the chimps, approximately 60 or so, were transferred to a series of nearby uninhabited mangrove islands, where they now permanently live. For the next 10 years, NYBC continued to care for the chimps, hiring many of the original lab staff to take food and water to the islands every other day. Then, in March 2015, NYBC suddenly withdrew its financial support, stating they could no longer provide for their former subjects’ well-being. Thankfully, the Humane Society stepped up and decided to assume the responsibility of providing long-term care for the chimps, which costs upwards of $30,000 a month. While her methods eventually fell out of favor, Betsy Brotman and her team’s research did successfully lead to a vaccine for Hepatitis B and a screening method for Hepatitis C. In a 2014 interview, however, Betsy publicly sided with the animal rights activists that eventually caused her lab to close, stating that she no longer believed chimpanzees should be used in experiments.  Do not attempt to visit Monkey Island on your own. The chimps are extremely territorial and are not afraid of making their presence known. If you're intent on visiting, local fishermen can be hired to arrange a boat ride to the island for a negotiated fee."

Built on a foundation of conservationist principles, Libassa Ecolodge endeavors to strike a chord of harmony between visitors and the environment through sustainable practices, education, and mindfulness. A fleet of solar-powered huts comprise the on-site accommodations, which range from the most basic Palaver Hut, a traditional Liberian abode housing a double bed and balcony and constructed with local materials, to the Mangrove Lodge, which hovers over the lagoon with a queen-sized bed, a private pool, and balcony. Regardless of how luxurious your lodgings are, each hut is limited to 200 watts of electricity per room, used only in limited amounts via certified low-energy bulbs and appliances. Water use in each hut is restricted, food is composted, and all paper and plastic products must be recycled. For every tree used to build the huts, at least one new seedling was planted in its stead; and none of the surrounding palm trees were cut down to make way for the resort. On-site recreational activities are equally low-impact and include a small mini golf course, badminton and beach volleyball courts, a ping pong table, diving, snorkeling, bodyboarding, canoeing, horseback riding, and archery. To cultivate awareness of local cultures and the ecosystem, Libassa Ecolodge also offers a restaurant that serves up West African cuisine, the opportunity to partake in African and Latin dance lessons, a tranquil wander through a manicured botanical garden, and an animal sanctuary. The lodge aims to become 100 percent renewable through solar and wind power.  Accommodations can be reserved on Libassa Ecolodge’s website. Visitors should be aware that the road past Kpan's Town near the resort is only drivable by all-terrain vehicle."
31,Liberian National Museum,"Monrovia, Liberia",A comprehensive museum dedicated to Africa's oldest modern republic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/liberian-national-museum,"With two devastating civil wars casting a shadow over its modern image, it’s often forgotten that Liberia was the first African republic to proclaim its independence—a feat it accomplished back in 1847. Even more impressive is the fact that this tiny nation, founded by an upstart group that encouraged free African Americans to migrate to Africa, was able to maintain its sovereignty in the face of intense European colonization, which by the time it was over, left nearly 90 percent of the continent’s total landmass in the hands of foreign powers. These are points of pride for Liberians today—and they are on full display at the Liberian National Museum. The institution is housed in an old executive mansion in downtown Monrovia that was damaged and looted during both civil wars but has been subsequently upgraded and repaired with the assistance of UNESCO. While much of the museum’s collection was carried off by rebels and locals exploiting the chaos of the Second Liberian Civil War, several key artifacts remain, including a 250-year-old dining table that Queen Victoria gave to Joseph Jenkins Roberts, Liberia’s first president. Today, the museum’s ground floor has an impressive collection of musical instruments, masks, and other crafts that provide a strong introduction to the country’s indigenous tribes and traditions, while the second and third floors chronicle the country’s founding, challenges, and successes, including the recent Ebola epidemic.  The museum is open from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. daily except for Sunday, when it is typically closed. Guided tours are available."
32,Robertsport Ghost Ship,"Robertsport, Liberia","After several weeks of radio silence, this abandoned oil tanker washed up on a remote beach in Liberia.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/robertsport-ghost-ship,"In 2016, this mysterious ship bearing the name Tamaya 1 washed up on the shores of Robertsport, Liberia. After the 60-meter-long ship washed ashore, it took government officials several days to realize what had happened, as the Liberian coast is largely unmonitored. Two days later, the government officials learned about the mystery ship on their shores, the Coast Guard boarded the vessel to investigate. The lifeboats were missing and there was no trace of the crew. The Ministry of National Defense put out a statement saying that the bridge was “gutted by fire” and all documents onboard the ship had been burned to a crisp. Theories began to circulate about the cause. The Tamaya was an oil tanker bound for Dakar, Senegal, that had last been seen some three weeks before it washed up on the Robertsport beach. Some suspected the crew and ship had been victims of piracy. That theory was dismissed, as the vessel’s last known position was outside of the waters where pirate groups typically operate. Several months after the incident, the alleged owner, Nigerian national Robert M. Saigba, came to Liberia to meet with government officials. Saigba claimed that the crew was forced to abandon ship to a fishing vessel, leaving behind the Tamaya and their lifeboat. The lifeboat was later found washed up in Edina, Liberia, about 125 miles away.  The ship is a short coastal hike south from Nana's Lodge. Following the coast will get you to the ship, but you will have to either walk across some slippery rocks on the coast or go around them through the forest. The hike is not too difficult but you should take care to wear proper shoes that have grip, not beach sandals."
33,Paynesville Omega Tower,"Paynesville, Liberia",The dead gigantic radio tower of Liberia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paynesville-omega-tower,"For the implementation of the VLF or Very Low Frequency-Navigation System “OMEGA” in 1976, the US Coast Guard erected a 417 meter tall radio tower, which is taller than any man-made object existing today in the European Union! Built near Paynesville in Liberia, it served together with seven other stations as part of a worldwide navigation system, and which could be used to communicate with submerged submarines. While VLF has a very low data transmission rate, one of the advantages of VLF is that, unlike higher frequencies, of say VHF or UHF, it can deeply penetrate seawater to reach submarines. (Frequencies such as VLF and ELF, extremely low frequency, have been cited as the casue behind disoriented and injured whales who communicate using the same wavelengths) However by the 1990s, the global satellite system and GPS made OMEGA obsolete and so OMEGA was shut-off on September 30th, 1997 and the station was given back to the government of Liberia. Unfortunately during this period the government of Liberia was involved in a bloody civil war and had no use for the transmitter and the huge mast, which though it survived the civil war until today, continues to go unused. As there is no access restriction to the mast, it is theoretically possible it could be used for skydiving, powerful transmission experiments and Tesla experiments. For those Tesla experiments however, one ought not forget, that Liberia is a country with a very unreliable electric power supply, so one should come with their own, very large, power generator. Update: The Paynesville tower was demolished in 2011."
34,Acacus Mountains,"Ghat, Libya",Landscape of bizarrely shaped desert mountains and innumerable rock carvings.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/acacus-mountains,"Golden sand dunes cover the ground and cling to the sides of the basaltic mountain range that rises abruptly out of the flat Sahara desert. Forces of nature have always shaped this place, clearly visible in the sand that piles in every rock niche and side canyon of the mountain range, and seemingly embrace the rocks of the terrain. A millennia of desert winds and flashfloods have carved the mountains into bizarre shapes, with innumerable natural arches spanning the foot of the mountains, the largest of which reaches an astonishing height of 150 meters. But it is not the mountains, nor the scenery for which this place is known. Visitors and scientists alike flock to one of Libya’s most remote corners for the numerous pictographs that are found all over the mountains. These images are found seemingly everywhere – at the base of the mountains, under overhanging rocks, in mountain caves, and in the many canyons of the Acacus Mountains. The pictographs depict animals, hunting scenes, and social gatherings. However, they are not merely prehistoric paintings. The date of their origin can roughly be put into four different time periods. The oldest images, from the so-called Wild Fauna Period (12,000 – 6000 BC), were created when the Sahara was covered in a plentiful savannah, with Elephants and Giraffes roaming the wide plains. During this period, carvings depicting those animals were scrawled across the desert cave walls. The Round Head Period (8000 – 6000 BC), named after the images of rather formless bodies in the depictions of humans, forms a transition period between the age of Hunter-Gatherers and the creation of permanent settlements. The Pastoral Period (5500 – 2000 BC) followed, during which the climate of the Sahara grew much more arid. Human figures dominating and taming the forces of nature were painted during this period, including depictions of domesticated cattle and social festivities. Horse and chariot depictions majorly date from the Horse Period (1000 BC – AD 1), during which means of transport made a leap forward, allowing the beginning of large Trans-Continental trade routes in Africa. The final period is called the Camel Period (200 BC – present), during which the Sahara finally became the arid desert that it is today. No single culture or civilization can claim responsibility for the rock art, rather it was most likely a continued tradition among the people of the region, which was set off by the mountains’ earliest inhabitants. The cultures that followed these first settlers, the Tuareg and the Garamantes people, adapted this tradition and created their own images. Over a timespan of 14 millennia, the climate of the region has dramatically changed. Each change, altered the landscape and forced its inhabitants to adapt. The natural forces that have shaped this place are visible in the mountains. The societal changes that followed are visible in the depictions of the rock carvings. Both nature and humans created an astonishing place, in which its history can be read like a book. Reached via 4WD from Ghat or al-Aweinat; Ghat District, Libya"

Covered alleyways and heat reflecting, creme-colored walls weave in and out of grottos and lead to the old town spring water pool. This pre-Saharan city is Ghadames, also known as the ‘pearl of the desert’. While none of the buildings from the protohistoric Berber period or the time of Roman domination still stand, the architectural style distinguishes Ghadames from the surrounding pre-Saharan cities. The houses cluster into a rough circle, the outer walls facing the edges of the city creating a fortified wall around the entire settlement. Inside the walls, the houses utilize different floors for different needs, one for storing goods, another for family living, and the covered alleyways for traveling around the city protected from the blistering desert sun, creating the feel of underground passageways. At the top, open-air terraces are reserved for the women only. Considered the old part of town, new housing has been built outside of the lime-washed walls, however many of the 10,000 residents of this historic oasis return when the heat becomes unbearable, as those walls still provide more relief from the relentless heat than anywhere else."
36,Qasr al-Haj,"Qasr al Hajj, Libya","Fortress-like granary, continually in use for more than nine centuries.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/qasr-al-haj,"Berber architecture is probably one of the most evocative architectural styles in the world. The simplicity of the structures merge with the harsh landscape of the Sahara desert to create a timeless beauty. Some Berber structures in neighbouring Tunisia became world-famous after George Lucas included them in his Star Wars movies. The Qasr al-Haj is arguably the most stunning piece of Berber architecture in Libya. Other than its name suggests (literally translated: Fortress of al-Haj), the structure is neither a fortress, nor a fortified village. The building is a storage facility, created to store the harvests of the semi-nomadic and partly settled people of the region. It is a circular building, featureless from the outside, with a main gate that leads to the large courtyard inside. Surrounding the courtyard are 114 cave-like storage rooms, arranged in several levels. The lowest level, which partially lies underground, is used to store olive oil, while the upper levels are mainly used for barley and wheat. At the side of the main gate, a staircase leads to the top, where a walk completes a full circle around the top of the structure. In a region of limited crops, granaries like this shelter the harvest from animals, thieves and weather extremes. The Qasr al-Haj was built in the 12th century by Sheikh Abu Jatla, who rented the storage rooms to several parties in exchange for a small amount of barley and wheat, which he then distributed among the poor. Since the building is still in use, visitors are encouraged not to enter the storage rooms without the guidance of the caretaker, or the permission from the owners. As of October 2011, it remains unclear, whether the 2011 Libyan Civil War damaged Qasr al-Haj.  Qasr al-Haj, near Zintan, Jebel al-Gharbi District, Libya"

From high above, the volcano is clear to see in the Sahara. It’s surrounded by a smudge of dark basaltic ash and tephra, which extends between six and 12 miles around the central caldera in stark contrast to the surrounding desert. And inside the caldera lie three glinting lakes surrounded by flecks of green. Approaching by foot, visitors to this remote location first walk through the moonscape of the ash and tephra. At the heart of this peculiar landscape is the two-mile-wide, 330-feet-deep caldera, with a 460-feet-high post-caldera scoria cone near its center. Once at the caldera rim, a strange sight awaits: three lakes, and a few smaller bodies of water, lie on the floor of the caldera, surrounded by palms, reeds, and swamp vegetation. Much of the water within the caldera is warm and saline, but some bodies of freshwater do exist. Waw an Namus, therefore, has long been an important stop for caravans traveling across this otherwise parched and isolated part of the Sahara. But Waw an Namus isn’t the most inviting of campgrounds for one particular reason: mosquitoes, and lots of them. The name itself translates to “Crater of Mosquitos,” and visitors are well-advised to camp outside the caldera unless they are well prepared with mosquito nets and a serious supply of repellent. The mosquitoes of Waw an Namus don’t often have the chance to feed on fresh blood, so when they do, they don’t hold back. Questions remain regarding the formation of Waw an Namus. Volcanism in the Sahara isn’t fully understood and various theories exist to explain the presence of volcanoes like Waw an Namus. Its age, too, is open to debate. The central cone looks relatively young, suggesting it may have been formed as recently as a few thousand years ago. The arid climate of the region, however, may be masking the volcano’s true age.  Waw an Namus is located in the Sahara desert of south-central Libya, to the south of the Haruj volcanic field. It lies about 250 miles southeast of the oasis city of Sabha. Due to its remote location and the ongoing Libyan Civil War, few people actually visit Waw an Namus despite its reputation as one of the most beautiful and fascinating natural attractions in the country. Tours can be arranged in the larger cities, but it’s worth doing some thorough research before choosing a company."
38,Gaberoun Oasis,Libya,A deserted Bedouin village lines the shores of this stunning desert oasis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gaberoun-oasis,"This brilliant blue-green gem of a lake, surrounded by golden sand as far as the eye can see, looks like a small pocket of island paradise hidden among the dunes of the Sahara Desert. Palm trees fringe the water, and the ruins of an abandoned village dot one corner of the shore. A Bedouin tribe once lived along the Gaberoun Oasis (also spelled Gabroon, Gabraun, and Gabr Awhn). They fished for saltwater crustaceans, little worm-like creatures that live within the lake. But they couldn’t rely on the lake itself for drinking water, the most precious desert treasure. Instead, they had to dig beneath the sand around its perimeter to search for the same underground springs that feed the trees. The government relocated the entire tribe to a newly built village in the 1980s. The ruins of their old settlement remain, left to bake beneath the scorching sun. A ramshackle tourist camp, complete with a handful of sleeping huts and a small market, keeps a sporadic trickle of human life flowing into the otherwise abandoned oasis. Those who do visit like to swim in the lake; its salinity makes it a pleasant place to float, especially since the surface is strangely chilly. The water’s temperature gets hotter the deeper you dive."
39,Leptis Magna,"Al-Khums, Libya",Magnificent Roman ruins lie vulnerable to destruction on the edge of the Mediterranean.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leptis-magna,"In what is now Libya, Leptis Magna was once the shining star of the Roman Empire. As far as ruins go, the city still stands out as a superior example of Rome’s considerable advances in urban planning and architecture. Despite existing in an unstable nation and sporadically under threat of being caught in the crossfires of civil unrest, it has survived as one of the most complete set of Roman ruins standing. Originally a Phoenician and Berber foundation, the city became part of the grandiose Roman Empire under Tiberius. Under the reign of Lucius Septimius Severus in 193, Leptis peaked as the third greatest city on the entire continent of Roman Africa. Unfortunately, like so many other Roman cities, the vibrant metropolis was doomed by its growth and ingenuity outgrowing its means, and by mid-4th century, the once glorious city by the sea was heavily abandoned, easily sacked by invaders, and in constant threat of destruction due to war and civil unrest. While the ruins still stand regally against the sky, that threat has yet to pass. As recently as 2011, civil war has found its way to Leptis Magna, a ready-made bunker,  attractive as a place to hide weapons, shield military vehicles, and keep backs to the sea. Despite being under UNESCO’s protective wing, its vulnerability to rebels has prompted NATO to make no promises that it will remain off limits from air strikes if intervention is necessary. Currently the site is quiet, and the empty city sleeps."
40,Arch of Marcus Aurelius,"Tarabulus, Libya",This triumphal arch is the only fully standing structure that remains from Roman-era Oea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arch-of-marcus-aurelius,"In the mid-second century, the coastal town of Oea (now modern-day Tripoli in Libya) began an architectural shift to better reflect its recently acquired status as a Roman colonia. Monumental Roman-style structures were erected in what is now Tripoli’s old town, bringing a distinctly Roman identity to a settlement founded by the Phoenicians and ruled by Greeks and Carthaginians before the Romans arrived. Unlike the other two ancient cities of Roman Tripolis—Sabratha and Leptis Magna—Oea has been continuously inhabited. Over the centuries, many of its older buildings have been quarried for material or built over and destroyed, leaving scant traces of the city’s Roman past. The most notable exception is the Arch of Marcus Aurelius, a fascinating triumphal arch that would have been central to the town’s Roman identity. Thanks to a four-line inscription on the arch, we know it was built in honor of Emperor Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. Lucius Verus was the adoptive brother of Marcus Aurelius, and the triumphal arch was erected in large part to commemorate his recent victories over the Parthians. Completed around 165 and built almost entirely from marble, the arch has a rectangular footprint measuring about 41 feet by 32 feet. It is a quadrifrons (or tetrapylon) arch, being of cubic shape with a gate on each of the four sides. The arch was placed in a prominent position near the harbor and at the crossroads leading out to Odea’s neighboring towns. As such, new arrivals, especially important visitors, would have passed through the arch when arriving in Oea. At the time of its construction, the Arch of Marcus Aurelius would have been one of the most elaborately decorated arches in North Africa. It has been heavily eroded over the years, with some parts so damaged that the original features have been lost. But many of the most interesting features can still be identified, especially on the northwest face. Among the decorative acanthus leaves, vines, and grapes etched into the pillars are various figures, including representations of captured barbarians. Among the prisoners are a male with hands bound, a seated woman, and a young boy who seems to be crying. The most important figures, however, are those of the city’s patron deities, Apollo and Minerva. Apollo is represented in a chariot drawn by two griffins, while Minerva, bearing helmet and shield, stands in a chariot pulled by a pair of sphinxes. Four notably empty niches are also embedded within the arch. These likely once held statues of both Emperor Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. Statues have been found in excavations around the fringes of the arch, one of which has been identified as Lucius Verus. In terms of size, it would have fit quite nicely inside one of the now vacant niches.  The Arch of Marcus Aurelius is located along Al Hara Alkabir Street in the Old Town of Tripoli. Tripoli is the capital and largest city of Libya, and is located in the northwest of the country. The arch can be seen at any time of day. Entrance is free."
41,Atiq Mosque,"Ajdabiya, Libya",Early Islamic mosque with several strange conical domes.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atiq-mosque,"Two palm trunks mark the entrance to one of Libya’s most beautiful mosques. The whitewashed mud-brick structure dates from the 7th century, and greeted Muslim pilgrims and caravan routes that crossed this area for a centuries. During the heyday of the Sahara caravan trade routes, the oasis city of Awjilah was an important stop on the way to the Cyrenaican coast, bringing travelers from across the ancient world to the mosque. Nine doors grant access to the house of worship, which lead into a labyrinth of pillars and arches inside, covering an area of more than 400 m². However, the outside of the building is even more remarkable and features 21 snow-white conical beehive domes. The beehives dominate the skyline of the old town of Awjilah, which was lovingly restored in 2006, after the city became one of the most convenient spots to view the solar eclipse of March 2006. As of October 2011 it remains unclear whether the 2011 Libyan Civil War damaged Awjilah, or its ancient mosque.  Awjilah, al-Wahat District, Libya"
42,Wheelus Air Base,"Tripoli, Libya","70 years of foreign military influence on the shores of Tripoli, Libya.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wheelus-air-base,"Between its construction in 1923, and the end of the Cold War in 1991, Wheelus Air Base belonged to five major world powers. Following the base’s ownership neatly parallels world history’s major events, and follows the evolution of power throughout the 20th century. After invading in 1911, Italy took control of Libya as a colony, and opened the air base in 1923. During World War II, another axis power, the Nazis took over the air base as a strategic post in the Mediterranean. As the war turned, the British seized control of the base in 1943, and began a long period of Western influence in Libya. Following the war, Wheelus was handed over to the United States. America immediately jumped on the opportunity to hold a base in a location strategic to North Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Shortly after taking control, there were 5,000 air force troops deployed at the base, and Wheelus became known as “Little America.” While the Americans controlled the base, some Libyan forces were also deployed there, working side by side on their aircraft. One of these men was Muammar Gaddafi, who before instituting his own brand of strict religious rule, was a well-known playboy, who would drink and carouse with the Americans stationed at Wheelus. Unfortunately, Gaddafi’s flirtation with the west ended in 1969, when the Americans were given notice and promptly asked to leave Wheelus Air Base. Strangely enough, after finally gaining power and independence, Gaddafi invited the Soviet Union to Wheelus, where they were stationed until the end of the Cold War. Today, Wheelus Air Base is known as Mitiga International Airport, and is no longer home to any foreign army."
43,Avenue of the Baobabs,"Morondava, Madagascar",The centuries old trees lining both sides of this dirt road may become Madagascar's first natural monument.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/avenue-of-the-baobabs,"The dirt road on the west coast of Madagascar linking Morondava and Belo Tsiribihina is framed by dozens of rare and ancient baobab trees creating a setting so beautiful and unique that it may become the country’s first official natural monument. These giant, dry season-deciduous trees (members of the Mallow family), many of which are more than 800 years old with trunks that are over 150 feet around did not always stand alone. At one time the trees dotting the lane were part of a rich forest of the trees and other plants, but the encroachment of modern civilization and increasing populations in the area led to massive deforestation leaving the remaining baobabs to stand in relative isolation. There are also a handful of the ancient trees remaining in the outlying areas but both the trees along the road otherwise are under near-constant threat of destruction. When Arab seafarers first visited a bit over 1000 years ago, they said the devil ripped them out of the ground and put them back upside down, for their canopies resemble roots. Thankfully, private organizations have taken notice of the site and are now promoting efforts to have the avenue protected, making it the country’s first nationally recognized natural monument, so that the trees might survive for another 800 years to come.  Baobabs are incredibly useful plants, their trunks are harmlessly tapped for water during the dry season and have even been lived in, the young leaves (when reachable) are eaten as a salad vegetable when little else is available, and the nutritious sour brown pulp (tasting somewhat like tamarind) of the hard-shelled fruits is made into a pleasant summertime beverage all over Africa, and is also an ingredient in a Senegalese peanut and couscous dessert pudding called Ngalakh. These trees are popular in novelty gardens around the warmer parts of the Mediterranean and sometimes show up in southern California, they are hardy to plant hardiness zone 10a (minimum of 30 to 35 F) and will not survive more than 8 to 10 hours in the snow. Another peculiar fact is that baobabs blossom, but the blooming period is very short, only about 24 hours.  Avenue of the Baobabs is often visited in a combination with Kirindy Forest Reserve. The departure point is Morondava, which offers modest hotels and restaurants."
44,The Pirate Cemetery,Madagascar,This picturesque island graveyard is the final resting place of dozens of notorious pirates.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-pirate-cemetery-analanjirofo-madagascar,"On the small island of Ile Sainte-Marie, four miles off the coast of eastern Madagascar, lie the bones of pirates who terrorized the seas during the 17th and 18th centuries. For around 100 years, Ile Sainte-Marie was the off-season home of an estimated 1,000 pirates. A recently discovered map from 1733 refers to it simply as “the island of pirates.” Situated near the East Indies trade route, the beautiful tropical island’s numerous inlets and bays made it the perfect place to hide ships. Pirates from all over the world lived in wooden huts, adorned with flags that signified which captain’s “crew” they belonged to. It was a pirate’s paradise. There were local women to satisfy their lust, and plenty of tropical fruit to satisfy their hunger. When one of the pirates died, they were buried on a scenic, palm shaded hilltop cemetery overlooking the water. Today, 30 headstones remain, including a few sketched with a skull and/or cross bones, the international symbol of piracy. Legend has it that the notorious William Kidd is buried in a large black tomb in the cemetery, sitting upright as punishment for his dastardly deeds. He was actually buried in England, but his legendary ship, the Adventure Galley (rediscovered in 2000), was left docked near the Island, and his booty is said to be buried somewhere in the surrounding sea. In fact, the prospect of undiscovered treasure, from at least half a dozen documented shipwrecks off the coast, continues to lure adventurous explorers to this very day. The pirates were off Ile Sainte-Marie by the late 1700s, when the French forcibly seized the island. It was returned to Madagascar in 1960. Today, Ile Saint-Marie is a thriving tourist destination. The crumbling cemetery, its graves half covered by tall, swaying grass, is open to the public. It is an ironically peaceful and still place, filled with the bones of violent and restless men.

45,Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park and Nature Reserve,"Antsalova, Madagascar","Fabulous formations, weird and wonderful wildlife.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tsingy-de-bemaraha,"The word tsingy is indigenous to the Malagasy language as a description of the badlands of Madagascar. The word can be translated into English as “where one cannot walk barefoot.” The tsingys are karstic plateaus where groundwater has undercut the elevated uplands, gouging caverns and fissures into the limestone. Because of local conditions, the erosion is patterned vertically as well as horizontally. In several regions on western Madagascar, centering on this National Park and adjacent Nature Reserve, the superposition of vertical and horizontal erosion patterns has created dramatic “forests” of limestone needles. Surpassingly difficult to traverse, this landscape has created refuges within a refuge, where endemic species can be subdivided into pockets perhaps as small as a single limestone spike. Most expeditions to the area find a plant or animal previously undescribed by science. Wonders await around every corner - if your shoes haven’t been chewed away by the harsh terrain."
46,Aven Cave,"Atsimo-Andrefana, Madagascar",This underwater cave in Madagascar is home to what is thought to be the country's largest fossil graveyard.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aven-cave,"A flooded cave in Madagascar’s Tsimanampetsotsa Nature Reserve is also the home of a recently discovered underwater graveyard filled with fossils of long-extinct species, some several thousand years old. A team of scientists led by Brooklyn College professor Alfred Rosenberger has discovered remarkably well-preserved fossils of turtles, rodents, crocodiles, and the elephant bird, an extinct flightless bird similar to an ostrich. “We have a real cross-section of tiny things and big things,” Rosenberger told National Geographic. The big things in this case are the cave’s largest supplier of bones, extinct giant lemurs. These predecessors to today’s lemurs lived up to their name, with some as large as gorillas. By comparison, the lemurs we know and love now range in weight from about an ounce up to 20 pounds. These giant primates went extinct between 2,000 and 500 years ago for reasons researchers are still trying to figure out. How these bones ended up in the cave is another mystery. Rosenberger thinks that many washed up in the cave over time, before and after humans found their way to Madagascar. Aven is one of three flooded caves in the park that researchers are exploring, and it may be Madagascar’s largest fossil graveyard. When the team first began exploring, the cave was so dense with bones that “divers felt them every time they put their hands down.” The Madagascar Cave Diving Association has recently set up an underwater museum to display some of the finds, and if you are an experienced diver, you can explore this submerged wonder.  As of 11/10/17, the cave is closed to divers as more scientific research is being conducted there. Contact the Madagascar Cave Diving Association for re-opening information and diving requirements."
47,Ambalabongo Canyon,"Marovoay, Madagascar",The runoff from these fiery cliffs sends red water flowing into the sea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ambalabongo-canyon,"This canyon stretches across the earth like a great red scar. The sandstone’s hues are so fiery, you’d be forgiven for mistaking it for Mars or some other martian landscape. This gorgeous gorge is found in Ankarafantsika Nature Reserve, a national park in northwestern Madagascar. Unlike the rainforests of the east and spiny dry forests of the south, Ankarafantsika is more of a dry tropical forest with some savannah. Although beautiful, this canyon has witnessed dark times thanks to heavy deforestation. Losing so many trees has left the land prone to erosion, which has caused the soil to crumble and move. The erosion is to the point that the red waters running into the sea can be seen from space. The canyon is a sight to behold, yet also a reminder to value and protect the plants that hold together such a wonderful place. Inside this reserve, animals like chameleons (the largest in the world), vanga birds, and speckled butterflies are plentiful to the point of distraction. Primates like sifakas lazily lounge outside villager houses waiting for handouts while mongoose lemurs forage in pairs far above in the tree canopy.  There are various hiking trails throughout the national park. The one that leads to the canyon is fairly strenuous, so take caution and wear appropriate hiking clothes."

49,Ambohimanga Main Gate,"Mampikony, Madagascar",Giant disc-shaped gate took 20 men to close off this city in Madagascar.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ambohimanga-main-gate,"In the 18th century, Ambohimanga was a town that needed to protect its royal family. Shielded naturally by forests, the town also erected a massive wall, and seven outer gates to protect its people. The main entrance of these seven gates guarding the town from attackers was known as Ambatomitsangana, the standing stone, and it proudly still waits in position to be used for protection. The standing stone is exactly as it sounds, a massive stone disc weighing 12 tons. As with many walled cities of the Merina Kingdom in Madagascar at the time, the gates were created out of circular discs that were pushed into position by hordes of men every night. The stone disc guarding Ambohimanga took 20 men, and was over 130 feet in circumference. Each night, these guards would roll the stone into position, blocking off the main entrance to the town. Today, the entire Ambohimanga area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is home to royal burial grounds, the queen’s pavilions and the gigantic standing stone."

But Liwonde also has a tragic history, the evidence of which is still visible deep inside the trunk of a massive baobab tree. Although predominately Christian, many of Malawi’s citizens adhere to an amalgam of Christian and more traditional, regional beliefs. Relatively common across these practices is the idea that those who are infected with certain diseases cannot be buried, for fear that their impurities would contaminate the earth. As recently as the 1950s, one particular tribe living in Liwonde suffered an outbreak of leprosy. In order to keep the disease from spreading, individuals were rounded up and led to a giant baobab at the base of Chinguni Hill. According to park guides, the infected individuals–those still living, along with the bodies of the recently dead–were bound and forced into the tree’s hollowed-out trunk and left there for nature to take its course. The “Leper Tree,” as it has become known, remains standing today though it doubles over to one side, and its bark peels and bursts in spots. On its trunk appears a hand-painted sign that simply reads: “The grave for people who suffered from leprosy in the past.” Visitors brought to the site are told of this history and encouraged to look down into the center of the tree, where the empty sockets of human skulls plainly stare back up at the faces of the living, forcing a moment of stark contemplation in the midst of the park’s vast natural beauty. Once inside Liwonde National park, the most prominent landmark in the park's southern area is Chinguni Hill, which is encircled by a dirt road. The tree can be found near the base of the hill."
51,Saint Michael and All Angels Church,"Blantyre, Malawi",This amateur-built East African church with mismatched towers is an architectural abnormality.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saint-michael-and-all-angels-church,"Constructed by worshippers lacking any prior architectural or building experience, this remarkable amateur-built ecclesiastical anomaly has stood out in Blantyre, Malawi, since 1891. Blantyre, Malawi’s second largest city and its capital of commerce and industry, was founded in 1876 by Scottish missionaries and named after a small town outside Glasgow, Scotland. Little remains to hint at the bustling East African city’s Scottish roots, except for this seemingly out-of-place Presbyterian Church, which is said to be “the first permanent Christian church erected between the Zambezi and the Nile.” The current building was the brainchild of Scottish missionary and architecture rookie Reverend David Clement Scott, meant to replace a much less grand Presbyterian chapel. There were no detailed plans or drawings made for the church outside of Scott’s imagination. Beginning in 1888, brickwork was simply laid dry without mortar to test for strength and aesthetics before continuing to the next layer of the 37-foot-high structure. The clay for the bricks was excavated and baked in wood kilns on site by parishioners, allowing the whole cathedral-like edifice to be erected in just three years. The laborers on the project were all local people who had no prior experience in this type of construction. Despite this, the anomalous amateur-built church, with its mismatched towers and Moorish domed bell tower, has withstood the test of time. It has been designated a national monument by the Malawian Department of Antiquities and is a symbol of and source of pride for the city of Blantyre. Blantyre is easily reached by air or coach from the capital Lilongwe. There are regular connecting flights to Lilongwe, Addis Ababa, Nairob,i and Johannesburg for international and intercontinental connections."
52,Karonga Museum,"Karonga, Malawi","A cultural center on the shores of Lake Malawi dedicated to preserving Karonga’s past and present, including the fossilized remains of the Malawisaurus.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/karonga-museum,"It’s an eight-hour drive from Malawi’s capital city Lilongwe to Karonga, a district seated on the northwest banks of Lake Malawi. Karonga encompasses a rift valley, a low-lying region where the earth’s crust pulls apart. Rifting unearths ancient sediment and rock strata, making the discovery of fossils easier, and helping to piece together Earth’s long history. In Karonga, that history includes the discovery of the geological formation known as the Dinosaur Beds, where numerous fossils dating back millions of years have been discovered in the last century. The early ancestors of mammals from the Triassic period and Jurassic-Cretaceous-era dinosaurs thrived in this region, leading to some awe-inspiring discoveries. In 1928, South African paleontologist Sidney H. Haughton unearthed the first complete fossilized remains of the Malawisaurus, a Cretaceous-period dinosaur that lived around 125 million years ago. Remains that appear to be the same dinosaur have also been found in Brazil, supporting the theory that these dinosaurs were living when the continents now known as South America and Africa were splitting apart. In the following decades, prehistoric remains continued to emerge from Karonga’s rift valley, drawing researchers and paleontologists from around the world. In 1983, two scientists established the Hominid Corridor Research project, which focused on the study of early human environments and hominid remains. These early ancestors are dated between one million and eight million years old, establishing Karonga as a contender for the coveted title of “cradle of humankind,” alongside Ethiopia and South Africa. In 2004, the Cultural & Museum Centre Karonga was officially established as a home for fossils on display, with the Malawisaurus as its pièce de résistance, and as a research facility for the Hominid Corridor project and other excavations. A cultural center and camp for schools and seminars opened 10 years later, with a display of ancient human artifacts, archeological records, and colorful murals depicting the evolution of our early ancestors. An exhibition titled “Dinosaurs to Democracy” includes the history of the slave trade, life under colonial rule, and the modern traditions of the Karonga community.  Visitors can take a bus from Lilongwe to Karonga for about $18, and should expect a ride of between 7.5 and 8 hours. If you’re staying in Blantyre, be sure to budget travel time between 11 and 12 hours. Email the museum in advance (karongamuseum@gmail.com) to confirm your visit and arrange further transport if necessary."
53,The Stone House Museum,"Livingstonia, Malawi",A history of European missionaries in Malawi.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stone-house-museum-livingstonia,"High up on an escarpment overlooking Lake Malawi sits the small town of Livingstonia, established by missionaries from the Free Church of Scotland in 1894. In the middle of the town is the Stone House Museum. Located in the former home of Dr. Robert Laws, who served as head of the Livingstonia Mission for more than 50 years, the museum tells of those first missionaries and of the arrival of Europeans in Malawi, then known as Nyasaland. Perhaps more interesting, however, than the contents of the museum, is the story behind a collection of white rocks lying in the overgrown grass beside the building. In February 1959, during Malawi’s struggle for independence from Britain, violence had broken out in the district of Rumphi, where Livingstonia is located. Concerned for the safety of the Europeans living in Livingstonia, the federal government made contact by dropping two unloaded gas canisters from a plane into the town. The canisters contained a message, telling the missionaries a boat would be ready to evacuate them from the nearby town of Chitimba if they felt they were in danger. The message advised that another plane would return the following day to receive an answer. The missionaries should respond by laying stones on the lawn outside Dr. Laws’ house in the shape of Roman numerals: an “I” if they felt safe and a “V” if they wished to leave. The missionaries held a meeting that afternoon during which they decided not only to stay, but also to send a clear message of peace, unity, and harmony during a time of extreme racial tension. When the plane flew over Livingstonia the following day, a collection of whitewashed stones had been laid on the lawn, spelling out “Ephesians 2 v 14” A photograph of the message taken from the plane appeared on the front cover of the Rhodesian Herald the following day and in the Manchester Guardian a few days later. Ephesians 2 v 14: “for He is our prince who has made us both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us.”  If you wish to visit the Stone House Museum the most adventurous (and, arguably, exciting!) way to reach the town is via the Gorode. The Gorode is a 20-hairpin bend road, ascending 1,000 meters from the town of Chitimba up to Livingstonia. Public transport options up the mountain include motorbikes or trucks. Where the paved road of Chitimba meets the dirt of the Gorode you will usually not have long to wait before willing drivers arrive to offer you transport."
54,Great Mud Mosque of Djenné,"Djenne, Mali",The central mosque of this Mali town is entirely built from mud.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/great-mud-mosque-of-djenne,"Rising up at the center of Djenné, Mali, is the Great Mosque. Built in 1907, everything from its minarets to its spired walls is constructed from mud. In fact, the whole historic town of Djenné has been built from this mud architecture since the 14th century, in a tradition passed down from generation to generation. The process involves baking mud and straw bricks in the sun and stacking them to create walls that are then plastered with mud. The mosque (together with some 200 historic homes in the city) requires regular re-plastering to keep its form. Recent political upheavals and a drought have threatened the mud architecture of Djenné, and so has the emergence of more modern building materials. However, while some Mali mosques have added electricity and other technology, the citizens of Djenné are dedicated to their historic building and only a loudspeaker system has been incorporated into the structure.  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) currently advise against traveling to some parts of Mali, therefore their website should be consulted before booking your flights. Moreover, since 1996, non-Muslims are not allowed inside the mosque."
55,Bandiagara Escarpment Cliff Dwellings,"Bandiagara, Mali",These homes carved into the mountains seem to defy the laws of nature.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cliff-dwellings-bandiagara-escarpment,"The Bandiagara Escarpment slices across the hot and dusty lands of the Sahel in Mali for over 100 miles. In itself, Bandiagara is a wonder of nature. The cliffs rise over 1,500 feet in the air in places and range in geographic diversity from desert to cascading waterfalls plummeting onto the plains below. However, almost more impressive than the landscape are the Dogon homes carved into the escarpment. Although a range of people lived in the area, for over 600 years the Dogon people have made Southern Mali their home, carving everything from simple rectangular homes into the cliff walls to detailed Mosque’s made out of mud and stick. The Dogon’s contribution to the region is immense. The entire concept of their village is stunning, as homes hang from the cliffs defying all natural bounds of the traditional city. Some of the villages can hardly even be seen as they blend seamlessly with the rocky cliffs that surround them. Others are only noticeable from their thatched roofs, protruding from the sand and rock. Every aspect of the Bandiagara is strongly punctuated. The escarpment itself rises dustily from the sparse Sahel vegetation below and the homes of the Dogon villages dot the cliffs for miles until the escarpment terminates at the highest peak in Mali, Hombori Tondo. There are thirty Dogon villages in total across the escarpment and a multitude of Dogon sites aside from the houses. The dramatic landscape has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1989. Much of the Dogon’s original cultural traditions still exist, including mask rituals and cave shrines. Visitors to the region can also stay directly in the Dogon villages along the escarpment, allowing for a truly unique hostel experience.  The main bases for organizing your trek are Mopti-Sévaré, Douentza or Bakass. Within the Dogon country, Bandiagara and Sanga can also be used as starting points. Most people opt by a three-day trek starting from Bandiagara. It is important to know that much of Dogon country is very rough, and you will be rock scrambling and climbing to the cliffs under intense heat. Guides are essential in the Dogon country and you can make arrangements in any of the villages mentioned above."
56,Timbuktu Manuscripts,"Timbuktu, Mali",Ancient Manuscripts showcase the civilization of West Africans during the Middle Ages.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/timbuktu-manuscripts-mali,"Hundreds of thousands of ancient manuscripts have been collected in Timbuktu, Mali, the legendary city founded as a commercial center in West Africa 900 years ago. Hidden in cellars or buried, hid between the mosque’s mud walls and safeguarded by their patrons, many of these manuscripts survived the city’s decline. They now form the collection of several libraries in Timbuktu, which hold up to 700,000 manuscripts. Some were written in the town itself, others (including exclusive copies of the Qur’an for wealthy families) were imported through the lively book trade. Timbuktu was once a flourishing center of Saharan trade, and the home of a prestigious university, l’Université de Sankoré de Tombouctou, believed to be one of the first in the world. It was known, at its peak, as a city of books. The manuscripts are written in various styles of the Arabic script and date back to as early as the 13th century. These styles were developed in Timbuktu and the surrounding regions of Mali and West Africa. Timbuktu’s fortunes came crashing down at the end of the 16th century as trade routes shifted, and by the Victorian era it had become a lonely desert outpost. The largest single collection of manuscripts in Timbuktu - about 18,000 of them - is housed at the Ahmed Baba Institute. The rest are scattered throughout the city’s many private libraries and collections (like the Imam Essayouti, Al Aquib, and Al Wangara manuscript libraries). They have suffered the ravages of time, but are at risk, particularly from Mali’s rainy season. Digital images of the manuscripts were donated by Abdel Kader Haidara, owner and director of the Mamma Haidara Commemorative Library. The Library of Congress will include additional manuscripts in the future as new digital images are received. An exhibit of items from the Mamma Haidara Commemorative Library is available at the Library of Congress. Started in 2008 as a part of UNESCO’s Memory of the World Programme and a NEPAD Cultural Project, the Timbuktu Manuscripts Project aims to catalogue and preserve the works.  Some of the manuscripts can be visited in the ""Bibliothèques familiales des Imams Essayouti"" a few years ago. In September of 2013, a suicide bombing in the vicinity of the library shuddered some basic structures, but these were restored in 2015. The British Library is now undertaking the digitization of these libraries in situ in Timbuktu, where work is underway in the Imam Essayouti library since October 2017."
57,Tomb of Askia,"Gao, Mali",The most important and best preserved remnant of West Africa's powerful Songhai Empire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tomb-of-askia,"The Tomb of Askia was built by Askia Muhammad, the Emperor of Songhai, in 1495. Located in Gao, a city in Mali near the banks of the River Niger, the dramatic and notably spiky-looking pyramidal tomb is part of a complex that also includes two flat-roofed mosque buildings, the mosque cemetery, and an open-air assembly ground. Askia Muhammad was a West African statesman and military leader who took the throne of the Songhai Empire in 1493. He was a highly capable ruler who introduced an efficient administrative system across the lands of his sprawling empire, one of the largest states in African history. He divided Songhai into provinces, each with its own governor, and created new positions for the directors of finance, justice, interior, agriculture, water, and more. He also built a standing army under the command of a general, and appointed an admiral to command his fleet of war canoes. Askia Muhammad was a pious man and soon established Islam as the religion of the nobles. When Gao became the official capital of the Empire, and Islam was adopted as its official religion, Muhammad ordered the construction of what is now known as the Tomb of Askia. The centerpiece of the complex is the 56-foot-tall (17 meters) pyramidal structure, today considered the finest remaining example of the monumental mud-building traditions of the Songhai Empire. The style is unique to the West African Sahel, and represents a merger of Islamic tradition and local building practices, which had to adapt to the environment. The pyramid’s dramatic “spiky” appearance is due to the permanent acacia-wood scaffolding that juts out across its surface. The tomb was constructed with wet plaster and mud, which has to be reapplied every year after the rainy season. As such, the pyramid undergoes an annual remodeling, hence the permanent scaffolding and the fluid, rounded nature of the structure’s outer surface. As for Askia Muhammad, he was eventually laid to rest and sealed inside the tomb after a family feud of epic proportions. Near the end of his reign, Muhammad was old and half blind, with no one at his side apart from his loyal friend, servant, and adviser, Ali Folen. Knowing that their father was losing his grip on the empire, Muhammad’s children began fighting among themselves. His eldest son, Musa, unseated Muhammad in 1529 during a bloodless coup and banished his father to an island in the river infested with mosquitoes and toads. From here, the blind Muhammad heard the reports of his warring sons. Musa killed a few of his own brothers and at least 25 of his cousins before his own brothers had him assassinated in 1531. It was not until 1537 that Muhammad’s son and third successor, Askia Ismaïl, recalled his father to Gao. Muhammad died a year later and was buried inside the Tomb of Askia, which is today one of the most important and venerated mosques in all of West Africa.  The Tomb of Askia is located along Avenue des Askia in the north of Gao. Gao is the capital of the Gao Region of Mali and is situated on the River Niger, about 200 miles east-southeast of Timbuktu. Gao has an international airport and is linked to other cities, including Timbuktu, by a ferry service along the Niger River. Tours of the Tomb of Askia can be arranged in Gao, but check the local political situation before you visit. Rebel forces captures Gao in 2012, followed by Islamist militias; they were expelled a year later by French military forces, but foreigners still need to be careful throughout much of Mali."
58,Djingareyber Mosque,"Timbuktu, Mali","One of Western Africa's oldest mosques, this Timbuktu icon has stood for nearly 700 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/djingareyber-mosque,"Since word of the alleged “city of gold” reached Europe in the mid-1500s, “Timbuktu” has become slang for a destination so extremely remote it’s practically unreachable—or perhaps even imaginary. Among the fabled settlement’s most famed icons is the Djingareyber Mosque, a holy structure and learning center that was built in 1327 and is still in operation today as one of the three mosques that make up the University of Timbuktu. The Djingareyber Mosque, which was built almost entirely out of mud, straw, and wood, has weathered a long succession of wars, conflicts, and political upheavals over the course of the last eight centuries. The most recent of these occurred in 2012 when militant Islamists captured the city and began terrorizing the local population. After seizing control of Timbuktu, militants quickly instituted their own draconian version of Sharia law, stoning women for failing to wear proper Islamic attire and cutting off the hands of musicians who were caught violating the totalitarian ban on all forms of music. Soon, their attention turned toward Timbuktu’s historic cultural artifacts, including its ancient Muslim shrines, which they declared forbidden by Islam. The militants destroyed the tombs of seven Muslim saints with hoes and pickaxes, two of which were at Djingareyber. The Islamists were pushed out of Timbuktu in early 2013 by French soldiers sent to liberate the city. Despite their defeat, Timbuktu remains a dangerous place to visit and, while Djingareyber and the adjacent museum that houses some of the mosque’s most cherished Islamic manuscripts, are technically open to visitors, reaching the city via commercial means has become practically impossible.  Timbuktu's once thriving and lucrative tourism industry has gone all but extinct as a result of ongoing security threats in northern Mali, rendering this famed destination off-limits for the time being."
59,Antogo Fishing Frenzy,"Koro, Mali",Annual rush for a sacred desert lake's fish stock.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/antogo-fishing-frenzy,"Once a year, the people of the Dogon rush the sacred Antogo Lake in Mali. In a flurry of activity, the Dogon grab at the water feverishly hoping to snatch a fish. The lake itself is a rarity in a country comprised mostly of the Sahara desert and the dry steppes of the Sahel, which undoubtedly lends to its importance and sacredness. Although the lake is sacred, it is small and murky, and within minutes the Dogon fisherman empty the lake of all its inhabitants. Throughout the year, it is illegal to fish in the lake. However, after the ban is lifted, fishermen file into the lake to grab whatever they can during the short-lived Antogo fishing frenzy. The frenzy occurs during the dry season in Mali, which allows the fish to be easily caught in the shrunken lake. The ritual is strongly based on ancestor worship, and along with other rituals in Dogon culture, women are prohibited from participating. Although women cannot join in the festivities, legend holds that a young woman discovered the lake and its miraculous fish, starting the chain of ritual fishing in the desert pool. Regardless, the Antogo festival is a spectacle like no other opening day for fishing across the world. The elders of the Dogon villages decide the date of the fishing frenzy each year but it generally falls in the dry season in the early summer months."
60,Gaddafi Canal,"Gourma Rharous, Mali",Muammar Gaddafi's well-intentioned investment in his favorite city turned out to be a nightmare.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gaddafi-canal,"In 2006, when Muammar Gaddafi was still the dictator of Libya, he paid the city of Timbuktu in Mali a visit to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad. He brought in hundreds of people to the city to pray with him in a soccer stadium after declaring himself the imam of the city. Gaddafi declared Timbuktu to be his favorite city publicly, and spoke of his great plans to use his immense wealth to shape it into the best condition it could be. He bought a crumbling and rundown hotel on the outskirts of the city and had it renovated for millions of euros. To allow the guests to travel to the hotel by boat, he also had an 8-mile (13 km) canal dug from the hotel to the river Niger south of the city. However, as a result of the Arab Spring in 2011 and the NATO led bombings of Libya, Gaddafi was overthrown and killed by rebels. Following these events, Gaddafi’s projects in Timbuktu started crumbling.  Before long, the canal was silted up and dried. As if that wasn’t enough, the canal also proved to be a death trap to locals once it flooded.  What had once been a natural shallow branch of the river Niger had been turned into a deep canal with steep, slippery sandy banks that people and animals couldn’t escape.  Most countries advise against all travel to most parts of Mali (2017), including the region and city of Timbuktu."
61,Mauritania Railway,"Choum, Mauritania",Climb atop one of the world's longest and heaviest trains for an unbelievable journey across the Sahara Desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mauritanias-iron-ore-train,"There are some train rides that you’ll never forget. Riding Mauritania’s Iron Ore Train is definitely one of those. It doesn’t matter if you’re eastbound or westbound—what matters is that this train ride truly embodies the idiom that it’s all about the journey, not the destination. First, a few facts: Operating since 1963, the iron ore train covers 437 miles (704 kilometers) on its journey across the Sahara Desert from Nouadhibou, on the coast, to Zouérat, an iron mine in the center of Mauritania. Consisting of more than 200 carriages and three or four locomotives, the train can reach over a mile (about 2.5 to three kilometers) in length and carry 17,000 tons of iron ore, making it one of the longest and heaviest trains in the world. But iron isn’t the only thing this beast of a train typically carries. Additional passenger carriages can be attached to the train, but most often, passengers sit on top of the ore. The train can carry road vehicles as well, and if you are self-driving, you have to make arrangements for your vehicle to tag along for the ride. Once your vehicle is on the train, you can decide to travel inside it, on top of the ore, or a combination of the two. Hitchhiking on this train and sitting atop a bed of iron ore is not an easy ride, but it can be the train ride of a lifetime. The train runs through one of the harshest environments on earth. It’s sun-scorched during the day and bitterly cold at night, and you’d better prepare for both, as there is no shelter on the train, unless you brought your own vehicle to hunker down in. If you’re wondering about toilets, the answer is no: there aren’t any. There is also no way to stock up on your food supplies. Along the way, you can expect to see rocks, sand, shrubs, camels, goats, and solitary ramshackle huts. Oh, and dust—lots of dust. Once your eyes get used to the dust and adjust to the environment, you can start appreciating the different shades and hues that different kinds of sand can take from a certain angle and in a certain light. Once it gets dark, you can usually see the Milky Way stretching across the night sky. Walking around along the train is allowed in the sense that no-one is checking, but it can be dangerous as there are no barriers, emergency brakes, or, in fact, safety measures of any kind. Starting off is a painfully slow affair, with carriages slamming into one another and jolting everyone in or on them. Violent jolts can reoccur unexpectedly throughout the journey. The train does not make any official stops from Nouadhibou to Choum, but the train does stop for prayers. Some passengers will get off the train to perform the ritual and get back on as soon as the train starts jolting forward.  Get to Nouadhibou, Choum, or Zouérat in advance. A train should get going within 24 hours. Ask around, especially if you want to get your vehicle on board. Pack some food and lots of water—pack more water than you think you might need. And finally, bring a blanket for the night and have a scarf or turban at hand for the whole trip. It is not clear what time the train leaves and arrives. A fair amount of waiting time should, therefore, be expected. Not counting the waiting time, it takes approximately 19 hours to cover the whole distance. Only passengers with their own vehicle usually go all the way to Zouérat, as apart from the iron ore, there is little else there. Most people hop off (or get on) at Choum, a few hours away from Mauritania’s capital Nouakchott, with a fair amount of traffic going either way on any given day. Bear in mind that there are no paved roads. These are all dirt tracks running through the desert."
62,Richat Structure,Mauritania,A geological bull's-eye visible from outer space.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/richat-structure,"In the midst of the vast, vacant Sahara desert, just outside of Ouadane, Mauritania, lies a 30-mile wide geological oddity known the Richat Structure, sometimes called the “Eye of Africa.” From space, this natural curiosity forms a distinct and unmistakable bull’s-eye that once served as a geographical landmark for early astronauts as they passed over the Sahara. Once thought to be an impact crater due to its circularity, the unusual formation is now widely believed to have been caused by the erosion of a geological dome formed by pressure from a bulb of molten magma below. The desert floor ‘blistered,’ and as the layers of rock were pushed up and fractured, millennia of weathering gradually leveled them flat again, exposing the structure’s distinctive concentric rings."
63,The Libraries of Chinguetti,"Chinguetti, Mauritania","Five ancient libraries, little changed for centuries, preserve a medieval archive of Quranic lore and civic documents",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-libraries-of-chinguetti-chinguetti-mauritania,"Situated on the bleak Adrar plateau, the city of Chinguetti contains some of the world’s most important Quranic texts amid its simple earthen libraries. Established around 777 AD, Chinguetti became an important trading outpost on the Timbuktu caravan route to the Mediterranean. At the same time it became a gathering place for Islamic pilgrims on their way to Mecca. With the steady traffic of holy people through the city, a large, stone mosque was built and small libraries were founded to contain the growing number of religious texts left behind. Preserving the tradition of trading and passing down such holy writings, most of the original Chinguetti libraries exist in largely the same state as when they were deposited. Today there are five such libraries left in Chinguetti containing some 1,300 Quranic manuscripts, as well as civil records including contracts, bills of sale, and legal judgments. The dry desert air and dedication of generations of custodians have helped preserve the fragile parchments, often rolled inside bamboo tubes. On occasion, the crumbling texts are gingerly inspected by scholars who still visit the site to study Islamic Law. Preservationists have attempted to relocate the collections or set up restoration programs locally, but the libraries’ private owners resist. UNESCO has awarded Chinguetti and other nearby ancient settlements World Heritage status, and efforts are being made to save the city and its libraries from neglect.  Mauritania's tourism has dwindled in recent years but once you get to Atar, it's relatively easy to organize the ride to Chingeutti, where there are several tourist lodgings. Your hosts will be able to help you make a visit to the one library, which is commonly visited by tour groups."
64,Ouadane Mosque,"Ouadane, Mauritania",This remarkably well-preserved mosque stands amid an 11th-century caravansary.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ouadane-mosque,"When Ouadane was founded is a matter of contention, but it’s generally agreed the city rose to prominence in the 11th century. Alongside Chinguetti, Tichitt, and Oualata, Ouadane became an important trading and religious center along one of the most important trans-Saharan routes. The walls surrounding old Ouadane suggest it was a ksar, or fortified village. Buildings in the ksar that have not already crumbled to the ground are in a precarious state of disrepair, with one notable exception: the old mosque. Built in the 15th century, the mosque received some restoration attention without detracting from its ancient charm. The structure itself is relatively small, but the uncovered rounded rows of horseshoe arches create an intriguing and at times disorienting architectural feature. Like all mosques, the old mosque in Ouadane has a minaret, but unlike most mosques, this minaret is neither tall nor narrow. With a square base of 4 or 5 meters on each side, and no higher than a two-story house, this minaret is reminiscent of a turret built for military purposes. Yet, the shape and size of this structure may be the reason why it lasted so long. The arches, yard, and minaret are all built with stones found locally, with traces of clay plastering that was applied to fortify the structure in the 19th century."
65,Abandoned Resort,"Kaédi, Mauritania",The beehive-like buildings of this abandoned resort reside near the border of Mauritania and Senegal.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-resort-kaedi,"If savannah is the transitional ecosystem between desert and forest, the city of Kaédi is located in a region where desert and savannah meet. This is the Gorgol region of southern Mauritania. Located just north of the Senegal River, this is one of the few places in Mauritania where agriculture is a possible, but it is a far cry from classifying as a fertile area. Vast arid expanses punctuated by tiny villages dominate the landscape for hundreds of kilometers along the river. One of the major settlements along this strip of land is Kaédi, a small city with a few intersecting roads stemming from the market. Of note, in 1989 a regional hospital was built in Kaédi by the renowned Italian architect Fabrizio Carola. The hospital featured domed circular structures connected by vaulted corridors that made the complex look like the product of a futuristic dream. This structure must have inspired a brave entrepreneur to build a resort in the same style a few kilometers outside of Kaédi. Surrounded by nothing but spectacular landscape, this resort was open until 2017. The family from across the road now “keep an eye” on this abandoned resort, but they can offer no information about the resort other than the date of its closure. All the red-brick domed units of the complex are connected by narrow vaulted passageways. Each unit is endowed with one or two small glassless windows that can be closed with a shutter. Each unit has a set of three-inch by four-inch glass blocks on its dome to let light in. These thick glass blocks are so effective at capturing and dispersing sunlight within the unit that they can be mistaken for spotlights. In spite of the high summer temperatures, the structure remains cool throughout the day.  The resort is fenced off, but the family across the road can show you how to get in.  There is no entry fee, but a small tip is recommended."
66,Port de Pêche,"Nouakchott, Mauritania",Thousands of colorful pirogues showcase ingenious craftsmanship at the largest fishermen port in Nouakchott.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/port-de-peche,"No matter what time of the day or what day of the week, Port de Pêche is always hectic. There are always fishing boats setting off and others returning, with the daily catch quickly unloaded and taken the market on donkey-drawn carts. But the real eye candy are the throngs of pirogues lying idle on the sand banks, one beside the other, row after row. Each part of the vessels has a unique, custom-made cut and is painted with bright colors. Drawings representing animals, people, traditional patterns, and symbols adorn the boats as well. These pirogues are built by artisans of Fula and Wolof ethnicity, originally from Senegal but well-established within this segment of Mauritanian economy. A small 10-foot-long pirogue takes about a week to build, whereas a 70-foot-long pirogue takes about a month. It’s difficult to estimate their durability, as this depends largely on how often a pirogue is used, how well it is maintained, and how good it was initially built, but 15 years seems to be the longest one can hope for. The beach in front of the market is frantic with activities. It is nothing short of a cacophony of colors, smells, and sounds. There are people refueling or waterproofing boats, mending fishing nets, or resting and chatting. Closer to the market, there are people rinsing and gutting fish. There are women selling snacks, cooking, and catching up with the latest news. Children play soccer, swim, and chase one another.  You can easily reach the port via taxi from the city center. Do not attempt to swim here, as the current can be quite strong."
67,Galerie Zeinart,"Nouakchott, Mauritania",The quaint gallery displays works by artists from all across Mauritania.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/galerie-zeinart,"Galerie Zeinart is a place where local artists can showcase their work to a large audience. The place itself is relatively small, an L-shaped room of no more than 500 square feet in total, but the quality of the art on display is impressive. At regular intervals, the place is packed with artwork by artists from all over Mauritania. Notable examples include Mamadou Anne, with his signature animals surfacing from semi-abstract works, making a powerful statement about the impact of contemporary life on the planet; Désirée Trotha, the creator of photographic chronicles of Nouakchott; or Nancy Abeiderrahmane, who captures glimpses of desert life and its subtle colors on canvas.  Interestingly, the artists whose work is on display are usually present at Zeinart, eager to talk to visitors. The gallery offers more than temporary exhibitions, as some jewelry, ornaments, masks, and other artifacts produced locally are on permanent display and available for sale. Outside the gates of Zeinart’s serene manicured garden, the bustle of Nouakchott continues, as if it were a different planet."
68,Moroccan Western Sahara Wall,Mauritania,This fortified sand barrier dividing a contested territory is the longest minefield in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moroccan-wall-of-western-sahara,"Barbed wire, electric fences, thousands of armed soldiers, and an estimated seven million landmines run along what much of the world sees as the southern part of Morocco. But this strip of land is actually the disputed territory of Western Sahara, a swath of ungoverned desert just south of Morocco and northwest of Mauritania. This war-torn territory is divided by the Moroccan Wall, a 1,600-mile-long, 10-foot-tall fortified berm, or sand wall. At 16 times longer than the Berlin wall was, the Moroccan Wall, also known as “the Berm,” is one of the largest active military barriers. Landmines dot the length of the fortification, making it also the longest minefield in the world. The portion of land to the west of the wall, along the Atlantic Ocean, is controlled by Morocco. The eastern side is governed by the Polisario Front, a Sahrawi liberation movement. The fight for Sahrawi independence is what drove Spain, which had ruled Western Sahara for more than 90 years, out of the region in 1976. When Spain withdrew, Morocco took over the Atlantic coast and Mauritania the eastern portion, which was eventually overtaken by Sahrawi fighters. Morocco began building a wall through the territory in 1981 to keep out guerilla fighters and refugees from the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The barrier was completed in 1987, and though hostilities officially ended in 1991, the wall is still heavily guarded with radar and other surveillance equipment. Still, the Polisario Front has occasionally been able to successfully burrow under the structure. The landmines along the berm have caused many deaths and casualties among Sahrawi civilians, most of whom live in refugee camps on both sides of the wall. Since 2008, thousands of Sahrawi refugees and international human rights activists have gathered at an annual demonstration called The Thousand Column and created a human chain to protest the wall and demand its demolition. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about the Moroccan Wall."
69,Old Mosque,"Chinguetti, Mauritania",An architectural relic that survived the hands of time.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-mosque,"Visitors to Chinguetti have the chance to see new Chinguetti, where most accommodations are located, and old Chinguetti, the semi-abandoned, half-buried city where ancient libraries can be found. There is, however, a third Chinguetti, which has almost entirely been reclaimed by the desert. A little over one mile (two kilometers) northeast of modern Chinguetti, on the way to the village of Entkemkemt, the desert track runs through a set of unimpressive sand dunes. Buried under these sand dunes are the remains of the older Chinguetti. Chinguetti was founded in the year 777 CE and became a major trading, cultural, and religious hub in the region by the 11th-century. It was around this time that Chinguetti reached its apogee and started declining. After two centuries of steady decline, the settlement was eventually abandoned and a new Chinguetti was re-established as a fortified trading center. It is undetermined whether remains from the original Chinguetti can be found among the ruins under these dunes. The terrain is harsh, interspersed with thorny bushes, scrawny goats, and ramshackle huts. There is, however, one imposing, isolated building that stands out. It is the only building from older Chinguetti that has been kept clear of the sand: the Old Mosque. It consists of a prayer room and a minaret. The square-based minaret showcases some outstanding stonework that clearly stood the test of time. The top of the minaret is adorned with four pinnacles that are characteristic of Mauritanian religious architecture. The prayer room is dominated by four arched entryways. The building is unadorned and unattended, but it is still used by local farmers."
70,Monument to the Battle of Oum Tounsi,Mauritania,"Initially meant to immortalize the valor of the colonizer, this monument is now a symbol of Mauritanian resistance.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-to-the-battle-of-oum-tounsi,"The earliest documented contact between Mauritanian and European merchants dates back to 1442, but sporadic trading certainly predates the 15th century. The year 1442 marks the moment when the Portuguese established the first permanent presence in the territory that later became Mauritania.  Although this establishment had more to do with trade than with political control, its ramifications run through the rest of Mauritanian history. Between the 15th and 19th centuries, the Spanish, Dutch, and British also established some form of trading posts in Mauritania, but it was the French that eventually claimed sovereignty over this land. In 1840, after years of trade and political alliances, France issued a decree that claimed possession of Senegal. Most of the territory identified as Senegal, however, was located in modern-day Mauritania. The part of modern-day Mauritania that France was not able to claim was the inland regions of the country. These regions were barren and plagued by the harshest weather conditions imaginable. Inevitably, only the sturdiest and most resilient people called this land home. Among these were the emirates of Trarza and Brakna united against their common enemy: France. After years of local skirmishes and full-fledged battles, the parties finally signed a treaty in which the two emirates became French protectorates. This situation persisted up to the beginning of the 20th century, when France declared ownership over all Mauritania, now considered a political entity separate from Senegal. In spite of efforts to pacify the inland regions, animosity persisted against the French. Among the episodes that punctuated this volatile situation, the Battle of Oum Tounsi (aka Umm-Tunisi) stands out. It was the year 1932, and Lieutenant Patrick de Mac Mahon was the head of a French contingent made up of French, Senegalese, and Mauritanian soldiers. Mounted on camels, they were coming from Samara, about 1,500 kilometers to the north. To travel across the desert for so long, the contingent had to do as ancient merchants did, and rely on natural springs and wells. One of these wells was in Oum Tounsi, a nondescript location about 80 kilometers north of Nouakchott. It was in Oum Tounsi that the contingent was ambushed by 120 Oulad Delim men armed with French and Spanish rifles. The battle was fierce and by the end, the land was strewn with corpses. Thirty-seven men from the French contingent died, including Lieutenant Mac Mahon. The Oulad Delim forces also lost 25 men, but managed to capture the weapons and camels from the French. Subsequently, the French authorities decided to erect a mausoleum to honor Lieutenant Mac Mahon. However, what was meant to immortalize the valor of the French colonizers, was quickly reclaimed to stand as a symbol of Mauritanian resistance against the French colonizers. Reflecting this, today the mausoleum is better known as the Monument to the Battle of Oum Tounsi. The design of this relatively small structure (about four meters tall) is dominated by Arabic architectural elements, perhaps to acknowledge the number of local soldiers that lost their lives here. If there were inscriptions on the stones at the center, they are no longer discernible due to unsightly graffiti and overexposure to the elements. Not far from the monument is the well that Lieutenant Mac Mahon and his contingent probably used on the fatal day.  The Monument to the Battle of Oum Tounsi can be seen from the main road (N1) that connects Nouakchott to Atar. There is no pathway to lead to the monument, but it is only 500 meters from the road. If you can resist exploring the sand dunes beyond the monument, it is almost impossible to get lost. There are no shops or gas stations anywhere near this site.  Expect scorching temperatures, but also be aware that nights can be surprisingly cold, depending on the season."
71,Bay of Nouadhibou Ship Graveyard,"Nouadhibou, Mauritania",The world's largest ship graveyard is the product of decades of corruption.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bay-of-nouadhibou-ship-graveyard,"The view off the coast of Mauritania’s Bay of Nouadhibou is spotted with rusting hulks in every direction, ships that were cheaper to illegally abandon in the harbor than to correctly dismantle. The city of Nouadhibou is the second largest settlement in Mauritania, but due to the limited employment opportunities, it is also somewhat poor. This economic hardship, as it often does, led to widespread corruption in the local government. Dismantling large boats is a costly procedure, and unscrupulous ship owners found that for a comparatively small bribe they could simply abandon their unwanted sea hulks in Nouadhibou’s bay. Ships were brought from all over the world to be left in the shallow waters with a particular boom during the 1980’s. Fishing trawlers, cargo vessels, and naval cruisers are just some of the varied types of boats among the over 300 rusting ships that have accumulated over the years like coral. Despite the environmental concerns of toxic oils, paints, and rust seeping into the waters of the bay, the rotting ships have produced a few surprising benefits.
