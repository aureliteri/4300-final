0,Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania,"Tipaza, Algeria",The original resting place of Queen Cleopatra and Mark Antony's only daughter.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/royal-mausoleum-of-mauretania,"While it’s one of the least visited countries in the world, Algeria boasts some of the most well-preserved and diverse Roman ruins outside of Italy. Among its largest relics is the marvelously imposing tomb of the only daughter of one of history’s most famous leaders. While Cleopatra has become a staple of modern culture, her daughter Princess Cleopatra Selene II is much less well known. Born in Egypt around 40 BC, Cleopatra Selene was brought to Rome after her parents committed suicide following her father Mark Antony’s defeat in the Battle of Actium. Some 10 to 16 years later, she was married to Juba II, a Berber prince from modern-day Algeria. The newlyweds were given orders to rule Mauretania, a previously unorganized and loosely governed Roman vassal state spreading from Algeria and Morocco, which they did quite successfully until Cleopatra Selene died sometime around 6 BC. The mausoleum in which the princess was buried was commissioned by her husband and, given its size, seems to have been intended to house the remains of the entire royal family. When King Juba died in 23 AD, he was buried in the mausoleum with his wife. Over the last two centuries, the mausoleum has been repeatedly ransacked and attacked by treasure seekers and military strongmen. Cleopatra and Juba’s human remains, in fact, were removed from the burial site long ago, most likely by looters. In 1555, an Ottoman admiral by the name of Salah Rais ordered the mausoleum destroyed. Upon entering the monument, however, Rais’ men were met with a massive swarm of black wasps, which promptly attacked and stung many of the would-be saboteurs. The attack was so fierce that several of the men actually died from their stings. Seeing this as a sign that the mausoleum shouldn’t be disturbed, the project was abandoned. Many years later, the occupying French Navy used the site for target practice, resulting in some minor damage to the structure. In 1866, Emperor Napoleon III visited the mausoleum. Thoroughly impressed with the structure, he righted the French Navy’s wrongs and demanded that the building be preserved and protected, allowing modern visitors a chance to wonder at the ruin and remember the life of a princess that may have otherwise been forgotten by time.  The mausoleum is formally part of the Tipasa Archaeological Site, located approximately 40 miles west of Algiers. It is best (and easily) reached by car. The entrance is fee is less than $1 USD. Note: when traveling from Algiers to Tipaza (the archaeological site is spelled with an ""s"" and the city is spelled with a ""z""), be sure to bring your passport and a copy of an accommodations booking, as police often set up roadblocks on the way to Tipaza and sometimes detain travelers lacking these documents."
1,Tipasa Roman Ruins,"Tipaza, Algeria","An extraordinary mix of Phoenician, Roman, early Christian, and Byzantine ruins beautifully set overlooking the Mediterranean.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tipasa-roman-ruins,"When you set foot in Tipasa, you see exactly why this plot of land has long been a prime piece of Mediterranean real estate. Among honeyed beaches, shady pine trees, and gently rolling hills, the sweeping turquoise sea serves as the backdrop for a layered history of golden ruins overlooking the coastal cliff. Colonized several times over between the 6th century BC and the 6th century AD, Tipasa originated as a trading center for the Phoenicians of Carthage. At that point, the city served as a port from which the population could buy and sell commercial goods with Greece, Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula. But not for long. Over time, the ancient settlement would variably fall under the rule of the Romans, early Christians, and Byzantines, each of whom used the territory as a trading post and/or a launching point for conquests into the kingdoms of Mauritania. A walk through the centuries of remodels and new additions at the site features a comprehensive Punic necropolis; ancient toilets; an amphitheater that saw gladiator throw-downs and naval battle reenactments; a second theater because, well, one entertainment venue is never enough; a Christian religious complex fitted with thermal baths, basilicas, and tombs; and, of course, the main streets of the once-bustling town center, which stretch directly out to the sea. Under Roman rule, a defensive wall was erected around the city to protect it from nomadic tribes, as the site became a serious military and commercial contender. The central location of Tipasa also enabled the Romans to build up their North African road system. Later, as Christianity spread, religious buildings did too, including the Great Basilica and the Basilica Alexander—focal points of Tipasa’s western section—while the Basilica of St. Salsa served those too lazy to walk over and attend mass from the eastern side of town. Alongside the folds of colonial ruins, monuments of the indigenous people of the area also stand. The most notable is the nearby royal mausoleum, Kbor er Roumia, which is the funerary monument of Berber King Juba II and Queen Cleopatra Selene II (Cleopatra and Marc Antony’s only daughter). Tipasa took a hit by the Vandal king Huneric in 429, who persecuted its Catholics, the remainder of whom fled for their lives to Spain. After this, the ancient city was abandoned, and although the Byzantines revitalized it somewhat in the 6th century, it fell into ruin shortly after. Tipasa has been called “one of the most extraordinary archaeological complexes of the Maghreb” by UNESCO. And it certainly is worthy of the title. Be sure to fill up on couscous before the trip!  The drive from Algiers to the Tipasa Archaeological Park is about 74 kilometers (45 miles), but a stop-off at the funerary monument of Kbor er Roumia will add a bit more mileage to your trip. Come with a tour, and you’ll probably be led by a rehearsed historical guide. Come on your own, and a knowledgeable local groundskeeper might take you under his wing, offering an off-the-cuff history lesson at no extra charge. Note that the ancient site of Tipasa, spelled with an ""s,"" is located in the modern city of Tipaza, spelled with a ""z."""
2,Sidi M'Cid Bridge,"Constantine, Algeria",This dizzying span over the ancient Algerian city was once the highest suspension bridge in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sidi-m-cid-suspension-bridge,"The Sidi M’Cid suspension bridge is the highest and most stunning of all the bridges in the Algerian city of Constantine, often called the “City of Bridges” thanks to its unique and picturesque geography. The 2,000-year-old city is located about 50 miles inland from Algeria’s Mediterranian coast, set on a high plateau split in half by a deep and dramatic gorge. A series of historic bridges span across the Rhummel River gorge that runs through Constantine, but the Sidi M’Cid Bridge is the most iconic—the highest link between the rocks that divide the city in two. Built in 1912, the Sidi M’Cid Bridge stands 575 feet (175 meters) high. At the time it was built, it was the highest suspension bridge in the world (surpassed by the Royal Gorge Bridge in Colorado in 1929). It dominates the gorge, offering an exceptional view over part of the city and valley beyond. This dizzying road bridge connects the Medina of Constantine to the university hospital center. The architectural design, a hybrid cable-stayed suspension bridge, gives it a similar look to another iconic monument across the Atlantic: the Brooklyn Bridge— although the Sidi M’Cid Bridge is more than twice as high.  The bridge is open for both cars and pedestrians. It is also easily reachable by Constantine’s gondola cable car, the téléphérique."
3,Tassili n'Ajjer,Algeria,The abstract sandstone rock formations at this Algerian national park are rich with prehistoric art.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tassili-najjer,"Just outside the desert oasis of Djanet, Algeria, there’s a national park brimming with pieces of the past. A trip through the alien-like landscape of Tassili n’Ajjer is like stepping into an open-air art gallery, where the sandstone rock formations become canvases for more than 15,000 prehistoric carvings and paintings. According to UNESCO, the park holds one of the world’s most important clusters of prehistoric rock art. The paintings and carvings offer a fascinating look at the animal migrations, changes in climate, and human life that helped shape the area’s history. The artwork is from the Neolithic period, back when this slice of the Sahara was a savanna teeming with wildlife like antelopes, giraffes, and crocodiles. You’ll find images of these creatures etched or painted onto the rocks. You’ll also find images of humans which act like a historical snapshot of daily life. In these, you’ll see people doing a range of activities like dancing, hunting, or handling their livestock. In addition to the art, Tassili n’Ajjer is worth exploring for its unique environment. The wind has sculpted the sandstone structures into beautiful, abstract shapes that tower above swathes of sand. Because of the nearby oasis, this part of the Sahara still boasts a considerable amount of life. Here, you’ll find endangered species of vegetation like Saharan Myrtle and Saharan Cypress. You may even catch a glimpse of a mouflon, a type of wild sheep that’s depicted in some of the early rock art."
4,Timgad,"Batna, Algeria",Classical ruins that remember ancient Rome's presence in Africa.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/timgad,"Located in the province of Batna, Timgad was an ancient Roman city built by the Emperor Trajan. It ceased to be inhabited after the 8th century. The triumphal arch, called  the “Arch of Trajan,” survived the test of time, and was finally renovated in 1900. The theater is also in good condition, and is still used for modern music shows. The city was added to UNESCO’s world heritage list in 1982."
5,Assekrem,"Tamanrasset, Algeria","A century-old stone hermitage overlooks this remote pass in the Hoggar mountains, surrounded by a landscape of eroded volcanic cores.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/assekrem,"In the middle of the Sahara lie the Hoggar Mountains, a brutal landscape of basalt buttes erupting from the barren landscape. In the heart of the Hoggar is a dramatic cluster of eroded volcanic cores overlooked by the 9,000-foot high Assekrem Pass. Part of the Ahaggar National Park, Assekrem is one of the many wonders of southern Algeria. It is located some 50 miles from the city of Tamanrasset. In 1911 Charles de Foucauld, a French soldier turned missionary, built a crude hermitage at Assekrem. De Foucauld spent most of his time in Tamanrasset, living closely with the Tuareg people and studying their language and culture. In 1916, he was assassinated as a suspected spy. He was beatified in 2005 and the hermitage is still tended today by aging monks from the order of Les Petites Frères de Jésus (the Little Brothers of Jesus), who were inspired by de Foucauld’s life and works. There is a lodge at Assekrem where visitors can spend the night to take in the stunning views of sunrise and sunset across the brooding monoliths from the plateau just above the pass.   These days access to southern Algeria is restricted, particularly in the province of Tamanrasset. You can fly there from Algiers in about 3 hours but will need the help of a local tour agency to get a visa and to organize the drive to the col, or lay on a camel trek which takes about a week."
6,Sacred Heart Cathedral of Oran,"Oran, Algeria",This former cathedral is now a bustling library packed with students and pigeons.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sacred-heart-cathedral-of-oran,"Colorful mosaic portrayals of Jesus and the icons of the Four Gospels shine out from the facade of the Sacred Heart Cathedral of Oran (Cathédrale du Sacré-Cœur d’Oran). Visitors who enter beneath the grand arch will find the organ, the chancel, and an altar adorned with crucifixes. But beyond those remaining vestiges, you won’t find anything else relating to Roman Catholic worship. Deconsecrated after Algeria declared independence from France, the secularized site has served as Oran’s public library since 1996. In spite of this, traces of the church’s original function remain and provide a remarkable contrast to the city’s other former religious sites (such as the Great Synagogue, which was converted into the Abdallah Ibn Salam Mosque). It’s well-worth joining the citizens of Oran who flock to the boulevard and the library to marvel at the mosaic facade and contemplate a structure that represents aspects of Algeria’s 20th-century history in microcosm—just keep your eyes out for pigeons overhead if you venture inside. Instead of religious services and a congregation, you’ll see shelves of books and documents in the chapel niches, and tables of students studying and socializing in what used to be the nave. Wander over to the chancel and apse areas of the ex-church, and you’re liable to encounter pigeons (and their poo). Of further note is the fact that the cathedral, constructed between 1904 and 1913, was the first church built out of reinforced concrete in the French overseas territories. The altar is, likewise, reinforced concrete and was therefore not blessed during the cathedral’s 1930 consecration as the material is not recognized by canon law. The cathedral also serves as the setting for several poignant scenes in Albert Camus’ novel The Plague.  As a public library visitors are free to enter and walk around."
7,Amguid Crater,"In Amguel, Algeria",One of the best-preserved impact craters on the planet is located in the middle of the Sahara Desert.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amguid-crater,"In a remote region of the Sahara Desert, an impact crater was punched into the land less than 100,000 years ago. Measuring some 500 meters (1,640 feet) wide and about 70 meters (230 feet) deep, the Amguid Crater is located in southwestern Algeria. On satellite imagery, the white spot of the flat, sandy crater floor is clearly visible; the residue formed by millennia of sporadic rain running into the bowl and evaporating. The first known record of the Amguid crater in scientific literature was made by the French explorer Roman Karpoff, who noted a possible impact crater from a plane in 1948. The French geologist Jean-Phillippe Lefranc visited the crater in 1969. The crater is almost perfectly circular, with steep walls and raised rims that are covered with large blocks of sandstone. Shallow canyons cut through the plateau from east and west and spill out into the Erg Bou Zerafa sand sea to the north. One of the canyon mouths at the waterhole of Aguelman Rahla, has an unusually high concentration of pre-Islamic tombs. Rock art, neolithic tools and other pre-historic relics suggest the entire region was occupied thousands of years ago when the Saharan climate was less arid. Amguid is the name of the nearest village (and army base) about 100 kilometers (62 miles) to the northeast.  The best way to get to the Amguid crater is on foot from the village of Arak on the trans-Saharan Highway. The 120-mile walk takes about 10 days so you'll need the services of a guide, cook and a camel caravan to carry provisions. There are waterholes along the way for replenishment (not all of them obvious), but no human habitation of any kind. Nor is it possible for a 4x4 to follow this route from the south. A 4x4 can get within 8 miles of the crater from the north, after leaving the trans-Sahara Highway midway between In Salah and Arak. It's a rough drive so it's best to leave the car at Aguelman Rahla and walk south over the plateau or follow the winding Oued Tafrekrek canyon, then climb up the side to the crater."
8,Martyrs' Memorial,"Algiers, Algeria",This massive monument towers over the city as a constant reminder of the lives lost during Algeria's hard-won war for independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/martyrs-memorial,"Opened in 1982 to honor the 20th anniversary of Algeria’s brutal and bloody war for independence, this impressive concrete monument is a testament to the country’s long struggle to throw off its French colonizers. The memorial rises 302 feet tall and is comprised of three soaring “palm leaves,” each punctuated at the base by a statue of a single Algerian soldier. In the center of the monument sits an eternal flame. The memorial was erected on the site on an old military fort on a hill in Algiers, allowing it to be seen up and down the capital city’s long and winding coastline. The memorial is free to visit (although soldiers will most likely prevent you from getting close to the eternal flame) and the surrounding plaza is a popular gathering spot. Entrance to the nearby military museum (Musem de l’Armee), which is located at the opposite end of the square, is free to enter and has a wide collection of exhibits that provide more context on Algeria’s complicated relationship with France.  The memorial can be easily reached via a small public cable car, which runs up the hill and connects the monument to the Botanical Garden Hamma (Jardin d'Essai du Hamma)."
9,Opera d'Alger (Algiers Opera House),"Algiers, Algeria",A new landmark that fosters cultural exchange between traditions.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/opera-dalger-algiers-opera-house,"This stunning opera house, a gift from the Chinese government to Algeria, opened to the public in 2016. The huge, rectangular building, reflected by a shallow pool just outside its doors, opens to an ornate greeting hall with floor-to-ceiling windows and a massive spiral. At an impressive 35,000 square meters, the venue can hold 1,400 seated guests. China and Algeria have a long economic relationship, the roots of which emerged in China’s support for Algeria’s independence struggle in the 1950s. Their continuing alliance is memorialized by the $40 million dollar project that started construction in 2013, just 11 years after the end of Algeria’s civil war. The nearby historic Théâtre National Algérien Mahieddine Bachtarzi, constructed between 1850 and 1853, was also once known as the Algiers Opera House, but is now better known as the National Theater. The Algiers Opera House hosts festivals, concerts, conferences, and other events. International artists and Algerians alike perform at the venue, including the Symphony Orchestra, the National Ballet and the Andalusia Music Group. This facilitates many opportunities for cultural exchange, such as the U.S. State Department-funded OneBeat Sahara music residency, which recently brought 25 musicians from North Africa and the United States to publicly perform at the opera house as a finale to 12 days of music exchange. After two pandemic-impacted seasonal closures, the opera house is open for regular programming. Their Ramadan program for April 2022 features about 150 artists collaborating in 17 separate performances over the holy Islamic month alone. Ongoing artistic workshops and operatic training are offered to young people and students looking to engage in the artistic community of Algiers.  Visitors can tour the opera house at their leisure, as long as performances or special events aren’t in progress. Students and adults 65 and over usually qualify for discounted tickets, and the opera doesn’t allow children under 5 to attend performances. Masks are currently mandatory due to the Covid-19 pandemic."
10,Cemitério de Navios (The Ship Cemetery),"Panguila, Angola",Abandoned ships along a deserted beach feel like the set of a post-apocalyptic thriller.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cemiterio-de-navios-the-ship-cemetery,"About a 30-minute drive north of Luanda, Angola, is an otherworldly sight: A barren beach with as many as 50 rusting ships on or near the shore. It’s like being on the set of a post-apocalyptic Hollywood thriller. Some of the ships are close enough that you can wade out to them at low tide, while others are further out with not much more than a rusting bridge or masthead above the surface of the ocean. The spot is officially known as SãoTiago Beach, near the town of Santiago. But the locals call it cemitério de navios, or the ship cemetery. A few like to call it “Marx Beach,” after the Karl Marx, one of the largest ships there. There are a number of stories as to the background of the ship cemetery at São Tiago Beach. Some say that prior to the construction of the Port of Luanda, Santiago Beach was the spot where ocean-going freighters would offload cargo bound for the country’s capital. According to this narrative, the spot was not ideal and many ships blew or were washed aground during storms or heavy seas. When the Port of Luanda was opened after the end of the Angolan Civil War in 2002, the ships that had run aground were simply abandoned. Others say that the spot has been a designated ship cemetery since the 1960s. Damaged or derelict vessels were towed to what was, at the time,  an uninhabited stretch of beach and left to rust away. According to the locals, some of the ships at SãoTiago Beach were damaged or destroyed during the war. In any case, the ships at São Tiago Beach were put or left there intentionally, which makes the place a true ship cemetery despite the varied accounts of its origins. Reaching this spot typically requires access to a vehicle and the help of a local who knows the area, as it is not a well-known attraction at this time. Sao Tiago Beach is located near the town of São Tiago, about a 30-minute drive north of Luanda. As you cross the border from Luanda into Bengo Province, there are a number of turn-offs to the left just south of town, nearly all of which will eventually lead to the beach.  At this time there are no tourist services or infrastructure in the area. You should bring whatever you’ll want to eat or drink as there is nothing available on-site. There are reports of some tourists being robbed at São Tiago Beach, and it is not advisable to go there alone or after dark. The most common point of access to the beach is here. Park near the nondescript concrete structure just above the high-tide line. The ships are directly in front and scattered along the coast in either direction. The site is quite expansive, stretching more than 2 km along the beach, so plan on at least an hour or two to see all of it."
11,The Iron Palace,"Luanda, Angola",Did Gustav Eiffel design this enigmatic metal building?,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-iron-palace-luanda-angola,"You might not know it from the outside, what with the loud, yellow paint job, but Angola’s Palácio de Ferro (Iron Palace) is made almost entirely of iron, and if the rumor is to be believed, it was the work of Gustav Eiffel. The true origin of the two-story building now known as the Iron Palace may be lost to time, but its arrival in Angola seems to have been just plain bad luck. Built some time in the late 1800s, the metal edifice is thought to have shown up on the Skeleton Coast after the ship carrying its prebuilt parts drifted off course and was claimed by Portuguese authorities. While there is no official record, it is believed that the building had been designed and built in Paris by the same man who created the Eiffel Tower. At first the building was used as a cultural center, but eventually it was abandoned and began to rust away in the humid air. For decades, the palace was neglected and began to deteriorate. However the building was revamped and repaired in the 2010s with the help of a diamond company as well as municipal funds, reopening its doors to visitors in 2016. But the work isn’t done yet, as no one has yet decided how the building is to be used. The two options on the table now are for the building to be used as a diamond museum or as a huge restaurant. Either way, we might never truly know whether we have Gustav Eiffel to thank."
12,War Remnants of 'Operation Protea',"Xangongo, Angola",The abandoned tanks along this highway are all that remain of a deadly conflict.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/war-remnants-of-operation-protea,"In the early 1980s, Xangongo was home to a complex of supply bases and training facilities under the South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO). In late August through early September of 1981, the entire area came under intense attack by the South African Defense Force (SADF) in what was known as “Operation Protea.” It was a dramatic battle of the Angolan Civil War and the South African Border War. The Angolan conflict officially ended in 2002, and in the intervening years most of the war remnants across the country were removed, and in some cases replaced with monuments. Cunene Province and Xangongo in particular, are the exceptions. Throughout Cunene are the remains of military vehicles destroyed or disabled during the war. Locals who have lived in the area since the 1980s, and veterans of that period of the Angolan war confirm that the tank and convoy remains in Cunene are, in fact, from Operation Protea. There is a small, nondescript monument to the lives lost in the conflict near the center of Mongua, a tiny town roughly midway between Onjiva and Xangongo. These days, most of what’s left are simply rusted out hulks along the roads of Cunene. They slowly sink beneath the windblown sand as silent, brooding testimonies to the battles that once raged around them. Some sites are eerily abandoned, with no signs that anyone has been there in ages. While you can find abandoned war vehicles throughout Cunene, most are concentrated along the main road between Onjiva and Xangongo. There are also several fairly intact tanks on the roads between Onjiva, Namacunde, and Nehone.  To get there: The provincial capital of Cunene, Onjiva, is the best starting point. There are direct flights from Luanda a few times per week, or it's a short drive in from the border of Namibia. From Onjiva, take the road to Xangongo. You'll start to see rusted remains, intermittently on either side of the road shortly after you pass the Onjiva airport just before the town of Xangongo. If you have time, check out some of the other roads around Onjiva as well for less visited sites. Safety: Most of Cunene was declared clear of landmines and ""explosive remnants of war"" (EWR) in the late 1990s. However, you should be very careful when visiting war remains in what were once obvious battlefields. Stay on obvious paths and roads, follow the advice of any locals, and of course never touch or pick up anything that might be live ammunition, bombs, or mines."
13,Miradouro da Lua (Viewpoint of the Moon),"Belas, Angola",This striking otherworldly landscape outside Angola's capital city is the product of millions of years of erosion.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/miradouro-da-lua-viewpoint-of-the-moon,"About 25 miles outside Angola’s capital city of Luanda lies an otherworldly landscape. Erosion from wind and rain over thousands of years has carved canyons and ridges out of weathered rock just footsteps off the main road. Miradouro da Lua, Portuguese for “Viewpoint of the Moon,” shows off different colored strata of rock that wrap around an expansive panorama. From the cliffside, you can see the unusual rock formations that diminish in size as they stretch to the sea. This is known as a karst landscape, which forms from slowly dissolved limestone and other semi-soluble rocks. The actual topography spans a few miles, following the same cliffs that separate the main road from the beach, but Miradouro da Lua is the best location to see the full splendor of the moon-like landscape. The sharp ravines and striking geography are best viewed at sunset, when the fading sunlight paints them a bright, gleaming red. Miradouro da Lua’s beauty was further immortalized in the final scene of a 1993 film of the same name that examines the relationship between Angola and its Portuguese colonizers through the story of one family.  You can reach Miradouro da Lua by following the Nacional Highway 100 about 25 miles on the way to or out of Luanda. Although you can opt to join an official tour, renting a car and driving on your own is just as simple, and much less expensive. There are a few restaurants by the beachside that you can drive down the cliffs to access, but the actual viewing site is right off the main road. Be sure to use GPS, since the sideroad has few sign markings and the entrance is easy to miss. Visitors are advised to watch their step when parking and photographing, as erosion has weakened the cliffside."
14,Ilha dos Tigres,Angola,"In 1962, the ocean severed this peninsula—and the village that sat on it—from the Angolan mainland.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ilha-dos-tigres,"Along the isolated coastline of the Namib Desert stands Ilha dos Tigres. Once home to a prosperous fishing village, housing a school, hospital, airstrip, and chapel, the island is now nothing but skeletal ruins jutting out of the sand. It was established in the 1860s by fishermen from Portugal. The settlement lasted for almost a century, with its final inhabitants relocating in the 1970s. Ilha dos Tigres sits upon is a strange piece of land. Over the years its shape and the tidal currents have caused it to become linked to the mainland, then back into an island periodically. It has been in its current island state since the 1960s, when a large storm came through the area, also destroying the pipe that supplied the village with drinking water. The civil war caused its eventual complete abandonment. Currently, the ruins of the village still stand, isolated and largely ignored, as they are incredibly difficult to access."
15,Ganvie Lake Village,"Cotonou, Benin",Africa's Venice on stilts.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gavie-benin,"In colonial Brazil, runaway slaves and free natives formed communities deep within the Amazon as a means of escaping the brutality of Portuguese slavery. A combination of dense vegetation, waterways, and perilous wildlife and disease separated these societies from the slave traders who pursued them. A small group of people outside of what is now Cotonou, Benin, took advantage of a different set of circumstances to evade capture by the Portuguese. At the time, the powerful West-African Fon tribe was hunting and selling other native tribesman to the Portuguese. While there were few physical impediments protecting the ancestors of today’s Ganvie village from outside attack, Fon religious practice forbade their raiders from advancing on any peoples dwelling on water, laying the groundwork for the Ganvie Lake Village. Ganvie is a village of roughly 20,000 people that stands on stilts in the middle of Lake Nokoue. The founders of the village fled there to avoid Fon warriors, and in the roughly 500 years that have passed since, Ganvie has developed an intricate and prosperous culture within the constraints of life on the lake. A school is the only one of Ganvie’s 3,000 buildings that exists on land, although a cemetery mound is currently under construction. The villagers of Ganvie travel almost exclusively by boat, and the few domesticated land-animals they maintain live on plots of grass that spring up from the water. Without a good supply of domesticated animals, Ganvie relies on a complicated network of underwater fencing to corral and farm various fish populations. The village sits several miles from the nearest shoreline and is about a 4 hour journey from the capital. Ganvie is Africa’s largest lake village. The easiest way to get to Ganvie is to take a boat from the Hotel du Lac in Cotonou. It makes the trip in about 50', what would allow one to full make a visit in about 1/2 day."
16,La Porte du Non-Retour (The Door of No Return),"Ouidah, Benin",A monument to the more than one million enslaved Africans deported from the port of Ouidah.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/door-of-no-return,"Over the course of two centuries, more than one million enslaved Africans were deported from the town of Ouidah on the coast of Benin. They were marched in chains from the town’s slave market to the nearby port, where they would board ships to unknown destinations, the majority of them never to return.  They were often blindfolded, and marched in circles around the few trees or few obstacles along the way, to make them forget where they came from, surely physically so they wouldn’t try to escape, as well as symbolically.  Today, a memorial arch, known as La Porte du Non-Retour (The Door of No Return), stands on the beach, a monument to the horrors of slavery. The massive slave trade in Benin was a cooperative effort between African rulers and private merchants. From the 1580s to the 1720s, the coastal Kingdom of Whydah exported around 1,000 slaves a month, many of them taken captive during tribal wars in the interior. These enslaved men were then taken to Ouidah, where they were sold to European and Arab merchants. This practice continued with the Kingdom of Dahomey, which conquered Ouidah in 1727, up until the end of the slave trade in the 1860s. From the slave market in Ouidah, the enslaved Africans had to walk a few miles to the coastline, where ships waited to take them away, to Jamaica or Brazil or some other unknown destination.  Small rowboats would take them out to the larger ships, and some would jump overboard in the rough water rather than face the uncertainty of the voyage or the life ahead.  For most, the beach at Ouidah was the last sight of Africa they would ever see. In the early 1990s, the Beninese government, with help from UNESCO, began a project to commemorate the victims of the slave trade. The Slave Route Project, as it was known, led to the creation of a series of statues, monuments, and installations beginning in the town and continuing along the dirt road to the beach—the final journey for so many enslaved Africans before they were deported. The largest and most impactful memorial stands at the end of the Slave Route. This is the Door of No Return, a memorial arch, or gateway, built in 1995. Both sides of the arch are covered in images of enslaved men and women. The main mural on the inland-facing side depicts enchained men walking toward the sea, a ship waiting for them in the distance. On the sea-facing side, the mural shows them walking away from their homeland, a single tree in the distance representing the land that most of them would never see again. Bronze sculptures stand at either side of the arch. Some represent the enslaved Africans: oxidized bronze figures in chains, staring out at the sea. And nearby stands a cement Egungun, a traditional masked figure that recalls departed ancestors. It’s a powerful collection if images, and—at least in some way—expresses the final thoughts of the enslaved men and women as their feet sunk into the sands of coastal Ouidah, and of Africa, for the very last time.  The Door of No Return is located on the beach about three miles south of Ouidah. The Slave Route runs from the town to the Door of No Return, with various statues and monuments—some now faded or damaged—along the route. Ouidah is a city on the coast of the Republic of Benin, about 45 miles west of the capital Porto-Novo."
17,The Temple of Pythons,"Ouidah, Benin",Dozens of snakes are housed and worshipped within the walls of this Vodun temple.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-temple-of-pythons-ouidah-benin,"A snarl of snakes forms a knot in the corner of a nondescript indoor pit. Other serpents slither around them. Though it’s an intimidating sight, in this African temple the powerful pythons aren’t feared but instead revered and worshipped. The Temple of Pythons is a site of historical and modern symbolism and spiritual practice in Ouidah, Benin. The snakes are a major totem for followers of Vodun, a religion practiced by groups of people within West and Central African nations such as Ghana, Togo, and Benin. Vodun became somewhat widespread in southern regions of the New World as a result of the African diaspora. It became the inspiration for other religions such as Louisiana Voodoo and Haitian Vodou. Snakes are important religious symbols and are highly respected. According to the theology, a rainbow serpent named Dan is an important deity that serves as a middleman between the living and the spirits. The serpents play a large role in the spirituality of Ouidah. According to local legend, the king of Ouidah took refuge in a forest from those seeking to kill him during a war in the 1700s. When he was in hiding, pythons emerged from the forest and prevented him from being captured. To commemorate their role in his protection, he ordered the creation of three monuments. Ouidah’s Temple of Pythons is a concrete building topped with a clay roof. Inside, there’s a pit filled with dozens of snakes from a species known as the Royal python (notable for their docility) either slinking around or tangled together. It is reported that approximately sixty pythons make this temple their home. The snakes aren’t fed, though they are let out about once a week to prey upon chickens and mice. They occasionally make their way into local homes, where they’re treated as ordinary guests before being returned to the temple. The snakes are harmless and visitors are permitted to hold them. For an extra fee, people can even take photographs with the slithering star attractions."
18,Agongointo-Zoungoudo Archaeological Park,"Bohicon, Benin",This subterranean town of over 50 dwellings lies thirty feet beneath the Earth's surface.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/agongointo-zoungoudo-archaeological-park,"Just outside of Abomey, a subterranean town of over fifty dwellings lies thirty feet beneath the ground. Known as the Agongointo-Zoungoudo Underground Town, the series of rooms and passageways was rediscovered in 1998 during a construction project in Bohicon, when an unsuspecting bulldozer toppled into one of the caverns. The sprawling subterranean town is believed to date back to the late-16th or early-17th century during the reign of King Dakodonou, the second king of Dahomey. Agongointo-Zoungoudo consists of over 17 acres of underground homes—each segmented into living rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens—likely erected to shelter warriors. Some of the underground dwellings contain multiple levels, and several appear to have been connected to a well. The underground town was designated a tentative UNESCO World Heritage site just four months after its discovery, and Bohicon authorities quickly worked to transform the site into an archaeological park open to the public. In addition to the underground town, you can check out the site’s butterfly garden, exhibition hall, and spots of local Vodun belief, such as a baobab tree wrapped in strangler fig and Dan fetishes.  The archaeological site is open each day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and the entrance fee is 2,000 CFA for foreigners. Please note that wearing red is prohibited."
19,Gcwihaba Caverns,Botswana,Wondrous stalactites house thousands of bats in these African caves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gcwihaba-caverns,"Far off the beaten path, accessible only 4x4 in fact, are Botswana’s Gcwihaba Caverns, a fantastical series of caverns filled with stalactites, stalagmites, and bats. Thousands of bats. Once a potential explorer reaches the isolated Gcwihaba Caverns, it is not a challenging descent in terms of spelunking, but it has unique challenges of its own.  Even the Botswana tourism website warns to be prepared for a storm of flying mammals if you make too much noise. The main chamber of the dolomite caves, named Drotsky’s Cavern after the the first European to be shown the cave in 1934, is a massive clearing in the stone in which bats hang from all the walls. The cave systems are home to at least three distinct species of bat, all of which are harmless, but all of which inhabit the caves in force. Archeological artifacts have also been found in and around the caves, suggesting that they were once used as shelter for prehistoric man."
20,African Quadripoint,"Chobe, Botswana",There is only one place in the world where the corners of four nations come together.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/african-quadripoint,"There are a number of instances where the borders of two or three nations touch, but the rare confluence of a total four nations coming together on one spot only exists in Africa where the corners of Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Namibia meet. Unlike the touristy spots where states come together in America, which are usually decked out with monuments and bronze medallions, the African quadripoint sits in the middle of a river that cuts between the countries. It has been theorized that the point is not a true quadripoint but instead a pair of tri-points separated by thin strips of real estate. Regardless of the quibbling, the obvious jurisdictional headache of having four countries so close to one another has resulted in some conflict. At one point the ferry that carried people across the river from Namibia to Botswana became a point of contention, with both countries laying claim to the transport. A small amount of fighting broke out but it was rather subdued for an international incident. While many maintain that slight changes in the flow of the Zambezi river and the exact geographical borders have eliminated an actual quadripoint, the countries are all so close that the only difference is academic."
21,Kubu Island,"Mmatshumo, Botswana",An enchanting rocky island of scraggly baobabs surrounded by an ancient sea and sprawling salt pans.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kubu-island,"Rising like the grey-colored humps of hippo wallowing in muddy water, Kubu Island is a fitting name for the mounds of rock that lie almost smack bang in the middle of Botswana’s Makgadikgadi Salt Pans. “Kubu” is the local Setswana word for hippopotamus and besides describing the island’s physical characteristics, the local lingo for this popular off-roading destination also alludes to its surprising watery history. Although the rocky outcrop is roughly 30 feet high, the summit of Kubu Island is enough to offer panoramic views across the vast plains surrounding it. Turn in a 360-degree circle and you cannot see any other civilization, only an infinite white horizon. This total lack of human habitation also makes this great white space a top location for uninterrupted stargazing. Geologically speaking, these sprawling salt flats bear proof that this was once a prehistoric lake. The water that now feeds the Okavango Delta, all the way from Angola in the north used to spill over here, but tectonic activity shifted the waters away leaving today’s travelers with the only desert. Look closely at some of the seemingly whitewashed rocks. Experts say this is actually fossilized guano from waterbirds that once perched along the edge of the Great Makgadigadi Lake.  Kubu Island and the pans surrounding this enigmatic anomaly in the otherwise sparse landscape is only accessible in a 4-wheel drive vehicle. You can access the island via Gweta, north of the Makgadigadi Pans, or via Lethlakane, in the south. Take off-road navigation with and ask for directions from somebody familiar with the area. You can camp below the baobabs at Kubu Island by making a booking with the Gaing O Community Trust, who are the custodians of Kubu Island National Monument and campsite in Sua Pan. Take everything you need to be self-sufficient. There is no water or firewood and only very basic long drop ablutions. Be respectful. The island is still largely considered a sacred place by locals."
22,Makgadikgadi Salt Pans,"Tutume, Botswana","Spanning over 10,000 square miles, this ancient salt pan is one of the largest on the planet.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/makgadikgadi-salt-pans,"Before the last ice age, Lake Makgadikgadi covered a large area in what is now northern Botswana. Fed by the Nata and Boteti rivers, this lake had no natural outflow. As a result, salts gradually built up in low-lying areas. Then, nearly 10,000 years ago, the climate in southern Africa changed significantly, and the lake dried up, leaving behind a series of salt pans covering over almost 10,000 square miles, making the Makgadikgadi pans arguably the largest network of salt flats in the world. The pans are vast, desolate, and inhospitable. Still, life persists. They are one of two breeding spots for flamingos in southern Africa, and summer rains briefly flood the pan and bring a variety of wildlife to the previously lifeless plain.  While the pans are a “salty desert,” where only certain types of algae can be found, there are grasslands and shrubbery surrounding the area.  Archaeological evidence suggests that early homo sapiens may have even resided in the area for a while, although it is hard to imagine how, or if, they thrived there. The pans also served as a major obstacle to missionaries pushing north in Africa. Still, despite the interactions different people have had with the pans, the Makgadikgadi salt flats remain relatively undisturbed.  The salt pans are very inhospitable, and so human interaction has been minimal in comparison to other natural salt sources across the world. There are threats to the pan though.  In 1991, commercial operations to extract salt began, and there were plans made to divert water from the Nata River for irrigation, something that would cause a severe threat to the small and unusual (but not unimportant!) ecosystem. The pans are located in Makgadikgadi National Park and Nxai Pan National Park, both immediately off the A3 from Francistown to Maun. The pans are most commonly visited from the village of Gweta, but can also be accessed from Nata or the town of Maun. Tours are widely available from all three locations, but a self-drive with a 4x4 is easy. Baines Baobabs can be accessed from the gate of Nxai National Park, and Chapmans Baobabs are 20 kilometers in on the Gweta-Orapa track. Note that if you venture off the main road in the pans, death is a distinct possibility. The vast, unchanging landscape has trapped visitors before. Be familiar with off-roading and navigation if you attempt this by yourself."
23,Matsieng Footprints,"Kgatleng, Botswana","Local legend has it that the first humans were created in the pools here, leaving their footprints behind in the rock.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/matsieng-footprints,"The creation story told among the peoples of what is now southeastern Botswana involves a great hunter named Matsieng. Some versions say he was a one-legged giant; other versions say he had two legs. All versions, though, describe how he emerged one day from a waterhole, followed by his animals and then by his people, and strode off with them across the wet earth to settle the surrounding lands. The Matsieng Footprints are a petroglyphic record of this cultural tradition. The footprints are located on a flat expanse of sandstone with several large natural holes that act as excellent basins for collecting rainwater. Thus, humans have been visiting the site frequently for millennia to fill vessels or water their livestock. Over time, the soft sandstone has accrued a collection of some 170 carvings depicting human feet (gigantic and non-gigantic alike) as well as animal feet (frequently feline) and animals in profile (such as giraffes). These petroglyphs— dating from 3,000 to 10,000 years ago—represent the impressions Matsieng and company left on the soft, unformed early earth as the emerged from the waterholes, designating the place as a creation site in local folklore. Many of the carvings have been worn down by exposure to the elements and regular watering of livestock, which was only recently discontinued. It remains an important ritual site, particularly for conducting rain-making ceremonies. The site is a 30-minute drive from downtown Gaborone north on A1, about 10 km past the village of Rasesa. A new road sign, immediately after Rasesa, marks the site, and you need to drive a short distance on dirt roads to find it."
24,Kebokwe's Cave,"Molepolole, Botswana",The historic cave is both a symbol of superstition and black magic and inspired one of the early Christian converts in Botswana.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kebokwes-cave,"Kebokwe’s Cave (Legaga la ga Kobokwe in Setswana) plays a dual role in the mythology of Botswana: It is both a foreboding symbol of superstition and black magic, but also as an essential part of the founding of Christianity in the country. The cave is perched in the hills overlooking the village of Molepolole on the Thamaga Road. Local legend states that it was an execution site for practitioners of black magic, who were pushed off the execution rock nearby, though historians think this is unlikely. So the story goes, a witch named Kebokwe was thrown from these rocks and used her magic to land unharmed. Since that time, dark spirits taking the form of giant snakes have haunted the cave and the surrounding hills. Regardless of its veracity, this legend was alive and well when David Livingstone, the famous physician, missionary, and explorer, arrived in Kolobeng in 1847. He convinced the Kgosi of the Bakwena, Sechele I, to convert to Christianity by spending a night in the cave to prove that the spirits could not harm him. After a restful night, Sechele became Livingstone’s only convert to Christianity. These days, the cave serves as a curiosity spot for tourists, and a pilgrimage for the faithful in Botswana. After turning off the highway, there is a 15 minute scramble up a well-used path to the cave. A Botswana Heritage sign marks the beginning of the path. The approach is littered with the remains of candles from midnight prayers, and the cave itself is rather small, but always cool with a breeze coming from deep in its chambers. From the nearby execution rocks, there is a view of the bush in the direction of Thamaga and Kanye. Finally, there is a clearly-marked sign designating the cave and parking area. Driving from Gaborone, after arriving in Molepolole on the A12, turn left on the Thamaga Road (F11). Drive about five minutes. After leaving town, you will see the hills and the cave on your right. There is an orange sign labeled Kebokwe Cave pointing to your right. It's rather small, so you can also use the much larger sign for Moleps Poultry as a landmark. Almost immediately you will see a gravel parking area with a Botswana Heritage sign marking the beginning of the trail. From here it is about a 15-minute hike, with some scrambling at the top. If you have trouble finding the place, the locals of Molepolole will be more than happy to direct you. While you're in town, you should also check out the Kgosi Sechele I museum, which discusses the history of the Bakwena and the town, as well as the cave. It is housed in the colonial era police station, located right before the turn to the cave on A12."
25,The Three Dikgosi,"Gaborone, Botswana",This trio of bronze giants celebrate the influential trip to Britain that led to Botswana's independence.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-three-dikgosi-gaborone-botswana,"Standing proudly in a Botswana square, the trio of massive bronze figures known as the Three Dikgosi forever look out across the country whose independence they helped maintain. In 1885 three tribal chiefs representing the people of Botswana, Sebele I, Bathoen I, and Khama III, traveled from their African nation to plead with the Queen. At the time Botswana (then the Bechuanaland Protectorate) was in danger of being incorporated in the exploitative British South Africa Company, and the tribal leaders set out to do something about it. Traveling to Britain, they pled their case and the nation was put under the control of the crown. It was not exactly freedom, but it was more appealing than the alternative. However it was this separation that would later keep the country from being included in South African apartheid. While their role in Botswana’s history is a controversial one, the leaders were commemorated in 2005 with the Three Dikgosi monument. Each of the leaders is depicted in regal bronze, 18 feet tall. Their granite stands bear their names and informational plaques tell of their achievements. Adding to the controversial legacy of the leaders, the monument also drew criticism for the North Korean labor used in its creation."
26,Cour Royale de Tiébélé,"Nahouri, Burkina Faso","In this African village, the walls of the chief's compound are painted with beautiful traditional designs.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cour-royale-de-tiebele,"Tiébélé, which is roughly 12.4 miles north of Ghana’s border, is known within the small West African country of Burkina Faso for its sukhala, the elaborately painted walls of the houses and outbuildings within the community chief’s complex. The village is home to the Kassena ethnic group, which has lived in this area since the 15th century. The patterns on the buildings within the Cour Royale de Tiébélé, which are usually painted by women, are an important example of the Kassena cultural legacy. Traditional designs are created by hand in black, white, and red colors, with lacquer prepared from beans. Adorning the walls with these artistic creations is a community activity, with upwards of 15 women working on any given building. It isn’t just houses that receive this special treatment. Mausoleums for the dead are decorated too. The architecture of the buildings themselves is typical of the larger Gurunsi ethnic group. The walls are thick and have minimal windows, for defense against both people and climate. The buildings were historically created using soil, straw, and cow dung, though nowadays mud, brick, and stone are the more common materials of choice.  There is a direct bus to Tiébélé from Ouagadougou three times per week (Tuesday, Friday, Sunday), departing from the bus station Ouagainter."
27,Ruins of Loropéni,"Poni, Burkina Faso","These mysterious 1,000-year-old walls have revealed little about their past.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruins-of-loropeni,"These stone walls have stood for at least 1,000 years, towering above an otherwise flat territory. As of yet, the ruins have revealed little about their past, as much of the archaeological site has yet to be excavated. The walls that stretched around the 119,800-square-foot site once guarded a fortress. It’s believed the fort was used by the Lohron or Koulango peoples, who were part of the powerful trans-Saharan gold trade. The settlement reached its peak between the 14th and 17th centuries, which were toward the end of the trans-Saharan gold trade’s prime. The site was abandoned sometime in the 19th century, and has largely been left to nature’s whims. Already, bits of the settlement have been lost to time. Centuries of wind, rain, and bushfires have weakened the walls that remain. In 2009, the ruins of Loropéni were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It’s the first World Heritage Site within Burkina Faso, and it’s hoped this prestigious title will fuel some funding for further research and excavations."
28,Source du Nil,"Musenyi, Burundi","For millennia, explorers were obsessed with discovering the source of the Nile—is this small mountain stream really the answer?",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/source-du-nil,"In the lush mountains of Burundi, 70 miles southeast of the bustling city of Bujumbura, lies the southernmost source of the Nile River—maybe. There are, in fact, many sources of the Nile. But this mountain stream in Burundi is likely the southernmost source of the river, which cuts a winding course through several countries before it empties into the Mediterranean. Also, it has a pyramid. At around 4,100 miles, the Nile is the world’s longest river. It has three main tributaries: the White Nile, the Blue Nile, and the Atbara. In 1863, English explorer John Hanning Speke “settled” the question of the Nile’s source, claiming that the terminus was Lake Victoria. But many rivers flow into that reservoir, the two largest being the Nyabarongo River, which flows from Rwanda’s Mount Bigugu, and the Ruvyironza (later Ruvubu) River, which flows from Burundi’s Mount Kikizi. It was German explorer Burkhart Waldecker who tracked down this latter source. Waldecker identified the Burundi source on November 12, 1937. He had come to the Belgian Congo seeking asylum from Nazi persecution, and soon after became obsessed with finding the Nile’s source. It’s said that it took Waldecker four years to trace the nearly 4,350 miles between where the Nile empties into the Mediterranean and this source in Burundi. Both then and now, the Burundi source is only a tiny trickle of water flowing slowly down from a spring on Mount Kikizi. In the centuries before Waldecker arrived in Africa, other European explorers came searching for the source of the Nile. As early as 460 B.C., the Greek historian Herodotus guessed at the Nile’s origin. In the first century, the Roman Emperor Nero sent two centurions to lead an expedition in search of the river’s source. But the emperor’s death brought the expedition to an inconclusive end. In the early 1600s, two Spanish Jesuit priests explored some of the Blue Nile’s tributaries. Then, in the 19th century, explorers became even more obsessed with discovering the river’s true source. There was the Scottish physician David Livingstone, the aforementioned British army officer John Hanning Speke, and the Welsh-American journalist Sir Henry Morton Stanley, who undertook the expedition on behalf of King Leopold II of Belgium. It became somewhat anticlimactic once multiple sources were discovered. Nevertheless, when Waldecker located the source in Burundi, he erected a stela on the nearest mountaintop “to remind people of the glorious destiny of the river.” He later replaced that stela with a stone pyramid bearing a Latin inscription: “CAPUT NILI MERIDIANISSIMUM,” which roughly translates to “the southernmost head of the Nile.”  The pyramid is a few hours drive from Bujumbura, and there is a small parking lot at the site."
29,Gishora Drum Sanctuary,"Gishora, Burundi",This century-old site established by King Mwezi Gisabo preserves the art of Burundi's ancient drum rituals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gishora-drum-sanctuary-burundi,"Nestled in the lush, verdant hillside, just over five miles from Burundi’s capital, Gitega, is the Gishora Drum Sanctuary. Burundi’s last independent ruler, King Mwami Mwezi IV Gisabo Bikata-Bijoga, founded the sanctuary in celebration of a victory over the rebellious chief Ntibirangwa in the second half of the 19th century. Since its founding, the Gishora Drum Sanctuary has been a place to practice and teach specific ritual drumming techniques. Drumming in Burundi is an ancient practice that mixes combat-style dance, specific rhythms, religious rituals, epic poetry, all into one. Historically, drumming rituals were part of the enthronement of kings, agricultural sowing festivals, and funerals of kings and queens. The drums themselves have long been associated with royalty and specifically the monarchy. Local boys and men, known as Abatimbo who descend from the ancient lineage of Abanyigisaka, have always run the sanctuary. They are the descendants of religious leaders who held senior positions within the royal court. As a country comprised of many different clans, including the Abahanza, Abavumu, Abajiji, and Abashubi, the drums became a means to unite a diverse population across generations and families. A ritual dance performed with the royal drum, ingoma, was one way to unite the people and honor the royal family. The drums themselves are made using wood from sacred, rare trees, like umuvugangoma (Cordia africana), umurama (Bridelia atroviridis), and umusave (Markhamia lutea). It’s believed that when the drums are played, they invite the ancestors into the ritual and banish evil spirits. All drums have a name and purpose. At the Gishora Drum Sanctuary, there are two important drums that have never been played—Ruciteme (“the one for whom we clear the forest”) and Murimirwa (“the one for whom we cultivate”). Both names reflect the importance of farming, and the king’s association with the earth’s fertility. The sanctuary also has other drums known as Ingendanyi, or “retinue,” which are still beaten today. Burundi continues to foster the practice and ritual of drumming, and in 2007 the government passed a suite of laws and policies to protect the ancient art form. These laws include the protection of drum sanctuaries, like Gishora and other sites throughout the country. Today, members of the sanctuary participate in drumming sessions at the site as well as celebrations held on Burundi’s Independence Day (July 1) and other government ceremonies.  Gishora Drum Sanctuary is about a 15-minute drive north of Gitega. Certain tour companies, like Augustine Tours, also have partnerships with the Sanctuary and run tours that visit it."
30,Lake Nyos,"Menchum, Cameroon","Deadliest lake in the world suffocated over 1,746 people in one night.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-nyos-the-deadliest-lake-in-the-world,"“I could not speak. I became unconscious. I could not open my mouth because then I smelled something terrible … I heard my daughter snoring in a terrible way, very abnormal.... When crossing to my daughter’s bed … I collapsed and fell … I wanted to speak, my breath would not come out.... My daughter was already dead.” These are the words of Joseph Nkwain, who on August 21, 1986, survived one of the strangest natural disasters in history. Known locally as “the Bad Lake,” Lake Nyos, located in the Northwest Region of Cameroon, Africa, carried a folklore of danger, and tales were spoken of an evil spirit which emerged from the lake to kill all those who lived near it. This legend contained the memory of a very real threat. Lake Nyos was formed in a volcanic crater created as recently as 400 years ago.  Crater lakes commonly have high levels of CO2, as they are formed by the volcanic activity happening miles beneath them. Under normal circumstances this gas is released over time as the lake water turns over. But Lake Nyos is different: it is an unusually still lake, with little in the way of environmental agitation. Rather than releasing the gas, the lake was acting as a high-pressure storage unit. Its deep waters were becoming ever more loaded with gas until more than five gallons of CO2 were dissolved in every gallon of water. Pressurized to the physical limit, Lake Nyos was a time bomb. On August 21, 1986, something in the lake went off. It is unknown what the trigger was–landslide, small volcanic eruption, or even something as small as cold rain falling on an edge of the lake. Whatever the cause, the result was catastrophic. In what is known as a Limnic Eruption, the lake literally exploded, sending a fountain of water over 300 feet into the air and creating a small tsunami. But far more deadly than the water was the gas. Some 1.2 cubic kilometers of CO2 was released in roughly 20 seconds. This massive wave of deadly gas swept over the countryside. Villages near the lake had almost no chance of survival, and in nearby Nyos only six out of 800 survived. (Those who did survive mostly did so by quickly escaping to higher ground on motorcycles.) As the CO2 settled, every flame and fire was immediately extinguished, a sign of the doom descending all around Lake Nyos. The cloud spread far and wide, killing people who were as far as 25 km away from the lake. Nearby villagers who came out of their houses to find out what the sound they had heard was were overtaken by wafting clouds of gas and fell dead at their doorsteps. People taking naps were killed without their relatives even realizing anything had happened, as the gas settled on the ground with enough concentration to kill, but leaving those standing unaffected. In all, 1,746 people were killed. The villages of Nyos, Kam, Cha, and Subum were all but wiped out, and more than 3,500 livestock animals perished in a matter of minutes. The lake itself turned from a clear blue to a deep red, a change that was caused by iron churned up from the bottom, symbolic of the violence of the natural event. Since this disastrous event the lake has been monitored, and a simple degassing solution put in place. A pipe has been installed in Lake Nyos that runs to the bottom of the lake, allowing the gas to escape at a regular rate. Due to the pressurized nature of the gas, it creates a rather lovely CO2-powered fountain of water. However, this may not be enough. The lake is once again at CO2 levels higher than in 1986, and a natural dam on the lake is in danger of failing. This would cause the double disaster of both flooding and gassing simultaneously. Also worrisome is Lake Kivu, a lake over 1,000 times larger than Nyos and in a much more populous area. It has been shown to have a historical record of causing creatures in the lake to go extinct approximately every thousand years. Scientists believe that a volcanic disturbance could cause the same kind of event seen at Nyos but on a much, much larger scale. The only question is when. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places. Check out this episode about Lake Nyos."
31,Man & Woman Lakes,"Hauts Plateaux, Cameroon",Spirits from these lakes are said to produce the local weather and odd phenomena as they bicker between themselves.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/man-woman-lakes,"Just a few kilometers outside the town of Bangem, above the smaller town of Mbat is the peak Mount Manengouba, a dormant volcano with an expansive caldera at its peak. In the caldera’s plain are two deep, markedly different crater lakes: Man Lake and Woman Lake. Even at first glance, the lakes appearances and respective atmospheres provide a solid foundation for the traditional lore espoused by the local Bakossi people, standing as a testament to the ancient and profound bad blood running between Man and Woman Lakes’ spirits. The larger of the two, Woman Lake’s has a pristine accessible shoreline that provides fish, crab and water for the local herdsmen and their cattle. Woman Lake’s surface glistens in the sunshine as breezes ripple its waters. Standing in stark contrast is Man Lake. On the same sunny day, Man Lake’s surface remains flat, unreflective and opaque. Daily, its water color oscillates between black, green, and brown depending on the spirit’s mood. Man Lake’s shores are impossibly steep, preventing anyone from reaching its waters without falling. While bathing in Woman Lake is a common occurrence, bathing in man lake is reserved for ceremonies and spiritual men. Moreover, the spirit is said to protect his waters from disturbance, as nothing floats on the lake’s surface nor can rocks thrown from the rim (no matter how hard or accurately) reach its waters. It’s as if a field deflects all such attempts, though once fallen into, Man Lake’s waters provide no avenue for escape. Why Man Lake should be such a moody, and unforgiving spirit is unclear. Fights between Man and Woman Lakes’ spirits are said to produce the storms that roll off the mountain, blanketing Bangem and other nearby villages. Moto-taxi drivers for hire in Bangem will deliver you to the summit for a small fee (a few dollars American) in the morning, and pick you up at the time specified in the afternoon/evening after hiking your fill. Due to the steep nature of the climb, each moto-taxi will only be able to carry one passenger, even if one were game for three people on a small motorcycle."
32,The Slave Port of Bimbia,"Bimbia, Cameroon","Buried deep in the forest near Limbe, this little known slave port became the point of no return for 10 percent of enslaved Africans.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/slave-port-of-bimbia,"On the shores of the Atlantic, near the seaside city of Limbe, Cameroon, lies the Bimbia Bonadikombo community forest. In the 18th century, Bimbia was a slave trade port, where historians have confirmed that at least 10 percent of enslaved Africans passed through, before being forced onto boats sailing to Europe and the Americas. Although covered in overgrown bamboo, bush, and vegetation, the ruins of this coastal slave port are intact. From chains that are almost two meters long to the bells and bracelets still visible, the pain and hardships of those who were enslaved become even clearer. The pillars of the prisons still stand tall. Unlike the island of Gorée off the coast of Senegal and Cape Coast Castle in Ghana, this slave trading port off the coast of Cameroon is relatively unknown. In the late 1970s, only a small number of historians had identified the remnants of the site, discovered during work on the site of the baptist church dedicated to British missionary Alfred Saker. A little over 10 years ago, Dr. Lisa Aubrey, who was on Fulbright at the University of Yaoundé I at the time, began working with international journalist Alain Kenfack to conduct research on the significance and history of the site. Dr. Aubrey and her research team have been able to locate 166 slave ships that left the shores of Cameroon headed to the Americas. Her research also showed that many of those enslaved did not just come from the Limbe area, but also from the grassfields of inland northern and western Cameroon, going through tortuous routes. Little has been done to develop the site as a place where tourists can easily visit. A road leading to the site has still not been constructed and local tour guides have been trying to encourage more Cameroonians to visit the site. However, In 2017, the Cameroonian government declared it a National Cultural Heritage and have also been working towards making the historical slave port a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
33,Viana Desert,"Rabil, Cape Verde",Rolling sand dunes of the Sahara... in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/viana-desert,"In the middle of the Atlantic Ocean off of Africa’s western coast sits the island of Boa Vista, known for its marine life, traditional music, and something more unusual: a small patch of desert on the northwestern part of the island, formed by the accumulation of wandering sand grains from the Sahara. Great volumes of sand are continuously carried from the African continent towards the sea by trade winds. Much of this sand is deposited on Boa Vista because of its proximity to the mainland and the particular shape of the terrain. The resulting desert patch makes for an unlikely landscape on the island—rolling dunes of white sands interspersed with black volcanic rocks and very sparse vegetation. This small extension of the Sahara is protected by the Government of Cape Verde, which forbids the use of motorized vehicles and promotes the construction of stone walls to limit the movement of the sand dunes toward the coast."
34,Wreckage of M/S Cabo Santa Maria,Cape Verde,This ship carrying cargo and four church bells for the Catedral Metropolitana Nossa Senhora Aparecida ran aground in 1968.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wreckage-of-ms-cabo-santa-maria,"On the northern part of the island of Boa Vista you’ll find the wreckage of a Spanish cargo ship that ran ashore in the fall of 1968. The M/S Cabo Santa Maria was on its way to Brazil and Argentina loaded with a variety of cargo and a number of gifts. The most important gift: four church bells determined for the new cathedral in Brasilia. But they disappeared in deep water so the cathedral had to be opened without its belts (it was only in October 1977 when they finally were consecrated at the clock tower). Unfortunately, in the early morning hours of September 1, the ship ran aground on the coast of Boa Esperança. A tugboat was sent from the island of São Vicente to try to dislodge the ship, but to no avail. Fortunately, the crew was able to escape the scene unhurt. That left just one thing to deal with, and it was no small feat. A good part of the population of Boa Vista, children as well as public employees and machine operators from the other islands, were mobilized in order to remove the cargo of the ship. They used mules and donkeys to carry the cargo to the nearby capital of Boa Vista, Sal Rei. The unloading of the ship was carried out for nearly a year. Today, the ship is slowly crumbling. After almost 50 years of battering by the wind and constant waves, much of the deck and hold have disappeared, and only a rusty shell remains for the time being… but visibly not for long. Over the decades the shipwreck has become a symbol of the island and a source of inspiration for artists.  The site can be reached with a 4WD vehicle via a scenic rout of untouched nature. More adventurous visitors can get there on foot from Sal Rei (around 7 km)."
35,Curral Velho,Cape Verde,"Once a bustling fishing village and trading post, today these Cape Verde ruins provide a home only for seabirds and turtles.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/curral-velho,"The ruins of the old fishing village known as Curral Velho lie along the southern shore of the Cape Verde island of Boa Vista, the remains of the oldest settlement on the island. Translated from Portuguese, Boa Vista means “good view,” and Curral Velho means “old corral.” And both names are appropriate. The “good view” is unparalleled, and the “old corral” is pretty damn old, going back to the 17th century. Cape Verde is a collection of small islands, an archipelago about 300 miles off the coast of West Africa that was originally settled by the Portuguese. Boa Vista is the second largest island, but it’s still small — 240 square miles, or about the size of Chicago. There are roughly 8,500 people who live on Boa Vista full time, they are mostly there to service the growing tourism industry. The ruins of the old village of Curral Velho are spread out along the remote and vast stretch of beach known as Santa Monica (named after its more famous cousin in Southern California). The little village was remote even at the time it was settled, and life wasn’t easy for the inhabitants. Navigation around this side of the island was tricky, and fresh water could be scarce in times of drought. But the early inhabitants did have one other thing going for them besides fishing. There is a large salt flat nearby, and the export of salt to the mainland and to the other Cape Verde islands meant they had something to trade. This kept the village going for a couple hundred years, but in the early 19th century Boa Vista was sacked by pirates at least twice. The Boa Vistans fortified their vulnerable island, but the city they built as protection from further attack wasn’t near Curral Velho, and the little village was eventually abandoned. The area around the ruins is an important habitat for seabirds and sea turtles who have enjoyed the sleepy stopover for millennia, as a place to lay their fragile eggs. The rapid expansion of tourism has been a threat to both the eggs and to the turtles themselves, valuable for their meat. Efforts have been stepped up by environmental organizations to protect the wildlife, with some real success. They’ve been able to get both the seabird and turtle populations back up after years of decline. Which is only fair since the birds and turtles have been coming here long before any people showed up. The village is on the southern coast, about 15 miles (25 km) southeast of the capital Sal Rei"
36,Notre-Dame of Bangui Cathedral,"Bangui, Central African Republic","Amidst political unrest, this Roman Catholic Cathedral has helped organize peace talks.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/notre-dame-of-bangui-cathedral,"Built in the early 1900s, the Notre-Dame of Bangui Cathedral is a large red brick church built in the French colonial style. Above the three-door entrance is a white plaster icon of the Virgin Mary looking out from a niche. The interior of the cathedral features a crucifix and four massive windows featuring colored glass. The symmetrical double-tower design harkens back to Paris’s own Notre Dame Cathedral. Though today it has a population of nearly 900,000, the Central African Republic’s largest city was established as a small outpost in 1889. A 1906 decree transformed the small post into the French colony’s capital. Catholicism was introduced into the newly established colony around the same time, with the arrival of Monsignor Augouard in 1893. Augouard established the Saint-Paul mission, which opened its doors in 1894. A few years after that, the Notre-Dame of Bangui Cathedral was built in the center of the so-called “European city.” The cathedral, along with the majority of other religious buildings in Bangui, was constructed with fired bricks that are a reddish color. The Central African Republic is home to an estimated 2.9 million Christians today, about a third of whom are Roman Catholic. Many of these conversions happened when Catholic missionaries focused their efforts on the Central African Republic after World War I. Since declaring independence from France in 1960, the Central African Republic has experienced a series of conflicts. Political unrest in the 1990s prompted then-Archbishop Joachim Ndayen to begin hosting peace talks at the cathedral in 1996. Later in 1999, Pope John Paul II visited Bangui and spoke about the “difficult and complex situation” facing the country. Since 2012, the Central African Republic has been in the midst of a civil war spurred on in part by tensions between Muslim and Christian groups. In November 2015, Pope Francis visited the cathedral as well as the nearby Grande Mosquée de Bangui, offering a message of peace and resilience."
37,Grande Mosquée de Bangui,"Bangui, Central African Republic",This mosque is an enduring symbol of Central African Republic's rich Muslim heritage.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grande-mosquee-de-bangui,"Located in the Koudoukou neighborhood of the Central African Republic capital, the Grande Mosquée de Bangui is a white and green stucco building with three minarets and gold-painted star-and-crescents adorning its roofline. Large fans cool the interior and loudspeakers mounted onto the minarets announce the call to prayer five times a day. During particularly large gatherings, worshippers will overflow into the dirt path in front of the mosque arranging their prayer mats in neat rows. The spread of Islam in Africa spans more than a millennium. Beginning in the seventh century, Muslim Arabs made their way into North Africa. From there, Muslim traders continued to spread the religion throughout West and East Africa. What is now the Central African Republic was likely among the later regions for Islam to reach, perhaps beginning in the 17th century. Today, about 10 percent of the Central African Republic’s population is Muslim, nearly 570,000 people. Since declaring independence from France in 1960, the Central African Republic has experienced a series of conflicts. In 2012, a civil war erupted throughout the country, spurred on in part by tensions between Muslim and Christian groups. In April 2014, the Grande Mosquée de Bangui was looted after armed peacekeepers escorted many Muslims out of the conflict zone. On November 29, 2015, Pope Francis visited the Grande Mosquée de Bangui, as well as the nearby Notre-Dame of Bangui Cathedral. The mosque is in the PK5 district of the capital city, an area Christian militia groups have laid an ongoing siege to since 2013. Once inside the mosque, Francis preached a message of peace and harmony saying, “Christians and Muslims are brothers and sisters.” He concluded his address with the traditional Arabic greeting, “Salam alaikum!” or “peace be upon you.” Francis’s 26-hour visit to Bangui is the first time a pope has ever visited an active war zone."
38,Guelta d'Archei,Chad,Camels and crocodiles share the black waters of this stunning Saharan oasis.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/guelta-darchei,"The Guelta d’Archei is a guelta, or oasis, in the Ennedi Plateau in northeastern Chad. For centuries, caravans have stopped in the steep-faced canyon to water their camels. Every day, hundreds of camels can be seen drinking the black water of the guelta, their grunts and bellows echoing around the canyon walls. The mostly knee-deep water has turned black over the years due to the incessant supply of excrement offloaded by the thirsty camels. Not exactly the perfect place for a swim, then, unless you happen to be a crocodile. Crocodiles were once widespread throughout the Sahara until the early 20th century, when increased aridity combined with human persecution led to the extinction of many local populations. The best-known remaining population in Chad is found in the Guelta d’Archei, where West African crocodiles eat the fish that thrive on the algae-rich waters of the camel-dung fertilized guelta. Frogs also inhabit the guelta, and desert antelope can sometimes be seen drinking from the precious supply of water. With the exception of the daily camel herders, humans are scarce. Chad is one of the least visited countries in the world, and the oasis sits in the middle of the Sahara. But for those adventurous travelers who do brave the desert for a trip to the Guelta d’Archei, the reward is a surreal landscape in one of the Sahara’s most ancient oases, as attested by the rock paintings up on the cliffs, some of which date back to the middle Holocene.  The Guelta d'Archei is located in the Ennedi Plateau in north-eastern Chad, about 25 miles southeast of the town of Fada. Trips to the guelta can be arranged in the capital N'Djamena, but get ready for quite a voyage. It’s a four-day journey across the desert by 4×4 (or camel if you so desire), and then a few hours of trekking to reach the guelta itself. Alternatively, you can look for a flight into Fada and arrange a trip from there. Needless to say, be careful in or around the dung-blackened water. West African crocodiles are smaller and less aggressive than the closely related Nile crocodile, but they could still take a bite at a human."
39,Desert Lakes of Ounianga,Chad,These natural wonders have taken millennia to form into the stunning marvels they are today.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/desert-lakes-ounianga-ennedi-massif,"Eighteen lakes snake through the arid Ennedi region of Chad to form a breathtaking oasis in the middle of the Sahara Desert. Collectively they are known as the Desert Lakes of Ouianga, which make up the world’s largest permanent freshwater lake system in a desert environment. The first sketches of these lakes date back to 1913, when French colonizers launched a geographic mapping exercise of northern Chad. The exceptional flora and fauna that flourish here are rare, partly due to reduced evaporation of the water thanks to varying mineral composition and clusters of floating reeds. About 10,000 years ago, these lakes made up a singular water basin. That geological history contributes to the unique hydrological system that sustains the lakes in an arid climate that sees less than two millimeters of rain each year. This contained lake system is located in the Ennedi region of the Sahara, home to a nearby plateau called the Ennedi Massif. Here, striking sandstone arches and other freestanding structures tower over canyons and plains, alongside ancient caves. Human occupation of this desert region dates back to the Neolithic period, evidenced by archeological sites and ancient artwork. The Ennedi Massif was once a primordial ocean that covered part of what is now the Sahara Desert and dried up between 350 and 500 million years ago. Erosion by water, sand, and wind has sculpted canyons and valleys in the arid plateau that is roughly the size of Switzerland. Gorges and rock labyrinths are still home to small streams that have provided resources for generations of communities living in Ennedi Massif. Ancient petroglyphs dating back 7,000 years show the evolution of the land’s topography and animal life through paint and engravings. Around 30,000 semi-nomadic people now live within the Ennedi reserve’s borders, grazing livestock in oasis areas and continuing to steward the land their forebears relied on.  Visitors to Ennedi Massif and the Desert Lakes of Ouianga should anticipate booking a guided tour, due to harsh desert conditions. Tourism is not yet fully developed in Chad, so email tourismrnce@africanparks.org for details on visiting the Ennedi reserve."
