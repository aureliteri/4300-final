0,Palmyra,"Palmyra, Syria",Mysterious lost empire of the Silk Road.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palmyra,"Led by Queen Zenobia, a third-century ruler who was later taken to Rome and paraded through the streets in golden chains, Palmyra was a rich city on the Silk Road, a gateway to the West for travelers returning from the Orient. Under Zenobia’s rule, Palmyra actually took territory from the Romans–and the short-lived Palmyrene Empire stretched from Turkey down to Egypt. The empire lasted for thirteen years, and then Aurelian decided to take it back. He defeated the Palmyrenes and took Zenobia back to Rome, where she was accepted into society and eventually became a lively and much-admired Roman matron. In 1980, it was declared a UNESCO world heritage site. For most of the past few years, Palmyra was a small town with a large and lush oasis next to it; the ruins of the old city covered the plain for a good square mile. Beautiful Romanesque columns carved from the local golden sandstone marched down long avenues; in the early morning and early evening, the brilliantly blue sky contrasted strikingly with the warm tones of the stone and the long, deep shadows. It was an extraordinary place to visit, a reminder of a mysterious lost empire, worthy of pulp novels. Unfortunately, in May of 2015 the area fell under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Daesh), and its temples, monuments, and other buildings were subsequently blown up, razed, or otherwise destroyed. How much of it will remain after the conflict remains unknown. Inaccessible due to the ongoing Syrian Civil War"
1,Krak des Chevaliers,"Safita, Syria",Ruins of the Crusaders' headquarters.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/krack-des-chevaliers,"Krak des Chevaliers is the single most imposing symbol of the Crusades. The Krak is a massive Crusader fortress built during the First Crusade on a strategically important spot 40 kilometers from city of Homs or Hims, called l’Chamelle by the Crusaders, in the middle of the Syrian desert. What made this spot so strategic was that only one route led from the city of Antioch south to Beirut and the Mediterranean, and that route passed through Homs Gap. Krak des Chevaliers sits atop the 650-meter hill which dominates the surrounding countryside and overlooks this ancient highway. The Krak was originally a much smaller fortress, built by the Emir of Aleppo. In 1110, it was captured by Tancred, Prince of Galilee and one of the most famous Crusaders; the fortress later passed into the possession of Knights Hospitaller, the most powerful religious-military orders of the Crusades. The greatly expanded fortress served as their base of operations in the Middle East for centuries. Built according to the taste of its masters, Krak des Chevaliers is a typical example of Gothic architecture, uprooted from Western Europe and transferred to the Middle East. Even today, it is one of the best-preserved examples of European medieval military architecture. The fortress could accommodate a garrison of 2000 soldiers. The inner protective wall is over 3 meters thick. The inner castle is protected by seven towers, each 10 meters in diameter. The storeroom is 120 meters long and could hold supplies that would permit the defenders to survive a siege for about five years, with stables that could accommodate up to one thousand horses. Krak des Chevaliers withstood numerous attacks by Muslim forces, even a siege by the mighty Saladin in 1188. Legend has it that Saladin managed to capture the commander of the fortress and ordered him to make the defenders open the gates. Allegedly he did as he asked, speaking in Arabic, but then commanded in French that his men defend the castle to the last warrior. In the end, sheer force-of-arms was not enough to conquer these mighty walls. The castle fell to a cunning trick. In 1271, Baibars Mamluk, Sultan of Egypt, managed to take the fortress after sending a forged letter to the defenders in the name of their master and commander in Tripoli ordering them to surrender the castle. After their expulsion from Syria and Levant, the never-conquered (though easily duped) Knights Hospitaller moved their headquarters to Cyprus and then to Rhodes, retreating ever westwards, until they settled on Malta, where they survived until Napoleonic times as the Knights of St. John. Today, the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes, and of Malta has its headquarters in Rome. Although not territorial, the Order has a diplomatic status in many ways equal to that of a sovereign nation. It maintains diplomatic relations with many nations and issues its own own passports, currency, stamps, and even vehicle registration plates. Thankfully, the Order has reverted back to its humanitarian roots. Krak des Chevaliers is on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.  Buses from Homs, or minibus for Hama costs about 1$. Taxi from Damascus is about 60$ for the round trip."
2,Dead City of Serjilla,"Balshoon, Syria","A 1,500-year-old ghost settlement is slowly fading away.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/serjilla,"There were no dramatic events causing a mass exodus from Serjilla. No catastrophe befell the small farming town, and no earth-shattering natural disaster struck. There was a smattering of invasion and disease, but mostly, Serjilla simply melted away into the landscape, forgotten yet preserved in time. Known as the Dead Cities of Syria, a series of 800 small villages from the 5th century are remarkably preserved and give the world clues to life in a small Byzantine farming community. Serjilla is only 50 miles Southwest of Aleppo, and is one of the best kept of the Dead Cities. Founded in 473 C.E, Serjilla was a small but prosperous agrarian town. Like all the villages in the area, Serjilla produced olives, olive oil, grapes, wine and wheat. Fruitful trade routes ran through the area and the people lived a modest Christian life with little luxury or grand monument. Archeologists who have studied the area have pointed to this modesty as a defining characteristic of the city, and have viewed the town as an average farming town from 1500 years ago. In the 7th century, as the Umayyad dynasty began to gain power, trade routes shifted out of the area and the Dead Cities were slowly abandoned. There were some attacks during the time from Arab invaders. However, the migration from Serjilla and its neighbors was mainly based around economic concerns. Today, the ruins feature many structures of the ancient town, including a Christian church, two-story villa and a small building with an olive press. Although the city was not abandoned in chaos, the many have remarked on the eerie setting around Serjilla and the absolutely barren landscape that surrounds it.  Visitors can take microbuses or taxis from Aleppo"
3,Musyaf Castle,"Masyaf, Syria",The Syrian headquarters of alleged hashish-smoking assassins.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castle-of-musyaf,"The tale of the Hashshashin is well-known legend in the West. Basically it can be summed up as: they smoked hash, and they killed people. The name “Hashshashin” became synonymous with skillful murder and is the basis for the modern term assassin. While modern scholars suspect that the hash smoking part probably isn’t true – the name Hashshashin was probably an insult based on their true name, the Asasiyun or “foundation of the faith” – what everyone can agree on is that they definitely killed people. Many people and very skillfully. They did much of this killing from the Musyaf Castle. Situated on a 20 meter plateau the Musyaf castle imposes itself on the hilly landscape of Syria. The structure dates back over 2800 years to the Byzantine era and saw rule by Mamluks and Ottomans, but is remembered today by its darkest period. It’s towers and gates still stand as symbols of the violent force that was contained within its walls: home to the Hashshashin. During the 12th century, the Hashshashin cult was led by Rashid al-Din Sinan, also known as “the Prince of the Mountain.” A trained Hashshashin himself and a powerful Northern Syrian warlord, Rashid controlled and ruled over the trained killers. While Sinan held the fortress, he carried out numerous attacks on leaders around the region including the King of Jerusalem as well as against his mortal enemy Saladin the leader of the Ayyubids. In an attempt to kill Sinan, Saladin laid siege to Masyaf, nearly taking the castle. According to legend, (and in the writing of the sect itself) while Saladin slept in a tent beneath Masyaf, an assassin crept into his tent, leaving and a poisoned cake a note saying “You are in our power. ” Never has a cake been so terrifying. Scared to death, Saladin made peace with Sinan and left him in control of Masyaf. The assassins sect in Musyaf came to an end when they met an enemy as fearsome as themselves: the mongols. Today, the ruins can be visited from Hama only 60 kilometers to the East, for adventurers who dare cross into Assassin territory. There is an excellent open access “Description, History, Site Plan and Visitor Tour” of The Citadel of Masyaf, published by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, available for download via http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.jsp?document_id=10621"
4,The Citadel of Aleppo,"Aleppo, Syria",One of the oldest and largest castles in the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-citadel-of-aleppo,"This large fortified palace sits prominently in the middle of Aleppo, Syria. The citadel dates back to the 3rd millennium and has hosted several occupants such as the Greeks, Byzantines, Ayyubids, and Mamluks to name a few. The castle has been restored extensively over the course of its existence, but endured considerable damages during the Battle of Aleppo. It re-opened again in 2017, but still required additional repairs and restoration work."
5,Church of Saint Simeon the Stylite,Syria,"What is left of the pillar of Saint Simeon, the voluntary martyr who climbed the column to give his sermons, remaining perched there for thirty-seven years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-saint-simeon-stylite,"In the early fifth century, a Syrian monk named Simeon wandered out into the desert where he found, near modern-day Aleppo, an abandoned column rising up out of the sand. Simeon climbed the pillar, and would remain aloft on it for the next thirty-seven years (though he did eventually transfer to a much taller pillar nearby). From the pillar, he preached sermons to those who sought out his wisdom and his example, though history has not treated his vocation well. Edward Gibbon wrote of Simeon, “This voluntary martyrdom must have gradually destroyed the sensibility both of the mind and the body, nor can it be presumed that the fanatics who torment themselves are susceptible of any lively affection for the rest of mankind.” His odd life later became the subject of a scathing satire by Luis Buñuel, Simon of the Desert. He was not the only pole sitter (known as a “stylite”) but he was the first and the most famous, and after his death this church was built on the site of his pillar to honor his ascetic devotion. The church was huge, over 5000 square meters, rivaling Hagia Sofia in size, though it has long since fallen into ruin and now comprises only part of the large complex of ruins known as the Dead Cities of Syria. Saint Simeon’s pillar, surprisingly, still stands, though it’s been whittled down to just a few meters from centuries of relic seekers who’ve carved off small shards for themselves. located about 30 km (19 mi) northwest of Aleppo"
6,Souk al-Saqatiya,"Aleppo, Syria","Amid the rubble of Aleppo's Old Quarter, part of a historic market has been restored and re-opened.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/souk-al-saqatiya,"Before it became a 21st-century battleground, Aleppo’s historic Old Quarter embraced the world’s longest and oldest network of souks—Arabic for covered markets. There were 45 in all, dating back to medieval times and forming a 13-kilometer labyrinth where Syrians and foreigners came to shop, work, and socialize. Between 2012 and 2016, government and rebel forces fought for control of Aleppo, which was then Syria’s biggest city. By the time government troops regained control of the Old Quarter, almost all the souks and all but a hundred of their 1,600 shops had been damaged or destroyed—demolished by explosives, pitted by shrapnel, and charred by fire. Syrian authorities and foreign heritage organizations aim to bring the Old Quarter back to life by rebuilding the souk network bit by bit. One of the first sections to be restored is the Saqatiya souk, a 100-meter cobblestone alley containing 53 shops. Saqatiya means a seller of meat offcuts, and under the souk’s arched roof, vendors once again shout their wares, including fresh meat, nuts, sweets, clothing, and toiletries. Al-Saqatiya, sometimes spelled al Saqatiyah, re-opened in 2019 and is a short stroll from the 11th-century Great Mosque, Aleppo’s war-damaged spiritual heart. Reconstruction of the souk cost $400,000 and took about eight months, the Associated Press reported. The project employed about 60 workers and was funded and supervised by the Geneva-based Aga Khan Trust for Culture, which promotes the restoration of historic sites as a catalyst for social and economic development. Syrian architect Bassel al-Daher said about 30 percent of Saqatiya was damaged in the war. He told AFP that its reconstruction was “the project of a lifetime.” Aleppo’s location, midway between the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Euphrates River to the east, put it at the center of international trade for millennia. Long-distance caravan trains brought Persian silks, Indian pepper, and other valuable cargoes to the city. Products found their way west by way of European merchants who lived in Aleppo from at least the 16th century. They tapped into a multi-ethnic and multi-faith commercial network that stretched as far as China.  We currently recommend against travel to Syria. The U.S. State Department has issued a ""Do Not Travel"" advisory for the entire country, citing ongoing risks such as ""terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict."" Few international hotels are operating in Aleppo, and power rationing is in effect. The badly damaged Old Quarter is in the early stages of reconstruction, and largely deserted."
7,Deir Mar Musa al-Habashi,"An-Nabk District, Syria",This ancient mountain monastery welcomes all manner of faith in an effort to keep Christians in Syria.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/deir-mar-musa-al-habashi,"This ancient Catholic monastery houses world renowned wall frescos and promotes religious acceptance in a region ravaged by intolerance and war. The structure of Deir Mar Musa (The Monastery of St. Moses The Abyssinian) has had many incarnations since it was first built by the Romans in Byzantine times. Originally intended for use as a Roman watchtower to monitor and control illicit trade, it was repurposed as a medieval hermitage site, a Catholic monastery, and eventually it was left abandoned for several centuries until it was reclaimed in 1991 by a local Syrian-Catholic monastic community. The modern-day Catholic community is founded on the premise of religious tolerance. It works to convince local Christians to remain in Syria and to work with their Muslim neighbors to build a multi-religious community. It also embraces a wider audience, and any wandering traveler is welcome to enter the monastery and stay the night, so long as they participate in community chores and respect the monastery rules. While camouflaged among the burnt brown stone of the towering valley walls, the site itself remains an imposing edifice. The monastery is built high onto the mountains rimming the valley, and it takes 30 minutes of walking up a path of narrowly stacked stairs to reach the entrance gate. Each step creates a sensation of walking back in time, with only a single cable cord (used to transport food goods from the valley floor) marring an image that has remained largely unchanged in the last thousand years. However, the medieval ambiance is misleading, for inside the ancient stone walls is a community that has seamlessly woven both modernity and tradition into their lifestyle. Electric lights are turned on following the daily hour of silence, and the ancient rugs outside the chapel are piled with a mix of Nike athletic shoes and leather sandals. Inside the chapel, the Monastery’s leader preaches in a room decorated with 800-year old frescos of Christ, but uses translators to reach out to a modern congregation of international travelers on their iPhones. Deir Mar Musa is a beacon of hope in a war-torn country, and offers an inspiring layover for travelers who wish to better understand and appreciate the nuances of Syrian culture."
8,Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque,"Set Zaynab, Syria",This ornate mosque is said to hold the remains of Muhammad's granddaughter beneath its dome of pure gold.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sayyidah-zaynab-mosque,"This exquisite blue-tiled Damascus mosque houses the remains of Sayyidah Zaynab in a shrine adorned with crystal. It is a vitally important pilgrimage site for Shia Muslims who come to pay mournful respect to her remains. The Shrine of Lady Zaynab was built to honor the granddaughter of the Prophet Muhammad, and is believed by some to contain her remains. In 680 BCE, Lady Zaynab was captured and taken prisoner following the massacre at Karbala, one of the defining tragedies of the Shia religious tradition. While captive, she saved the life of her nephew, Ali, by throwing herself over his body and declaring they would have to kill her as well. Her bravery preserved the line of succession, ensuring the future of Shiism. As such, her shrine is one of the most important and emotional pilgrimage sites for Shia Muslims. The shrine itself is hidden in a maze of shops, hotels, and restaurants in southeast Damascus. Finding the mosque is a challenge that requires following crowds of black-robed Iranian pilgrims and the occasional glimpse of the towering blue minaret. The entrance gate opens onto a polished outer courtyard that is dominated by the shrine at its center and the entire edifice is adorned with intricate blue-tiled mosaics of symbolic flowers, geometric shapes, and Arabic script. The dome atop the shrine is made of pure gold, as are the ceremonial doors. The courtyard is filled with grief-ridden men and women marching in circles, chanting prayers in Farsi and Arabic. The shrine itself is a small, but exquisite display of mirrors, crystal, and gold ornamentation. However, it is not the beautiful decoration that immediately captures a visitor’s attention. The atmosphere inside is one of open emotion rather than silent reverence. It is filled with the wailing cries and profuse tears of pilgrims who have come to pay respect to Lady Zaynab’s remains. Women tear at their clothes, beat their chests, and collapse to the ground. It is a display of passionate mourning, and the pilgrims mourn her death as they would a beloved daughter. A visit to the Shrine of Lady Zaynab will leave visitors of any faith overwhelmed, both by the beautiful architecture and the moving power of belief."
9,Norias of Hama,"Hama, Syria",Only a handful of these gorgeous historic waterwheels remain but even those are in danger from local unrest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/norias-of-hama,"The Norias of the Syrian city of Hama are a collection of historic waterwheels so lovely and elaborate that they make classical Western waterwheels look weak in comparison. Unfortunately, after surviving for hundreds of years, these lovely wooden constructions are in danger of becoming victims of local conflicts. Evidence of these ornate water wheels dates back as far as the 5th century CE, although none of the extant examples have been found to be quite so ancient. The norias (“wheels of pots” in Arabic) were originally constructed on the Orontes River to move H2O through a series of aqueducts that fed farms all across the settlement, becoming so iconic that they eventually became the symbol of the city. Even after they fell out of general use with the advent of modern irrigation systems, the norias were left intact, aging into beautiful historic icons of the city’s agrarian past. By the modern day there were 17 of the historic wheels still standing across the city, some attached to old buildings, others just standing free as the city changed around them. The iconic relics were even to be considered protected UNESCO artifacts, but unfortunately this designation has yet to be approved. Sadly, it may be too late in any event. Recent reports from the war-torn region suggest that some, if not all of the norias may have been burnt down. For history’s sake let’s hope that these reports are greatly exaggerated. There are 9 different places across the town where the norias are located. By design and appearance they are all the same."

The monastery is currently maintained by a religious order of nuns and overlooks the small town of Sednayah. The religious outpost is about 34 kilometers north of Damascus. Inside the convent is an icon of St. Mary allegedly painted by St Luke."
11,Tomb of Hafez al-Assad,"Al Qardahah, Syria",Three members of Syria's ruling family entombed in quiet mountain town.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tomb-of-hafez-al-asad,"Ever since former Syrian President Hafez al-Assad died in the summer of 2000, it seems his hometown and final resting place of Qardaha has never stopped mourning. The newly paved road leading to his tomb is lined with black lamp posts and lofty trees, and except for the occasional motorcycle or service bus, there is an eerie silence in the vicinity of the tomb. If it weren’t for Assad’s patronage throughout his 30-year tenure, the town of Qardaha would be just another sleepy, mountain town dominated by Syria’s privileged Alawi sect. Today, Qardaha is still tranquil and isolated, but is home to the tombs of the Assad family, including Hafez’s mother Na’asa and his son Basil, who died at the age of 32 in a 1994 car crash. Hafez and Basil are both entombed in a white-roofed mausoleum adorned with Quranic texts that overlooks a lush valley. Their coffins are sunken into the tomb’s marble floor, with black-clad guards pacing and keeping watch. Outside of the tomb, there is an open shed that houses flowers and devotional plaques brought by mourners. Just down the road at Na’asa Assad’s tomb, an aqua green-domed mosque awaits. The inner courtyard fountain is flanked by separate rooms for prayer, but the centerpiece of the tomb is a painted portrait of Hafez bowing with respect to a hagiographic depiction of Na’asa. From Damascus or Aleppo, take any bus to Lattakia. At the Lattakia bus station, there will be many smaller service buses to Qardaha. Once you arrive, follow the black lamp posts."
12,October War Panorama,"Damascus, Syria",3D war panorama in Damascus built with help from North Korea.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/october-war-panorama,"The Tishreen or October War Panaroma Museum in Damascus commemorates the 1973 October War between Israel, Egypt, and Syria from a decidedly Syrian perspective. The external grounds of the museum feature Russian-built tanks and jets used by Syria during the war, as well as captured Israeli weapons with placards highlighting that the weapons are “Made in the U.S.A.” The museum and its exhibits were built in collaboration with North Korea, which is evident from the socialist-realist concrete friezes near the museum’s entrance, as well as the painted portrait of former Syrian President Hafez al-Asad hand-in-hand with former North Korean Leader Kim il-Sung featured in the main gallery. The gallery is full of Asad family portraits, but its true gem is the wall-sized North Korean-painted mural depicting Hafez al-Asad in populist ecstasy as he is thronged by his people. The main event of the museum is the 3D panorama depicting the October War battle for Quneitra in the Golan Heights. While sitting on a rotating platform, visitors are submerged in the battle with pre-recorded Arabic narration from speakers. Located on the Harasta Bus Terminal Road. Take either a taxi or the Harasta microbus. The panorama is noticeable from the road."
13,Cappadocia,"Aksaray, Turkey","In this historic region, homes and churches are carved into ancient volcanic rock formations.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cappadocia,"Located in the Nevşehir Province in the Central Anatolian region of Turkey, Cappadocia is an area where entire cities have been carved into the rock. An area with history so abundant and far-reaching as to render entire centuries as footnotes at first glance, the landscape appears as an abandoned alien desert with fields that look like waves frozen in time, and rocky spikes and spires protruding from the landscape like some sort of meringue set in stone. The rock formations that makeup Cappadocia were created by volcanic eruptions, erosion, and wind. Over three million years ago a volcanic eruption deposited a blanket of ash across the 1,500 square mile landscape which formed into a soft rock. This rock, slowly eaten away by wind and time, has created some spectacular forms. But the human history of the area is as compelling as the geological one. With rock soft enough that you can easily dig right into it, part of what adds to Cappadocia’s strange appearance is that carved into every hillside, spire, and boulder is a home complete with windows, bedrooms, kitchens, and multiple stories connected by ladders or steps. The pathways and structures carved from the rock hold a long history of struggle and resistance. As early as the 3rd century, the caves and tunnels within the rock formations were being used as a hiding place by Christians escaping persecution by the Romans. By the 10th and 11th centuries, Byzantine Christian monks were building hundreds of small churches—each beautifully painted and decorated—into the hillsides as monasteries and training grounds for early Christian missionaries. Nowhere else is the soft pliability of the landscape, and the ingeniousness of the ancient architecture more visible than in the nearby subterranean cities of Derinkuyu and Kaymakli. Derinkuyu is 11 stories deep, has dozens of miles of tunnels connecting it to other underground cities, and can accommodate many thousands of people. It is truly an underground city, with areas for sleeping, stables for livestock, pits for cooking, bathrooms, praying, even for being buried. Today, the tops of the tombs have eroded, exposing the narrow, empty graves. Some 200 underground structures have been discovered in Cappadocia, many of them connecting to each other via tunnels. Most people didn’t live in the underground cities full time. Underneath the cities was a vast network of tunnels, connecting each home in the area to the city. When the area came under attack, families would flee to their basements, rush through the dark tunnels, and gather in the underground city. The boundaries of historical Cappadocia are vague, particularly towards the west. To the west, Cappadocia is bounded by historical regions of Galatia and Lycaonia. To the south, the Taurus Mountains separate Cappadocia from Cilicia and the Mediterranean Sea. Roughly, the area is about 250 miles from east to west and 160 miles from north to south. The name Cappadocia has been co-opted by the tourism industry to refer to any place where natural wonders and geology provide the main forms of entertainment and attraction. Those wishing to enjoy an overnight in the region should visit Gamirasu Cave Hotel and check out the Byzantine King Suite."
14,Basilica Cisterns of Istanbul,"Istanbul, Turkey",A marvel of Byzantine engineering under the streets of Istanbul.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/basilica-cisterns-istanbul,"A Frenchman visiting Constantinople (now Istanbul) in the 1500s heard strange stories of locals drawing up fresh water and even fishing from holes in their cellars. Intrigued by these stories and the legends of great underground temples, he decided to explore. Upon further investigation, he found a subterranean marvel, the largest of the long-forgotten palatial cisterns of the Byzantine Empire. Fish swam in an artificial freshwater lake the size of two football fields and the vaulted brick ceilings were held up by 336 30-foot pillars scavenged from nearby Roman ruins. Amazingly preserved despite centuries of conflict and siege, the cistern was built in 532 by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I to store fresh water for the palace and nearby buildings. Nicknamed Yearbatan Sarayi, or “The Sunken Palace” in Turkish, it is known in English as the “Basilica Cistern” because of its location on the site of an ancient basilica. When Justinian undertook the building of the cistern, Constantinople was still in the shadow of the devastating Nika Revolt which took place in January of that year. The Byzantine equivalent of soccer riots gone massively out of control, the revolt took place in the wake of a hotly contested chariot race and culminated in the burning of much of the imperial city, and the killing of 30,000 rioters by Justinian’s troops. The cisterns were built as part of the rebuilding efforts in the aftermath. In the past, visitors could rent a rowboat to float past the columns in the dripping gloom. Restorations in the late 1980s dredged the silted-in floor and added lighting, elevated walkways, and a cafe for visitors. There are still fish in the now-shallow water, helping to keep the water clear. The two giant Gorgon-head pillar bases at the far end of the cistern are an intriguing mystery. It is suspected that they may have been pulled out of an older pagan temple, where motifs of the famous Gorgon Medusa were used as a protective emblem. It is possible that the placement of these two faces—upside down and sideways, at the base of pillars—may have been a deliberate display of the power of the new Christian Empire. Or it’s possible that the stones were just the right size. The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places.

15,Pamukkale Water Terraces,"Denizli, Turkey",Roman ruins top white travertine terraces formed by ancient hot springs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pamukkale-water-terraces,"Once a kind of Roman-era health spa, the spectacular rock formations below the ancient city of Hierapolis form a blindingly white natural cascading fountain. Waters from ancient hot springs spilling down the hillside for a millennia have formed terraces of oyster-shell shaped pools, the white travertine constantly refreshed by the flow of the calcium rich waters. Named the “Cotton Castle” in Turkish, the site has been celebrated as a natural wonder since the second century BC when the city of Hierapolis was formed around the healing waters. A thriving metropolis during the Roman era, the city survived and rebuilt several times following earthquakes, and it was not completely abandoned until 1300 AD. The ruins are extensive, including a Nymphaeum fountain which distributed water throughout the city, a large amphitheater, as well as the remains of the largest ancient necropolis in Turkey. Together with the ruins of Hierapolis, Pamukkale is now a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site. Before the designation, the terraces were in danger of being destroyed through a combination of neglect and commercial development. Hotels were built at the top of the site, partly obscuring ruins of Hierapolis , and wear and tear from the feet and shoes of visitors had scarred and turned many of the pools brown. Efforts to protect the delicate natural phenomenon have dramatically changed the area. Hotels have been demolished, and in an effort to allow the pools natural white appearance to be maintained, access to the pools is tightly restricted, and water released from the spring is controlled and only distributed to a few pools at a time. Artificial pools for bathing tourists have been added. Although natural phenomenon like this is exceedingly rare, a similar but smaller set of travertine pools exist in Huanglong, China. Sadly, another site beloved by Victorian settlers in New Zealand was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1886. Visitors should bring a backpack to comfortably carry their shoes, as you can explore the main drift of the mountain, but only barefoot.  The nearest town is Denizli, approximately 20km away. Local buses (""dolmush"") and taxi's are available in Denizli to Pamukkale."
16,Lycian Rock Tombs,"Fethiye, Turkey",These tombs were built into the side of a mountain so that ancient angels could reach the dead.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lycian-rock-tombs,"Carved into the side of a Turkish mountain are what look to be the entrances to countless temples, but are in fact the ornate facade of ancient Lycian tombs. The Lycians believed that their dead were carried to the afterlife by magic winged creatures and thus they placed their honored dead in geographically high places such as the cliffside. Dating back to the 4th century, many of the numerous entryways are adorned with tall Classical columns and intricate reliefs, a bit duller from centuries of weathering. The older tombs are often no more than unremarked holes dug into the rock. Despite the external grandeur, the interior of the tombs are spare chambers cut into the rock with a simple monolith inside to display the body and the rooms, are otherwise empty from hundreds of years worth of looting."
17,Myra Necropolis,"Demre, Turkey","A Lycian city of the dead carved into the hillside of Southern Turkey, complete with startlingly human touches.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/myra-necropolis,"Though archaeologists rank the exquisite necropolises at Myra as classics of Lycian culture, the site’s most beautiful elements are some of its touching, humanizing details. Dating back to the 4th century BCE, the rock-cut tombs line the hills above Myra’s famed theater and the Church of St. Nicholas. These houses of the dead are divided into two main necropolises comprised of a mixture of house- and temple-style tombs: the ocean necropolis and the river necropolis. Colorful as they seem now, most have faded greatly over the years after having been painted brilliant shades of red, yellow, blue, and purple in their prime. The most famous example of this was documented by early explorer Charles Fellows during his visit in 1840. Named after the lion and bull adorning its facade, the “Lion Tomb” also contains 11 life-sized stone figures thought to represent the grave owner’s family. A number of inscriptions in ancient Greek and Lycian appear carved throughout, including one that sounds as if it could’ve been written just yesterday: Moschos loves Philiste, the daughter of Demetrios. Once exclusively the provenance of the upper and middle classes, the presence of Myra’s remarkable necropolises signal the residents’ former prosperity in addition to an ongoing sense of security that translated from this world into the next."
18,Gobekli Tepe,"Örencik, Turkey",This hunter-gatherer architecture is believed to be the oldest religious complex known.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gobekli-tepe,"Summarizing the importance of the the archaeological site at Gobekli Tepe (Turkish for “Hill with a Belly”) is a formidable task. In 1994, German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt and his team unearthed a handful of findings that continue to revolutionize the way archeologists think about Stone Age man. The site dates back 11,500 years, to the tail end of the Stone Age. The predominant understanding was that during this time, hunter-gatherers roamed the Earth, never settling, living as each day came. The huge Gobekli Tepe complex, however, brings this view into question. It consists of large, T-shaped pillars with animal carvings, huge stone rings, and a vast amount of rectangular rooms, many believed to have religious importance. One theory is that this site was not used for domestic purposes, but for rituals and sacrifices and the site at Gobekli Tepe is believed by some to be the oldest religious complex known to modern man. For this reason, the site has often invited breathless comparisons to the Garden of Eden, or the “origin of religion,” which has long been associated with the Fertile Crescent and the ancient Sumerians, who invented written language. Equally curious is the fact that before this discovery, there was no evidence of hunter-gatherers ever erecting large monuments and buildings, making this perhaps the world’s oldest known architecture. Nearby the site is Mount Karaca Dag, a mountain that geneticists believe to be the birth place of many of today’s cultivated grains. It’s theorized that Gobleki Tepe could be showing us a transition period, depicting nomadic cultures’ first attempt to farm (which would later bring about permanent settlement). The one acre excavation site has raised more questions than it has answered, and astoundingly enough, the site is believed to extend some 22 additional acres. Around 8,000 B.C., the site was filled with soil and mysteriously abandoned."
19,Troy,"Çanakkale, Turkey",This famous city eluded concrete detection until the early 2000's.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/troy,"Famous for being the focal point of the legendary Trojan war, the city that was duped by a wooden horse was long theorized to exist around the region of modern Turkey, but it took decades of literary comparison to actually find the city of Troy. In 1868 German businessman and archeologist Heinrich Schliemann had a chance meeting with English archeologist Frank Calvert who had begun digging in Hisarlik, Turkey and the first step in finding Troy was underway. The two were able to uncover a number of overlapping classical ruins in the area pointing to a series of cities that were essentially built on top of one another over the early centuries. Excavations on the area continued unabated throughout the years after its groundbreaking, with each new team finding more and more artifacts and ruins in a seemingly endless series of discoveries. The Troy site would come to be one of the most complex archeological digs in history, revealing nine distinct ages of urban construction. Over the years researchers dug up coins, jewelry, defensive walls, theaters, and a number of other buildings. While all of the work at the Troy site was done under the general acceptance that the site was the actual location of the historical city, it was not confirmed (as much as such a thing can be) until 2001 when a team of researchers used a mix of geology, literary reference, and topography to identify the site. Troy now welcomes tourists, and you don’t even need to trick your way past the gates."
20,Ottoman Bird Palaces,"Istanbul, Turkey",The ornate miniature mansions were built for Istanbul's feathered residents.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ottoman-bird-palaces,"Look up while roaming the streets of Istanbul, and you may see little palaces carved into the sides of its mosques and schools. The city’s birds have been calling these ornamented miniature mansions home for centuries. People had been building birdhouses before the dawn of the Ottoman Empire, but they weren’t as ornate. The ones the Ottomans built were not simple structures, but were instead complex multi-level houses with copious ornaments and details. With their intricate windows, balconies, roofs, and towers, they mimicked the sort of grand abode you’d expect to find a regal human living in. Creating the little bird palaces went beyond pure aesthetic appeal. It was said that building the houses and showing such kindness for the city’s feathered residents was a way to curry favor with God. The structures also kept birds from nesting inside buildings. Only a handful of such bird palaces remain, but you should find some in nearly every city in Turkey. Many of them have survived in Istanbul. They’re aged and weathered with time, but a number of them still boast the fantastic details that make them so intriguing. The oldest one is on the side of Büyükçekmece Bridge, close to the city.  In Istanbul there are many locations where you can find bird palaces. Just to name a few: Sayyed Hassan Pasha Madrasa, Laleli Mosque, Millet Kutuphanesi, Yeni Valide Mosque, Ayazma Mosque, and Taksim Mescidi."
21,Pluto's Gate,"Denizli Merkez, Turkey",A deadly ancient portal to the underworld.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/plutos-gate,"The deadly vapors that still waft out of this “gate to hell” were once used in ancient rituals to the gods of the underworld, and still claim the lives of unfortunate birds who get too close. Known as Pluto’s Gate, or Ploutonion in Greek, the archeological site in southwestern Turkey was discovered in 2013 after following the route of a thermal spring. The site matches closely the description of the temple to the underworld that disappeared in the 6th century. Tourists to the portal to the underworld were able to buy small birds or other animals (the sale of which supported the temple) and test out the toxic air that blew out of the mysterious cavern, which was connected to a temple with a pool. Only the priests, high and hallucinating on the fumes, could stand on the steps by the opening to hell, and would sometimes lead sacrificial bulls inside, only to pull out their dead bodies dramatically. As the Greek geographer, philosopher, and prolific traveler Strabo, who lived from 64/63 BC to 24 AD), so enticingly described it: “This space is full of a vapor so misty and dense that one can scarcely see the ground. Any animal that passes inside meets instant death. I threw in sparrows and they immediately breathed their last and fell.”"
22,Kekova Island Sunken Ruins,"Kaleüçağız Köyü, Turkey",Hidden just under the waters around this Turkish island are the ruins of a once great city.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kekova-island-sunken-ruins,"Before the Ottomans, the Byzantines, or the Romans, this remote corner of Turkey was home to the world’s first democratic federation, the remains of which are now sitting beneath the waves. The Lycians were a peaceful federation of city-states, dating from around 2000 BCE, and included the sea-trading city of Simena. In the 2nd century CE, Simena was hit by a series of violent earthquakes and sank beneath the waves. Today it is still possible to see the city ruins, clearly visible just a few meters below the clear waters of the Mediterranean. The ruins of Simena include a shipyard, foundations of public buildings,houses, and a couple of amphorae. Above the shoreline, further houses, a few Lycian tombs with their distinctive arched roofs, and the remains of an early church are visible. A stone staircase can also still be found descending into the calm waters. Kekova Island, where the ruins are located, is now uninhabited, although a few goats can be spotted grazing among the ruins. Occasionally a villager rows across to harvest the wild thyme (“kekik”) that gives the island its name. In 1990 the Turkish government declared Kekova Island and the surrounding region to be a Specially Protected Area, preserving it from further development. UNESCO also lists it as a “tentative” candidate for World Heritage status. Swimming, snorkeling, diving, and jet-skis are forbidden in the area around the sunken city; however, chartered boats are permitted to cruise above it at a slow pace, affording a good view of the ruins both above and below the waterline. Two-hour trips around the bay are available on rather crowded tour boats from nearby Ucagiz. If you're staying at Kaş or Kalkan it's more comfortable to join a scheduled full-day cruise on a gulet from Kaş. Gulets can also be privately chartered for a few days or a week exploring the Lycian coast. Another option is to book a kayak trip from Kaş: you start with a bus ride to the seaside village where the kayaks are, from where you paddle across the strait to Kekova, then back to the mainland for lunch in another village. There's a support boat, so if you get tired or the wind and waves pick up, you can get a ride back to the bus if you need it."
23,Ani Ghost City,"Ocaklı Köyü, Turkey","An abused and forgotten metropolis, abandoned for centuries.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ani-ghost-city,"“The army entered the city, massacred its inhabitants, pillaged and burned it, leaving it in ruins and taking prisoner all those who remained alive…The dead bodies were so many that they blocked the streets; one could not go anywhere without stepping over them.” -Arab historian Sibt ibn al-Jawzi, c. 1064 Sacked, abandoned and forgotten, the magnificent medieval city of Ani was once home to as many as 200,000 people, but has stood empty and in ruins for centuries. Called by some the “City of 1001 Churches,” and by others the “City of Forty Gates,” Ani is situated in disputed territory within the Turkish province of Kars, near the border with Armenia. The city was originally Armenian, but the territory on which it stands is still argued over between modern day Turkey and Armenia. Once a contemporary rival of Constantinople, Baghdad and Cairo, Ani fell to a succession of invaders . Both contributing to the ruin’s slow demise and as a result of its deterioration, earthquakes, war, and vandalism have all take their toll. However, sentiment is emerging that the city needs to be protected no matter whose jurisdiction it falls under. The city’s many remaining churches are extraordinarily beautiful, even in their ruined state. The minaret Menüçehr Mosque, newer than many of the churches but still nearly a thousand years old, still stands as a testament to the city’s long history and diverse cultural influences. International heritage organizations have long been concerned with Ani’s fate. In 1996, 1998 and 2000 ,Ani was included in the World Monument Fund’s Watch Lists of 100 Most Endangered Sites. Official permission was needed to visit or photograph the site until 2004, but as notions of conservation and historical intrigue have sparked more of an interest in the area, regulations like these are no longer needed and it has become much easier to visit Ani today. Despite recent improvements, in 2010 Ani was identified by the Global Monument Fund as part of their report on endangered world heritage sites. In 2011 the World Monument Fund announced the beginning of official restoration work in partnership with the Turkish Ministry of Culture."
24,Tombili,"Istanbul, Turkey","A meow-velous tribute to a beloved street cat, made famous on the internet.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tombili,"In a city crawling with cats, it takes a fabulous feline to truly stand out. Enter Tombili, a chubby white-bellied tabby cat with a peculiar penchant for slouching against steps rather than sitting atop them. Her friendly nature made her a beloved resident of Istanbul’s Ziverbey neighborhood. She was, as locals were quick to realize, a cool cat. Tombili’s fame spread beyond her usual haunts after an image of her lounging in her preferred pose went viral online and became a meme. In the picture, she leans against a step, one paw draped over her tubby white tummy while the other rests atop the concrete. She’s poised as if about to ask a question, perhaps a casual inquiry about how long you’ve been coming to the neighborhood, before launching into her own life story. If you’re a cat person with access to the internet, you’ve likely come across the image. The “Chill Cat” meme puts Tombili in a myriad of scenarios: settled on a lavish couch, beckoning someone to “paint her like one of their French girls;” dressed up like Julius Caesar, complete with a Roman toga; or lazed across her chosen perch with a drink. Sadly, the beloved cat died in August of 2016. The district mayor commemorated the famous feline by installing a sculpture of Tombili in her iconic pose atop a step on World Animal Day. The sculpture was stolen a month after its installation, but after much public outcry, the thieves returned it to its original spot. People still visit to pay their respects to the internet star."
25,Viking Runes at Hagia Sophia,"Istanbul, Turkey",A small etching on the white marble parapet was written in runic script by a Viking mercenary.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/viking-runes-at-hagia-sophia,"On a balmy Thracian Sunday some 1,100 years ago, during a liturgy given in the massive basilica of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, possibly during the solemn, laborious prayer of the Anaphora, a bored soldier carved his name into the white marble parapet that surrounds the balcony of the church’s upper gallery. The letters he carved, however, weren’t Greek; this wasn’t a native warrior, but a Viking mercenary from the Scandinavian lands of the north. His runic inscription is still visible today. They read, approximately, “Halfdan carved these runes,” or “Halfdan was here,” a familiar sentiment shared by crude etchings across the millennia. A transparent plastic slab protects the inscription, which can be found in the gallery on the second floor of the basilica. The Vikings who came to Constantinople to seek glory and occasionally great wealth were known as the Varangian Guard, after the Greek word for Viking or Norseman. The tradition of their service dates to the 9th century, when the Kievan Rus and the Byzantine Empire settled a peace treaty that allowed for some Rus warriors to join the empire’s army. Later Varangians included Harald Hardrada, who fought with the Byzantines against the muslims in Sicily before becoming King of Norway, as well as many 11th-century Anglo-Saxons ironically exiled from Britain by another group of Norsemen, the Normans. The Varangians were prized not just for their massive size and handiness with an axe, but for their loyalty, as they had been steeped in an oath-driven warrior culture that prized fealty to one’s lord. Also, having no local connections, the Viking mercenaries couldn’t be suspected of conspiracy with the Emperor’s enemies, who more often than not were located within the treacherous court of Constantinople rather than outside its walls."
26,Tombs of the Sultans,"Istanbul, Turkey","Five sultans and their families rest in eternal splendor, teeming with overlooked beauty and drama.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tombs-of-the-sultans,"Thanks to the Ottomans’ incredible sense of aesthetic, the tombs of Mehmed III, Selim II, Murad III, İbrahim I and Mustafa I more closely resemble stunning palaces in tribute to the memory of sultans past than what likely leaps to mind when conjuring images of eternal resting places for ancient, deceased royals. The complex itself is arranged in a linear formation along the periphery of the Hagia Sophia. Often overlooked and quite literally overshadowed by what is possibly Istanbul’s most iconic sight, the tombs date from as early as 1574 and make extraordinary use of tilework, calligraphy, and paintwork. No two are alike, despite sharing common motifs arranged according to the preference of their designers, several of which were designed by the famous architect Mimar Sinan. With doors flung open to the public, the sultans and their families retain their dignity and privacy by way of shrouds of an impenetrable emerald green color draped over their sarcophagi. Sloping at crisp angles, standing bold against a field of fine ornate tiles, these eternal family portraits are uniquely striking. The closer one looks at the details, the more fascinating the sultans’ tombs become. Particularly true of this is the tomb of Sultan Selim II. On the architectural front, the fine blue tiles on the door’s left side appear lighter in color due for the originals were removed in 1895; sent to France for restoration, they somehow ended up in the Louvre, where they remain to this day. The pale blue tiles on the tomb’s door are replacements that don’t quite match the originals on the opposing door. Similarly, though the sarcophagi themselves are intentionally anonymous under deceptively uniform shrouds, a look into the backstory of each family reveals the humanity and drama hidden beneath. Selim II’s tomb is noticeably packed with family members, many of whom seem oddly small at the time of their deaths. Though not posted anywhere inside, history reveals that during the course of one single night in 1574, five of his younger sons were murdered to ensure Murad III’s succession. But it doesn’t stop there… 19 of Murad’s own sons also can be found resting alongside him, murdered to ensure his eldest’s succession, after which point the grisly practice of fratricide was put to an end. Imagine: this describes just one of the five tombs resting in the shadow of Hagia Sophia. The rest of the details – beautiful and chilling – await your deep dive into the individual lives of the sultans, their wives, each architect, and their designers. They’ll be there waiting, ever so patiently.  Located at the southeast corner of Hagia Sophia"
27,Abandoned Village of Kayakoy,"Kayaköy, Turkey",A Turkish ghost town abandoned in a population exchange with Greece.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kayakoy-turkey,"The deserted ruins of this once-bustling town are nestled against the Taurus Mountains, close to the world-famous beaches and yacht-filled harbor at Olu Deniz. Although the stone buildings are roofless and weathered and the narrow streets worn with age, this is not an ancient city, but a modern ruin deserted for political reasons in the 1920s. In Lycian times, the town was known as Karmilassos. When the Greeks occupied it, they changed its name to Levissi. The first mention of Levissi dates back to the 14th century and it belongs to Sanudo, an Italian traveler. Originally built in the 1700s, the town called Karmylassos in Greek was home to as many as 20,000 Greek Orthodox residents by the early twentieth century. The messy fallout of World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire led to the land grabs of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). The resounding loss of the Greeks in this war ended with violence and retribution, which was often aimed at the remaining Greek Orthodox community within the new Turkish borders, and in turn, against the Muslim Turks in Greece. Hundreds of thousands of Greeks fled the violence in Turkey, which led the governments to agree to a mutual compulsory population exchange starting in 1923 in order to staunch the bloodshed. The residents of Kayakoy, who had thus far lived peacefully with their Turkish neighbors, abandoned the town and went to Greece, which was struggling to find places for the nearly 200,000 refugees of the exchange, added to the more than a million former Turkish residents who had fled before the official exchange. Over 300,000 Turks were forcibly removed from Greece to a war-ravaged, but land-rich, Turkey in exchange. The polar explorer and Nobel Prize-winning Norwegian scientist Fridtjof Nansen was assigned the task of organizing the exchange. In Kayakoy, approximately 350 homes now sit empty and mostly roofless, along with two Greek Orthodox churches and the fountains and cisterns that watered the city. Harsh winters and strong winds have stripped the buildings down to ruins, making the town look ancient. A private museum tells the story of the town. The book Birds Without Wings by Louis de Bernieres is set in a fictionalized version of Karakoy during WWI and the last days of the Ottoman Empire. Kayaköy was adopted by the UNESCO as a World Friendship and Peace Village. The closest airport is Dalaman. The village is a short drive from Oludeniz, or a 2 1/2 hour walk along a marked mountain path."
28,Termessos,"Bayatbademleri Köyü, Turkey","Once described as the ""Eagle's Nest,"" this ruined ancient city rests on a remote mountaintop.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/termessos,"The one city Alexander the Great didn’t bother stopping to conquer, Termessos sits at the top of a mountain near the southern Turkish coast. Old-growth forest now embrace the tumbled stone ruins of Termessos. Said to have been founded by the mythological hero Bellerophon, during its heyday, the city was known for its impenetrable defense thanks to its mountaintop location, rising over a thousand meters into the sky. In reality it was founded by a community known as the Solims. Little is known of the people or the culture of Termessos despite it being incredibly well preserved, with most of the information gleaned from stories and histories. The towns remoteness served it well, providing it with some autonomy from Rome and sparing it from being sacked by Alexander the Great who referred to it as “the Eagle’s Nest.” However its remote mountaintop location would also be its downfall. Although little is known, it is believed that the town was abandoned sometime around 200 C.E. an earthquake destroyed the towns aqueduct, cutting off its supply of water. The Solims seemed to have simply walked away leaving a remarkably preserved town behind. A large number of stone structures and exposed tombs remain on the site, although some of them have been plundered. Because the site is not under strict archeological control many reliefs and inscriptions have been relocated to the nearby Museum of Antalya. Although it’s a short drive from Antalya, getting there involves a steep hike up the mountain from the top of the road, so it lacks the usual tourist crowds of the southern Turkish coast.  Visitors can watch clouds pass by through the empty windows behind the stunning ancient amphitheater, and admire the ancient tombs lining the path up the mountain. The combination of woodland, ruin, and spectacular mountain vistas makes it well worth the effort despite what Alexander the Great thought."
29,Buried Village of Al Madam,"Al Madam, United Arab Emirates",An abandoned desert hamlet swallowed up by sand.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buried-village-of-al-madam,"On a strip of desert behind the town of Al Madam lies a tiny ghost village lost in sand. It consists of two rows of colorful houses and a mosque at one end, all long-deserted and engulfed by the dunes. There is something poetic in the way nature has taken over these old abandoned buildings, and something eerie as well. The small houses have rusty iron gates, and inside are colorful blue and green rooms decorated with ceramic tiles and wallpapers. Each room is filled with piles of sand, sometimes stretching halfway up the walls, pocked with scorpion footprints all over. Local legend holds that it was the jinns—supernatural creatures that Arabs and Muslims believe exist in a plane invisible to humans—who drove the people away from their village. The settlement was likely first built in the 1970s or ’80s and inhabited by the local Al Kutbi tribe. It was abandoned not long afterward. Though this strange and silent place does indeed feel haunted, in reality, it was almost certainly the encroaching desert that drove residents from their homes. Today the little lost hamlet is referred to by locals either as the “old village,” “ghost village,” or “buried village” of Al Madam. Some buildings are now entirely inside the dunes and have windows on the roof, so explorers should take care where they step.  The buried village can be found from Google Maps by the name ""The old area of Madame."" It's about 37 miles from Dubai. There is no public transportation to take you there, so a taxi is a good option. It's about 300 dirhams there and back from Dubai. It's good to tell the driver that the road near the village is sandy desert road. You can use the small sand road that is marked on Google Maps, and turns from Umm al quwain AI Shuwaid RD. There are also some abandoned shops and building sites near the village. The dunes around the village are also very beautiful."
30,Dubai Miracle Garden,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Billed as the ""largest natural flower garden in the world"" this Middle Eastern show field has little competition at 45 million flowers.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dubai-miracle-garden,"With classic Dubai opulence, the Middle Eastern city has established what is possibly the largest flower garden in the world at the Dubai Miracle Garden. As yet another grandiose project proving that Dubai can support any endeavor the rest of the world can and bigger, the recently opened Miracle Garden may be the city’s most ambitious undertaking yet. Planted on over 775,000 square feet of land, the garden creates massive designs and shapes using fields and flowerbeds using a seemingly impossible 45 million separate flowers. The miraculous growing project is especially impressive in that it exists in Dubai’s harsh desert climate. The caretakers of the garden claim that the growth is possible through the careful re-use of wastewater and irrigation that uses the drip method as opposed to a more wasteful spray method. No matter how it is achieved, the staggeringly colorful fields of blooms, shaped like hearts and igloos, and built up trellises constructed to look like famous building, seem like something out of a fairy tale. This effect is undoubtedly intentional, perfectly accenting the other fantastically over-the-top projects that have come to define the city. The Dubai Miracle Garden is not yet finished either. There are plans to build a shopping center and full nursery as well."
31,The World Islands,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",This artificial archipelago was supposed to resemble a map of the world.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-islands,"Dubai is famous for its luxurious Palm Islands, the easily recognizable manmade archipelago off of the city’s coast. Based on the Palm’s success, Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Maktoum, envisioned an even bolder archipelago project in 2003: a group of islands shaped like a map of the world. Unlike the Palm Islands, however, it seems the World Islands may have been a disaster of global proportions. Construction of the World Islands began in September of 2003. Requiring 321 million cubic meters of sand—about the volume of 150 Major League Baseball stadiums, up to the top of the foul poles and including the stands—the World Islands cost over $14 billion to build. With one island for every country (excluding Israel), the World Islands together covered over 20 square miles of the Persian Gulf. Located just three miles off the coast of Dubai, the 300 islands that made up the World Islands are supposed to resemble a world map when viewed from above. Unfortunately for the islands’ developers, the archipelago turned out to be only vaguely recognizable. Due to weathering, sinking, and erosion, the World Islands have lost their well-defined borders. Central America is practically nonexistent, Australia is awkwardly made up of five rectangular strips of sand, and Europe, Africa, and Asia have merged into a largely indistinguishable blob. In addition to the aesthetic problem, the World Islands don’t have a reliable source of electricity, as the plan to install electric cables under the Persian Gulf has fallen flat. For these reasons, 291 of the 300 World Islands have been left undeveloped and to this day remain nothing but sand. Even though 60% of the islands were sold to private companies and investors by 2008, after eight years nearly all have remained untouched. As of 2016, only nine of the islands have been developed: Lebanon Island, Pete’s Island, the six islands making up the “Heart of Europe” resort, and Island Michael Schumacher (named after the seven-time Formula One World Champion). The entire continents of Africa, Asia, Australia, and South America remain entirely uninhabited blotches of sand."
32,Elephant Clock,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",A faithful reproduction of Al-Jazari's enormous water clock.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephant-clock,"Built over five months to exacting diagrams in an original 13th century manuscript, the elaborate elephant-shaped water clock at the Ibn Battuta mall in Dubai is a tribute to 800 year old engineering brilliance. The Elephant clock was only one of many ingenious devices designed by the polymath inventor Al-Jazari (full name: Badi Al-Zaman Abu Al-Izz Ismail Bin Al-Razzaz Al-Jazari), who worked as chief engineer for the Artuklu Palace, now in Turkey, in the middle-ages. In his famous manuscript, known in English as the Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices, published in 1206, Al-Jazari described in detail 50 machines of varying complexity, illustrated with beautiful color miniatures. His work and book are different from a lot or early treatises on mechanical contraptions in that he was a gifted mechanic, and the book is more of a practical guide than merely a theoretical book of engineering concepts. His instructions included devices like automatic gates and doors, animal and humanoid automata, and clocks. It was the clocks for which he would become most famous. These were more than just mechanical toys. The complexity of his 11 foot Castle astronomical clock is so complex, it is considered to be an example of an early programmable analog computer. Timekeeping had special role in the Muslim faith, allowing followers to more accurately know the five times for prayer in the absence of a call to prayer. In Al-Jazari’s time, the Islamic empire had reached new heights, covering most of North Africa, Europe, and Asia. The technology of simple water clocks dates back to Babylonia, Ancient Egypt, and Greece, and less complicated examples of water clocks were used throughout the Muslim world to help keep time. The Elephant clock is different from these, both in its elaborate form and function. The physical details of his clock represent different cultures: The elephant is an Asian elephant which represents India, the dragon-like serpent represents China, the phoenix at the top represents ancient Egypt, and the turbaned figure represents Muslim cultures. The internal mechanisms of the clock, driven by floats in water tanks hidden in the belly of the elephant, activate the various components into mechanical motion every half hour. The 3.5 million square foot mall, in which the elephant clock can be found is named for the 14th century explorer Ibn Battuta. The mall is divided into themed sections, each taking visual inspiration from various lands visited by Battuta. The Elephant clock is located in the India Court portion. The full-size working reproduction was commissioned for the 2005 opening of the mall, and carried out by the U.K.-based Foundation for Science, Technology and Civilization (FSTC), who consulted on the design of the decor. The FSTC is dedicated to disseminating information about Muslim history and culture. According to mall publications, there are plans to re-create his famous Castle Clock as well. There are at least three other examples of reconstructions of the Elephant Clock, including one outside the Musee d’Horlogerie du Locle, Chateau des Monts, in Le Locle, Switzerland, and one at the Institute for the History of Arab-Islamic Science in Frankfurt, Germany. The newest, 20 foot tall, Elephant clock is on display at the London  Science Museum through April 2010 as part of the exhibit 1001 Inventions, dedicated to the history of Muslim science and technology.

33,Masdar City,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","Planned as the world’s first zero-carbon city, it had lofty ideals—but is only 5 percent completed and aiming for 50 percent carbon-neutral.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/masdar-city,"In recognition of climate change being one of the most dangerous threats to humanity on Planet Earth, a company in the United Arab Emirates called “Masdar” (nicknamed the “Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company”) planned in 2006 to construct a 100% green city. That’s right—a fully functional city that emits not one ounce of greenhouse gas. They began with a down payment of $22 billion dollars, and with it they built a central plaza of modern terracotta buildings, complete with an Arab texture, to house up to 1500 green energy businesses. The city was built for 50,000 workers living within the city limits, plus an additional 60,000 from the surrounding areas, with the majority of them working towards a clean energy future. With this planned excess of clean energy, the operators of Masdar City devised contraptions that would take hot desert air from the sky and convert it to cool ground air, making Masdar City up to 20ºC cooler than the adjacent Abu Dhabi. This clean energy was also going to be used to power a 100%-green transportation grid. This transit system is made up of electrically-powered Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) vehicles, which are pods that circulate the city’s underground and are free for all residents to use. They were to offer nonstop transit for three to six people from Point A to Point B. Besides the PRT system, the city also caters to pedestrians and cyclists, and the only cars allowed in are electric ones. To further reduce waste, movement sensors have been integrated into the city to replace water taps and light switches, which reduces water and energy consumption by over 50% each. Just like that, Masdar City became the first carbon neutral city to ever be built in the entire world. Except for one thing: it was never finished. The original plan was to have the city fully completed by 2016. But due to the global financial crisis of the late 2000s, the project has stalled, and current estimates have it being completed by 2030—a deadline extension of nearly 250%. As of today, only 5% of the original “greenprint” has been fully constructed. Today’s Masdar City is like a green ghost city. Except, not even that green. After the mission was declared a failure, the planning directors decided to abandon the zero carbon idea, and are currently building the rest of the city to be 50% carbon-neutral."

Since snow is kind of hard to come by in Dubai, they went ahead and just built a snowy mountain inside of their giant mall. Contained entirely indoors, the one-stop winter resort pulls out all the stops to help people pretend they aren’t in a desert where temperatures can climb to above 120 degrees. The main attraction is the 279-foot “mountain” that looks strangely impressive even from the outside. The artificial geological feature has multiple ski runs including the world’s first indoor black diamond rated course. If skiing or snowboarding isn’t your thing, there are also all sorts of other attractions like toboggans and even a place for you to meet penguins. The temperature in the facility is maintained at a crisp 30 degrees during operation thanks to a sophisticated insulation system that counteracts the sun’s best efforts. The temperature is dropped in the evening so that they can make fresh new snow for their unnatural resort. As with many things in Dubai, just because it seems like it shouldn’t be, doesn’t mean won’t be, and Ski Dubai is no exception. The concept of a ski resort in that part of the world is foreign enough that each entrance fee includes rental of coats and snow gear, because there is no reasonable reason to have such things otherwise.  Mall of the Emirates is located on Sheikh Zayed Road. By car, take Exit 39 on the 4th interchange and follow the indications towards Al Barsha zone. By metro, take the Red Line to the Mall of the Emirates Metro Station."
35,Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Whitewashed mosque contains the world's largest carpet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sheikh-zayed-mosque,"Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan is often called the father of the United Arab Emirates. As the first president of the country, he worked to push the UAE into the modern world, and was caught in a crossfire between modernity and tradition throughout his reign. As a lasting monument to his struggle, he began building the Grand Mosque in 1996. Sheikh Zayed died in 2004 and was buried on the grounds of the mosque. Three years later, the impressive building that had cost $545 million to create, finally opened its doors to the public. With a capacity for 40,000 worshippers, it is one of the largest mosques in the world. However, its size alone is not its most amazing characteristic. Inside the prayer hall is the world’s largest carpet, weighing in at 35 tons and covering 60,000 square feet. With over 2.3 billion knots, the carpet represents the grand effort of the mosque. The prayer room also features a number of massive chandeliers bedecked in Swarovski crystals. Attracting more than just worshippers, the mosque has continued the fight of Sheikh Zayed between the modern world and traditions."
36,Burj Al Arab,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","A preposterously luxurious hotel with gold-plated iPads, Rolls Royce chauffeurs, and a staff that trains by watching ""Downton Abbey.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/burj-al-arab,"Located on a manmade island off the coast of Dubai, the Burj Al Arab is the third tallest hotel in the world, and, according to some, the most luxurious place to stay on the planet—dubbed “the world’s only seven star hotel.” Built for $1 billion and standing at 56 floors tall, the shape of the Burj Al Arab is modeled after the sail of a J-Class yacht, and its features are no less extravagant; a room will run you between $2,700 and $24,000 per night. The luxurious Burj Al Arab experience begins even before entering the hotel. Hotel guests are greeted at Dubai International Airport by their choice of a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce or a lift from a helicopter. Those who choose the latter will land on a helipad suspended at the very top of the hotel, a platform that was converted to a tennis court in 2005 to host an epic match between Andre Agassi and Roger Federer. Once guests enter the hotel, the over-the-top extravagance becomes even more amplified. One of sixteen elevators will bring guests to the lobby, built with 258,000 square feet of Statuario marble. To add on to the marble, an additional 22,000 square feet of the Burj Al Arab’s interior is covered in 24-carat gold. In the Talise Spa’s “Romantic Moonlight Swim” you can swim in four indoor and outdoor pools while enjoying champagne, strawberries, and a view of the Persian Gulf. There are nine restaurants at Burj Al Arab, including Al Mahara (“Oyster”), where you can dine beside a 260,000-gallon aquarium. After a nice meal, you may want to lie down in your room, which come replete with revolving beds, gold-plated iPads in every room, a selection of 17 different types of pillows, mosaic tiling, a marble jacuzzi, and a private butler on each floor. The hotel staff is so committed to luxury that part of their training includes watching episodes of Downton Abbey."
37,Dubai Gold Souk,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","On any given day this sprawling market houses literally tons of government-regulated gold, gems, and precious metals.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dubai-gold-souk,"Golden fixtures, doorknobs, phones, or any other everyday object made of the precious metal is nothing new in the United Arab Emirates. So it should come as no surprise that one of the biggest gold markets in the world is in Dubai, the country’s largest city. Known as a souk, this sprawling bazaar of gold traders, diamond merchants, and jewelers loops through a series of galleries, covered at the top but still retaining the flavor of an open-air market. What is offered is scrupulously regulated by the UAE government, ensuring authenticity—something mostly lacking from the street vendors outside. What is not regulated is the price, which makes haggling an integral part of the experience. If it’s true that this is the market where skilled hagglers can find the best deals in the world—not only on gold, but on platinum, silver, and gems as well—there are over 300 outlets to test the hypothesis. At its inception in the early 1900s there were only a handful of local jewelers. It grew considerably in the 1940s when new trade policies encouraged Iranian and Indian entrepreneurs to set up shop, but it was the oil boom of the 1970s that made the Dubai Gold Souk the icon it is today. The market has undergone a process of expansion and gentrification through the years, but it has managed to retain the charm and atmosphere of an Arabian souk. It’s said that no less than 10 tons of gold are spread across the vendors on any given day—a claim that’s tough to prove, but hard to dispute.  The Gold Souk is in the Deira section of Dubai, and it is open seven days a week from 10am to 10pm except Friday, when it doesn't open until 4pm. Note that some vendors close between the hours of 1pm and 4pm.The souk is a collection of open-sided galleries and booths, so keep that in mind is you visit during the hottest months: no air conditioning.The closest metro station is Al Ras."
38,Singing Sand Dunes of Liwa,"Mezairaa, United Arab Emirates","Over the dunes of the Empty Quarter, the mysterious music of the desert.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/singing-sand-dunes-liwa,"According to local legend, evil spirits whisper names to disorient travelers and drag them into danger, singing through the moaning tons of the sand dunes. From beneath footsteps and car wheels, a deep roaring tone comes from the sand. The sound has been compared to the low note of the didgeridoo or a low-flying plane. In the 1200s, Marco Polo, in his journeys through the dunes of China, said he was struck by “the sounds of all kinds of musical instruments,” and also “of drums and the clash of arms.” The phenomenon is caused by the vibrations of the grains of sand as they fall on top of each other. The study of it is new, however, and physicists debate the model that most accurately describes the mechanism. Thirty locations worldwide, including ones in China and the US, have singing sand, but none, experts say, has as pronounced and mellifluous a sound as the giant dunes in the south of the United Arab Emirates. This area is known as the Empty Quarter and stretches into Saudi Arabia. Local guides—who you will need if want to avoid getting lost in the tessellating sands, which can bewilder and quickly kill visitors—can take you to see and hear these mysterious dunes.  Drive from Abu Dhabi or Dubai south toward Liwa. The dunes surround the city, which is made up of small buildings along the edges of the desert. You'll likely go with a guide from another city or meet him at one of the hotels in Liwa."

At this outrageous supercar emporium, the exorbitant wealth of Ferrari is put on full display. Covering over 900,000 square feet, Ferrari World is the largest indoor theme park in the world, shaped like a massive three-pointed star when viewed from above, featuring a 215-foot version of Ferrari’s yellow prancing horse logo on the curved red roof. Inside the theme park, visitors have the opportunity to visit an operating Ferrari factory, take a spin on a real Ferrari, and wander through a gallery of 70 years of Ferrari models. The “Bell’Italia” ride takes visitors on a Ferrari ride through a miniature diorama of the marvels of Italy, including Venice, the Roman Colosseum, the Amalfi Coast, and, of course, Ferrari’s hometown of Maranello. Fittingly, the park is also home to the world’s tallest roller coaster loop and the famous “Formula Rossa,” a thrill ride that sets the world record for roller coaster speed with a maximum velocity of 149mph. Ferrari World has been dubbed one of the best tourist attractions in the Middle East, and is planning to expand the amusement park to Spain and Orlando in the coming years."
40,Al Bidya Mosque,"Al Bidya, United Arab Emirates",The oldest surviving mosque in the UAE has mysterious origins and unusual architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/al-bidya-mosque,"After visiting the new, futuristic skyscrapers in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Al Bidya Mosque is a respite in its simplicity. It’s the oldest extant mosque in the United Arab Emirates. Al Bidya is thought to date back to 1446, when it was built into the hillside between the Gulf and the Hajar Mountains, though new research proposes it may be over a century younger than originally believed. Because it’s made entirely of mud and stone, radiocarbon dating a precise age is impossible. The mosque is located near the village of Al Bidya in the east coast emirate of Fujairah. Its origins largely remain a mystery. Even local elders reportedly know little about its early history. Al Bidya is uniquely built, mainly because it has fewer domes than other mosques. It has four layered domes, each containing a central pillar to support the structure. While it now has modern lighting and air conditioning, the worn minbar (pulpit), niches for decoration or lighting, and tiny windows for lighting and ventilation echo to a bygone era. Modestly dressed tourists may visit this place of worship, which still features daily prayers. The surrounding area also includes old watchtowers, ruins of buildings, and market stalls where crafts are currently sold. The area is dotted with local flora. Make sure to wear attire appropriate for visiting a mosque."
41,The Dubai Frame,United Arab Emirates,The world's largest frame offers spectacular views of the city's past and present.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dubai-frame,"The Dubai Frame is an iconic structure that “frames” impressive views of Old and New Dubai. The world’s largest frame, it serves as a massive, metaphorical bridge that connects the emirate’s past with its opulent present. The landmark celebrates Dubai’s history, from its humble beginnings to its current glamor and prestige. Look north, and you’ll see Dubai’s older, more historic neighborhoods framed within the great shiny structure. Look south, and you’ll see the modern, glitzy buildings and flashy skyscrapers for which the city is so famous. You can do more than look through the massive frame. The glass, aluminum, steel, and reinforced concrete structure also doubles as an observation tower that boasts fantastic panoramic vistas. It stands 492 feet (150 meters) tall, basically giving you a birds-eye view of the bustling metropolitan hub that sprawls below it. Unfortunately, the frame is as controversial as it is impressive. Its design was the idea of architect Fernando Donis, who won an international competition held by the Dubai government. Though his idea (with a few tweaks) was chosen for the now-iconic landmark, Donis maintains he did not receive a contract or payment for his work, and sued the municipality for stealing his intellectual property.  It's a royal pain to get there if you're driving, as the roads are confusing around the park. The Dubai Frame is open all year round, including weekends and public holidays. Visiting hours may vary during the holy month of Ramadan, holidays, and public holidays, but its opening hours are typically from 9:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. Admission is AED 50 (about 14 USD)."

The hotel is part of one of the city’s major investment projects, Yas Island. The star attraction of Yas Island is the new F1 Yas Marina Circuit, which the hotel is built over. Two elliptical hotel towers are connected by bridges spanning directly over and above the F1 race circuit. Both towers are covered in a 217-meter curving, semi-transparent canopy, called the Grid Shell, which harbours the world’s largest LED lighting system. This LED lighted color-changing canopy is the key feature of the luxury hotel, and is visible from several kilometers away. Inside, the hotel features an equally modern design in its 499 rooms, and twelve dining and lounging venues. Even more spectacular, the hotel hosts a fascinating light show at night. The F1 circuit has been in operation since the 2009 season, and after the track in Bahrain is the second F1 circuit in the Middle East. When no races take place, the circuit gives everyone the possibility of experiencing the exhilarating speed given on an F1 circuit, either as a driver or a passenger experience. Close to the hotel and the race track is the motorsports-themed amusement park Ferrari World, the world’s first theme park by the sports car manufacturer. Once the Yas Island development project is completed, it will hold another theme park, a water park, two marinas, several hotels and two golf courses. In 2009, the World Travel Awards announced Yas Island to be the world’s premier tourism project."

The cluster of domed structures and has been classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. More than 500 of these tombs sit at the foot of Jebel Hafeet mountain. They look like small stone igloos baking in the Sun. Incredibly, some of the tombs still contain skeletal remains. These tombs and architectural remains are significant, as they are a rare and unique illustration of human development in the Bronze Age and the Iron Age on the Arabian Peninsula. The drive alone to get to the tombs is an adventure in itself. Although Jebel Hafeet mountain is accessible on the United Arab Emirates side via an excellently maintained road, the tombs are off-road.  Drive toward the Mezyad Oman border post. Exit the first right at the roundabout toward the Oasis International School. The road will become a dirt road. Drive along until you come to some camel farms. At the farms, turn right and then follow the vague tracks in the sand toward the mountain. Eventually, after some rocky terrain, you will see the tombs ahead. A strong 4x4 vehicle is an essential requirement. The abandoned Mezyad fort is roughly five minutes away."
44,Moreeb Dune,"Liwa, United Arab Emirates","One of the largest sand dunes in the world is nicknamed the ""Scary Mountain"" due to its steep slope and sharp incline.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/moreeb-dune,"Located about 155 miles from Abu Dhabi in the south central portion of the Arabian desert is the Moreeb Dune, also dubbed the “Scary Mountain.” The locals gave the huge sand hill its nickname because of the steep slope that makes it difficult to climb. It’s the largest sand hill in the country, and one of the largest in the world. Moreeb stands at a staggering 5,250 feet long, 984 feet high, and has a 50 degree slope. This steep incline makes the area perfect for the organized dune races that occur throughout the year. It’s also the home of a massive hill climbing competition every February. A cultural complex at the base hosts events and is a popular destination, even among those who don’t plan to actually make the trek up to the top of the dune. Visitors are welcome to try to climb Moreeb, but it is not an easy task. The view from the sandy summit is well worth the exertion. Patrons have also been known to sled down the dune once reaching the top. Good shoes and plenty of water and determination are needed for those up to the challenge."
45,Socotra Island,Yemen,The most alien-looking place on Earth.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/socotra-island,"The island of Socotra is part of an archipelago in the Indian Ocean. It is so isolated that a third of its plant life is found nowhere else on the planet. Notable are the dragon’s blood trees that look like flying saucers perched on trunks. Adenium socotranum are trees that look like elephants’ legs with pink flowers on top. Birds such as the Socotra starling, Socotra sunbird, and Socotra grosbeak are found nowhere else on Earth. Bats are the island’s only native mammal. In 2010 a Russian archaeological team discovered the ruins of a city on Socotra dating to the second century. The island is also held by some to be the location of the original Garden of Eden, due to its isolation, biological diversity, and the fact that it is located on the edge of Yemen’s Gulf of Aden, which many connect with the ancient Sumerian tales of a paradise called Dilmun. There are almost no roads on the island, which is also home to a collection of caves and a number of shipwrecks."
46,Shibam,"Shibam, Yemen","A city built from mud and known as the ""Manhattan of the desert.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shibam-hadhramaut,"Like Manhattan, the high-rises of Shibam were built on a rectangular grid of streets and squares. Unlike Manhattan, the skyscrapers are made of mud, date back to the 16th century, and the dusty streets are often overrun with goats. Shibam, in the desert of central Yemen, is home to about 7,000 people. Located at the crossroads of Asia, Africa, and Europe, the small town was once a stopping point for traders traveling along the frankincense and spice routes. The walled city of “skyscrapers” was built on a hill in the 1530s after a mighty flood destroyed much of the existing settlement. Its 500 huddled buildings, ranging from five to 11 stories high, are the tallest mud buildings in the world and provided protection against the elements and deterred potential attackers. They continue to shelter the residents of Shibam. The tower houses, however, are not immune to damage — fresh layers of mud must be applied to the walls regularly to replace sections eroded by wind and rain. A tropical storm in October 2008 brought disastrous floods, causing some of the buildings to collapse. An Al Qaeda attack in 2009 brought further damage."
47,Hababah Water Cistern,Yemen,A mesmerizing reservoir nestled at the heart of a pre-Islamic Yemeni village.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hababah-water-cistern,"Hababah was famous in the pre-Islamic world for being impenetrable. Little of the fortification remains today, but the houses and winding streets in this village retain the fascinating features reminiscent of Middle Eastern fairytales. A beautiful water cistern is nestled within the heart of the village. When calm, it reflects the surrounding stone houses like a fluid mirror. Watching the images of the buildings, with their colorful doors and ornate windows, ripple whenever a gentle breeze blows is mesmerizing. Cisterns are a classic feature in many of Yemen’s old settlements. Villagers carved the large pools out of the rock and used them to store rainwater. These reservoirs were a key water source within the parched desert and kept the land from flooding during downpours. Even today, the cisterns are bustling places within rural villages. Visit the cistern in Hababah, and you’ll see locals emerge at the water’s edge, buckets in hand, to haul the precious resource home. Don’t be surprised if you also see a few children splashing around in the pool."
48,Brick Buildings of Zabid,"Zabid, Yemen",Elaborate patterns adorn the city's disappearing traditional architecture.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brick-buildings-of-zabid,"Like many Yemeni towns, Zabid is an old, interesting city rich with cultural and religious artifacts. An intricate set of labyrinthine alleys criss-crosses the city, beyond which stand centuries-old clay brick houses. Their facades have beautifully elaborate stuccoed patterns that draw from Arabic, African, and Indian traditions. Keep an eye out for intricate abstract designs, floral patterns, animals, and calligraphy. These patterns also extend to the interior of some houses. Some buildings even feature the Star of David, which attests to Yemen’s Jewish tradition and Zabid’s past as a hub for culture and religion. The traditional buildings are constructed from a mix of clay and mud brick, limestone, and wood. Some even have thatched roofs. It’s a style of architecture that appears throughout the Tihama plain, but is most common in Zabid. Unfortunately, newer buildings are threatening some of its most exquisite traditional brick architecture. A worrying number of these historic houses have been replaced by concrete buildings inside the city walls. A small population boom after the Gulf War prompted people to either renovate the old buildings or replace them with newer structures. Some of the traditional houses that managed to survive tend to remain neglected due to poverty. According to UNESCO, around 40 percent of the city’s historic structures have been compromised, prompting it to put the city on its “List of World Heritage in Danger.” Zabid is one of the oldest settlements still inhabited in Yemen. Based on historical records, it was already in existence by 631 A.D. Zabid eventually became the capital of Yemen from the 13th to the 15th century. A thick wall surrounds and defines the boundaries of the city. The construction of the Great Mosque (Asa’ir) was started in the 9th century. It’s still standing in all its ancient majesty, and is just one of the city’s 86 mosques. With slightly more than 800 people living in the city, there is more than one mosque per 10 people, giving Zabid the highest concentration of mosques in Yemen."
49,Shaharah,"Shaharah, Yemen",One of the most remote and isolated villages on the Arabian Peninsula.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shaharah,"Shaharah is certainly not the only fortified mountain village in Yemen, but it is definitely among the most spectacular. At 2600m above sea level in the middle of a craggy mountain landscape of fissures and gorges, the town’s landscape is heaped in drama. The only approach to the village is via an impressive, arched stone bridge, which spans one of the mountain gorges. Its secluded position and its sole point of entry made Shaharah incredibly inaccessible. Water cisterns within the village and nearby terraced fields enabled the village to endure even lengthy sieges. For centuries, the village successfully withstood innumerable armies and conquerors. In fact, it wasn’t until the use of air force during the 1960s, in the Yemeni Civil War that the village’s isolated location was finally broken. Since the 9th century, the village also held a reputation of being an important place of Islamic learning, and scholars throughout the region in the town were well known. Unfortunately, the village is located in Northern Yemen, where the Shia Insurgency turned the region into a de facto war zone. For this reason, foreigners are currently discouraged from visiting the area. While the village itself is considered safe, the roads leading into this region are not. Unless you're a Yemeni citizen, a permit has to be obtained from the Police Department in Sana'a to travel to this location. In the very unlikely event that you manage to obtain a travel permit, make sure you make a dozen copies before you depart, as all the check points along the way will demand to see and retain a copy of the permit."
50,Dar al-Hajar,"Sana'a, Yemen","Yemen's ""Stone Palace"" looks like it was carved right out of the tall stone column on which it is built.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dar-alhajar,"While it may not be the Black-Forest-European-Fairytale-style construction that most Westerners consider when they think of a castle, Yemen’s Dar al-Hajar palace, built atop a tall natural rock spire is nonetheless fantastical. The Middle-Eastern-styled palace as it stands today was actually built relatively recently, in the 1930s by an Islamic spiritual leader named Yahya Muhammad Hamiddin, but it seems that he was building atop a preexisting structure that was built in the 1700s by an Islamic scholar. The tall castle was intended to be the leader’s summer home, and featured a number of facilities including appointment rooms for his highly appointed guests and separate spaces for cooling water in earthen jars. The rooms are built up the side of a tall rock spire, culminating in a grand tower at its pinnacle. The Imam Yahya was assassinated in 1948, but his iconic palace still stands and it has become a popular example of Yemeni architecture. While it is no longer used as a royal residence, the palace has been refitted as a museum and can be toured for a fee. Visitors can range about through the kitchens, storage rooms, and appointment rooms connected by a small labyrinth of stairways leading through the five-story structure. But as impressive as it is to explore inside, it is the view from the exterior that really makes the palace one of a kind. Combined with the natural rock on which it is built, it truly looks like a monumental work straight out of a fantasy novel. Head northwest out of town on the 313. Where the route goes left to Thula, do not take it but carry straight on to the castle."
51,Cisterns of Tawila,"Aden, Yemen","This impressive system of tanks was used to store drinking water as long as 2,000 years ago.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cisterns-of-tawila,"Meandering around the busy streets in Crater, Aden’s city center, one could forget that it has been a major geopolitical player for millennia. Its strategic position on the Europe-India sea route ensured that a thriving settlement existed at least as far back as 1,000 BC. Given the arid climate, it is fitting that this city is home to a complex ancient system of cisterns built to provide water for its residents. Nearly two millennia ago, the cisterns of Tawila were carved out of the volcanic rocks of the Shamsan mountains to collect and store rainwater and to prevent flooding in the crucial Yemeni city of Aden. The first mention of the drinking water cisterns can be found in some ancient manuscripts from the 7th century. This gives reason to believe the tanks are at least 1,500 years old, but most historians agree they are probably even older. The most credible theory is that the people known as Himyarites, who ruled Aden beginning in 115 BC, probably built the cisterns around that time, as they were known for constructing water-catchment structures in the areas they controlled. After being used for a few centuries, the water system was eventually abandoned. By the time the British, who had occupied Aden in 1829, discovered the deserted cisterns in the mid-19th century, the tanks were almost completely buried by debris. A British diplomat named Sir Robert L. Playfair is credited with cleaning up the ancient water basins and rehabilitating them as a source of fresh water for the port city. Of the original 53 cisterns, only 18 remain, and have a combined capacity of 19 million gallons. The largest are the Coghlan tank and the Playfair Tank, which is circular. These days, the cisterns are empty, but the site is open to visitors. The political instability in the area has taken its toll on the ancient infrastructure. This is not the first time in the nearly two millennia of their existence that the cisterns witnessed war and destruction, but they have survived thus far and will probably survive this crisis too."
52,Queen Arwa Mosque,"Jiblah, Yemen","One of Yemen’s oldest and most beautiful mosques was named for the incredible, historical queen buried inside it.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/queen-arwa-mosque,"Queen Arwa Mosque is one of the oldest and most beautiful mosques in Yemen. At the start of its construction in 1056, this building was not meant to be a mosque, but a palace. It was Queen Arwa who repurposed it. Queen Arwa is an extremely interesting figure in Yemeni history. Born in 1048 in Haraz, she was the niece of Yemen’s ruler. She lost both parents at a young age and was brought up by the royal side of her family in Sana’a. Described as beautiful, well-educated, and highly intelligent, Arwa at the age of 17 married her cousin Ahmad al-Mukarram bin Ali, thus acquiring the title of Sayyada Arwa. In accordance with the Yemeni rules of inheritance, Arwa’s husband become the ruler of Yemen, but, being unable to rule due to his poor health, he delegated all his powers and authority to Arwa, who co-reigned the state with her mother-in-law until she died in 1087. Holding a position of authority, Arwa did not shy away from her duties, which meant that she often had to mix with men—which was not unheard of, but is certainly a significant fact. The year 1087 was a turning point for Arwa, as she became the only de facto ruler of Yemen. One of her first actions was to move the capital of Yemen from Sana’a to Jibla, about 155 miles (250 kilometers) to the south of Sana’a. And one of the first actions Arwa took in Jibla was to repurpose Dar al-Ezz palace, which was still under construction at that point, into a mosque. After her first husband died in 1091, Arwa married her late husband’s cousin Saba ibn Ahmad. It seems that the marriage was a politically motivated, as by doing this, Arwa managed to maintain power and authority. When her second husband died in 1101, Arwa became the sole ruler, a position she retained until her death in 1138. She was buried in Queen Arwa Mosque, which became an important pilgrimage site for pious Yemenis. Queen Arwa Mosque, which stands as an architectural testimony to her legacy, has a rectangular base with an open courtyard delimited by four corridors running under archways. It is accompanied by two beautifully ornate minarets.  No matter which direction one arrives in Jibla from, Queen Arwa Mosque is impossible to miss. The mosque is still active today. Be sure to dress appropriately if you choose to visit."
53,Bayt Baws,"Sana'a, Yemen",A nearly abandoned Jewish settlement perched atop a hill in the heart of Yemen.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bayt-baws,"This nearly abandoned settlement is a perched on top of a hill. It has steep slopes on three sides that acted as a natural defense, leaving only the south side easily accessible, and this is where the only gate to the village is located. None of this is unique, though; you’ll find many similar hilltop villages throughout Yemen. What makes the village stand out is that it is a largely deserted Jewish settlement in the heart of Yemen. The village was founded by the Bawsites during the Sabaean Kingdom. When exactly the Jewish community first arrived in Yemen is a matter of contention. One theory holds that King Solomon sent some merchants to Yemen, and some of them settled down. Another theory says Yemeni tribes converted to Judaism after the Queen of Sheba paid a visit to King Solomon. And yet another theory pinpoints the arrival of the Jews in Yemen to 1451 BC. The only certainty is that the oldest archaeological record of a Jewish community residing in Yemen goes back to 110 BC. But though they’d been living in Yemen for centuries, most of the Yemeni Jewish community relocated to Israel in 1949 and 1950, during Operation Magic Carpet, and some more in 1959, while a minority moved to the United States. More people left the settlement of Bayt Baws in the 1990s, after urbanization caused the city of Sana’a to swallow the land around it. Today, Bayt Baws consists of neglected mud houses slowly disintegrating and narrow alleys meandering through compound walls. Most gates ushering into the courtyards are open. However, caution should be taken, as parts of the abandoned may be unsafe.  The best way to reach Bayt Baws is to hire a taxi from Sana’a. No one is guarding the gate, and anyone can enter Bayt Baws any time. Children from the settlement surrounding Bayt Baws are likely to follow you through the village."
54,Tower of Silence,"Aden, Yemen",The remains of a Zoroastrian temple that bore witness to a time when Aden was a flourishing trading hub.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tower-of-silence-aden,"The 19th century witnessed a flurry of trading activity throughout the Indian Ocean, and as a result, a sizable Parsee community became established in Aden. A Parsee businessman by the name of Cowasjee Dinshaw Adenwalla bankrolled the construction of a Temple of Fire accompanied by the Tower of Silence. Like other Zoroastrian towers of silence, this site was used as a form of burial known as excarnation. In this practice, the bodies of the deceased were left inside roofless towers, exposed to the elements and carrion birds—in this case, kites and crows. This enterprise culminated with the opening of the Adenwalla Agiary and consecration of the Holy Fire in 1883. In the 1960s, Yemen became the only country in the Middle East to set up a communist government. In view of these radical political changes, a debate began within the Parsee community whether the Holy Flame should be relocated. Once the decision was made, it took years of negotiations with the authorities to arrange for the transfer. In 1976, the Holy Flame finally boarded a plane and was taken to Lonavala, near Mumbai. Several unmarked trails lead to the hilltop, where the arches of the inner circle of the tower remain, from which there are commanding views of Crater neighborhood, the harbor and Sira Castle."
55,Minaret of Al-Muhdhar Mosque,"Tarim, Yemen",The tallest minaret in Yemen is 150 feet high and entirely made of mud.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/minaret-of-almuhdhar-mosque,"Located in Yemen’s Hadhramaut Valley, the ancient town of Tarim is widely recognized as a hub of religion, culture, and science, and in particular an important center for theological and juridical studies. The centerpiece of the historic town is the Al-Muhdhar Mosque or, to be more precise, its minaret. The mosque’s prominent white minaret—the narrow, pointed tower from which Muslims are called to prayer—rises to a height of over 150 feet, making it the tallest tower throughout Tarim, and in fact the tallest minaret in all of Yemen. Tarim is also a place where different architectural styles combine to create new aesthetics, and the minaret of Al-Muhdar Mosque is no exception. The minaret has a square base and an internal staircase leads all the way to the top of the structure, which, in accordance with the tradition of the region, it is entirely made of mud. Lime plaster covers the exterior of the minaret and gives it the bright white color that so stands out against the rocky mountain in the background. The unique minaret was designed by Abu Bakr bin Shihab and Alawi Al  Mash’hūr, two native writers, and its construction was completed in 1914. The mosque is named after Omar Al’Muhdar, a prominent Tarimi leader from the 15th century.  A special permit is needed to visit Hadhramaut, and you must have a military escort to visit Tarim."
56,The Monkey's Paw,"Toronto, Ontario","A book collector's dream, this Toronto bookstore has the world's first ""Biblio-Mat,"" a random book vending machine.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-monkey-s-paw-toronto-ontario,"All of the books lining the shelves of Stephen Fowler’s bookstore are ones you couldn’t possibly find anywhere else. Fowler opened The Monkey’s Paw in March 2006 and since then, it has been a haven for antiquarians, complete with medical drawings on the wall and a stuffed crow on a typewriter. The unusual store, named after a horror short story by author W.W. Jacobs, has old books that range from topics as diverse as the art of predicting female character traits according to breast shape to Canadian Egg Laying Contests. Fowler selects each book to fit these categories: the beautiful, the arcane, the macabre and the absurd. Monkey’s Paw also has a custom-made Biblio-Mat, a vending machine that will dispense a randomly selected vintage volume when a token is inserted. Tokens can be purchased from the checkout for $5 apiece.  There are no signs on the outside, you'll know you are close when you pass by Garfield Eats (a Garfield themed snack place). It's a very interesting walk to say the least."
57,Winter Garden Theatre,"Toronto, Ontario",A botanically themed auditorium blooms within the world’s last operating double-decker theater.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/winter-garden-theatre,"In this theater, leafy plants cascade downward, cloaking the ceiling in a veil of flora. Nature scenes adorn the walls, making each performance feel like an enchanting garden adventure. In 1913, a flagship theater for Marcus Loew’s chain was built in downtown Toronto. Unusually, the theater had two separate stages stacked on top of each other. The Elgin Theatre on the ground floor was traditionally decorated in red and gold with classical references, but the architect had a more novel idea for the Winter Garden seven stories above. Designed to bring the outside in, the walls were painted with murals of plants, trellises, and even the odd lamppost while the ceiling was covered with real dried leaves. As part of this whimsical fantasy-like decor, lights became lanterns and columns became tree trunks. The stage area itself represented the sky, complete with painted clouds and an illuminated Moon. Originally built to stage variety performances known as vaudeville, by the 1920s the rise of the film industry had reduced the popularity of the genre. Reacting to lower audience numbers, the Elgin Theatre was converted into a cinema. In 1928, however, after just 15 years in operation, the doors to the Winter Garden were simply locked. They would remain shut for the next 53 years. Continuing to cater to the movie market, the Elgin Theatre was fitted with a curved “Cinerama” screen in the 1960s which required removing the opera boxes. Curiously, the screen was never actually used and the damage was just covered with a curtain after the owners changed their minds. The fate of the building continued to decline and by the 1970s, this once-grand theater complex was best known for showing softcore porn movies. The last ever film shown there was What the Swedish Butler Saw in the early 1980s. Threatened with demolition, the Ontario Heritage Trust stepped in and purchased the venues in 1981. With a budget of $29 million, conservation specialists, and an army of volunteers, the two theaters were painstakingly restored, including cleaning of the original paint work with raw bread dough and weaving of over 5,000 beech branches back into the garden ceiling. Now a working theater once again, the Elgin and Winter Garden is the world’s only example of a double-decker Edwardian theater still in operation.  A 90-minute paid guided tour is available on Mondays year-round, and the building is usually open for free during the Doors Open festival in May. Alternatively, book a show and experience the theaters as they were originally intended! Shows are rare, usually only 0-3 per month. If you’re lucky, you might even be able to ride in one of the original hand-operated elevators!"
58,The Enchanted Forest,"Malakwa, British Columbia",An old world fairytale-land with over 350 fairy folk figurines hidden amongst 800 year old cedars.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/enchanted-forest-british-columbia,"Artist Doris Needham and her husband Ernest needed a place to put her hand-sculpted cement creations, so they bought a forest and filled it with enchanted figures from fairytales and nursery rhymes. During the 1950s, they cleared trails and constructed rock walls over 8 acres with nothing but hand tools. Ernest built them a little home that looked a bit like a gingerbread house, and installed a gravity water system using the waterfall across the highway, which is still in use today. When Rogers Pass opened, traffic began being diverted through the Needhams’ unusual haven, and in 1960 they decided to officially open up their Enchanted Forest to the public. What was once just a project they enjoyed together to invent their own happy place for their retirement was now a highly popular tourist spot for sightseers. One could not drive by and resist dragons and pirates lurking on boulders and behind trees, dwarves and fairies sharing the pools at the foot of waterfalls, or the adorable Candy Cane house belonging to the couple that created it all. By 1970, a million people had stopped to visit the castle and marvel at the statues and tree houses and all the other surprises nestled in the Needhams’ forest. The couple realized that it had become unmanageable, and their retirement idea had turned into a challenging full time job. Wanting to enjoy the fruits of their labor before it was too late, Doris and Ernest sold their forest to Rocky and Juliet Ehlers and their children, Aza, Silas and Naomi. Fortunately, the Ehlers loved the Enchanted Forest for what it was, and have continued to care for it and keep it available to visitors. The forest is full of twists and turns, each corner revealing a new small cottage with ferns growing on the roof, or a favorite nursery character sitting on a wall, full of whimsy. They boast over 350 figurines, a pirate ship, and the tallest treehouse in British Columbia. The forest itself is a beautiful site, with beaver ponds for boating, 800 year-old cedars, salmon spawning and moose and caribou sightings during migration months.  The Enchanted Forest is located midway between Sicamous and Revelstoke, British Columbia: 32 km (20 mi) West on Highway 1 from Revelstoke, and 35 km (21 mi) East on Highway 1 from Sicamous. From Kamloops or Kelowna BC, the Enchanted Forest is 2.5 hours hours East. Admission is $14 for adults, various other rates for seniors, children, group, etc."
59,Casa Loma,"Toronto, Ontario",A 98-room castle in the middle of Toronto that bankrupted a 19th century electricity multimillionaire.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casa-loma,"Sir Henry Mill Pellatt, a Canadian soldier and financier, gained immense wealth from founding the Toronto Electric Light Company in 1883, which brought electricity to the streetlights of Canada’s largest city. Business boomed – soon he was the chairman of 21 companies, owned railroads, generated electricity from Niagara Falls, and was knighted for his military service. His monopoly grew for a full 28 years until 1911, when everything started going downhill. Pellatt, who had been intrigued by castles since visiting Europe in his teenage years, decided to use his fortune of $17 million (modern-day $412 million) to build a personal château in the middle of Toronto. This 98-room castle, named Casa Loma, cost nearly 2 million man-hours and $3.5 million to build, including a whopping $50,000 a year for 40 live-in staff and $250,000 just to put the names of his horses in 18-carat gold — and that’s all in 1911 dollars. In retrospect, it’s no surprise that Pellatt went bankrupt pretty quickly. By 1920, the Canadian electricity market was made publicly owned (destroying his main source of income), and the economy was in a slump from the end of World War I. Pellatt owed over a million dollars to the Home Bank of Canada and was in so much debt that he sold everything he could, for an average of 17% of its original cost. Garden vases for $16, two brass sundials for $25, and a $75,000 pipe organ for $40 (despite the auctioneer giving it a rendition of “Auld Lang Syne”). To sum it up, in the words of Canadian politician Charles Henderson, “a Persian rug for the price of a doormat.” Sadly for Pellatt, he eventually had to sell his palace and move out. Nowadays, Casa Loma is owned by the city and has become a museum and tourist attraction for visitors to Toronto. Although Pellatt sold its bear skin rugs, bronze buffalo head, and the grand marble fountain featuring statues of children holding up a dolphin, Casa Loma still holds many of its original attributes. This includes the 10,000-book library, the plant-filled conservatory complete with a marble floor and a stained glass ceiling, the 60-foot-tall Great Hall with wooden chandeliers and sculpted figures on its pillars, the beautiful gardens abounding with flowers, and the mahogany stables built with a Spanish tile floor suited for the hooves of the horses. The castle had three indoor bowling alleys, a rifle range, a built-in vacuum system, a plethora of bronze doors, two secret, multi-floor passageways, a never-completed swimming pool now filled with gravestones, and 30 bathrooms (one of the showers contained six different showerheads for a full-body spray). Casa Loma serves as both an ostentatious landmark and a reminder to manage our money wisely. Many movies have been filmed here including some of the X-Men movies."
60,Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library,"Toronto, Ontario",One of Canada's most incredible rare book collections holds hundreds of thousands of gorgeous tomes that the general public can touch.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thomas-fisher-rare-books-library,"Arguably one of the most fascinating libraries in Canada, the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library houses the Rare and Special collections of the University of Toronto. The library strives to preserve these collections while making them entirely accessible to the public – any visitor may request to personally view and handle the library’s holdings. While it is nearly impossible to encapsulate the wealth of material stored in the library, which holds around 700,000 volumes and 3,000 meters of manuscripts, a few collections stand out. One of the more intriguing groups of books is a fantastic collection of “monster” volumes spanning from reprints of ancient works to 18th-century catalogs. These include Cicero’s Book of Natural History (you can view an edition from 1551) , Ulysses Androvandi’s Monstroum Historiae (1642) and Palfijn’s version of Licetus’ Book of Monsters (1708). For those more interested in medical obscura, the library also holds a large collection of anatomical works, including that of the famous anatomist Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564). Many of these anatomical volumes have been made accessible as part of the library’s digital collection - the online Anatomia collection alone features 4,500 digitized images representing works dating from 1522 to 1867. Other collections include a treasure trove of beautiful Alice in Wonderland editions, numerous historical printings of Shakespeare’s works, and a small cache of ancient papyrus writings. For those who wish to visit the library, but are less sure of what materials they would like to view, the library also curates monthly exhibits to showcase parts of the collection. You can also follow the library on Facebook and Youtube for a glimpse at new acquisitions and upcoming exhibitions, as well as an extensive Flickr page filled with images of their current holdings.   Visitors interested in viewing books, manuscripts, and other materials--outside of those currently on display by the library--must submit formal requests on the website. Visitors must provide photo identification and fill out paperwork to obtain a reader card, which is necessary in order to have their material requests reviewed and granted by the library. A catalog of available items can be found on the library's website. It is not necessary to be affiliated with the University of Toronto; the library and its collection are available to the public."
61,VanDusen Garden's Elizabethan Hedge Maze,"Vancouver, British Columbia",This Elizabethan hedge maze is one of only six in North America.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vandusen-garden-s-elizabethan-hedge-maze,"Mazes and labyrinths have fascinated people from before the dawn of history. The legendary labyrinth beneath the Palace of Knossos on the island of Crete, in which the hero Theseus killed the Minotaur, is perhaps the best known of the early mazes. Other mazes were made by the people of northern Europe, perhaps to confuse evil spirits or symbolically thread the difficult path of life. The hedge maze reached its zenith as a form in Renaissance England, more as a device for entertainment than serious purpose. The most famous was built by Cardinal Wolsley at Hampton Court. Today VanDusen Garden in Vancouver, Canada carries on the tradition with one of only six Elizabethan hedge mazes in North America. The maze is made of 3,000 pyramidal cedars – Thuja occidentalis ‘Fastigiata’ to be specific – all planted in the autumn of 1981 and slowly grown into the form of the maze one finds today. Named for local lumber magnate and philanthropist Whitford Julian VanDusen, the gardens are run jointly by the Vancouver Park Board and a non-profit volunteer association. They are open to the public every day of the year except Christmas. In addition to the maze, the gardens cover 55 acres and display plants from around the world. There is an observation terrace from which the less adventuresome visitor can view the maze and the struggles of its confused occupants."
62,Biosphere of Montreal,"Montreal, Québec","Designed by Buckminster Fuller, this relic of the 67 Expo survived fire and ice.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/biosphere-of-montreal,"As their contribution to Montreal’s 1967 World’s Fair Exposition the United States government commissioned architect, scientist, and well-known genius Buckminster Fuller to design a pavilion for the Canadian exhibition. Fuller, who popularized, perfected, and named the Geodesic Dome, designed a 20-story-tall dome in the fashion of his hallmark design to represent the USA. Done in a full two-thirds sphere, rather than the typical half dome, the massive steel structure was seen and admired by over 5.6 million visitors who went into the dome to see exhibits from actual spaceships from the Apollo missions to American works of art.  The dome’s steel skeleton was fitted with a clear acrylic covering, making the structure look like a massive, glittering jewel. When the fair ended, the pavilion remained. The dome was originally meant to be bolted together, allowing the pavilion to be dismantled when the fair was finished, but budget constraints led workers to weld the dome together instead, securing the dome’s place in Montreal’s landscape. The sphere would remain open to the public for nine years until an accident involving some routine welding maintenance caused the acrylic covering to catch fire, engulfing the entire sphere in a spectacular ball of fire with flames that burned for 30 minutes. When the flames subsided, there was no sign of the acrylic walls to be seen, but the steel trusses of the dome remained. After the fire, the dome was closed to the public for over fifteen years. In June 1995, the dome rose from the ashes and was re-purposed as a museum devoted to environmental action. The reopened dome sported no acrylics on its exterior this time around, due to the costs of keeping the gigantic dome warm and cool, and probably to prevent future accidents. However, the dome was hit with another disaster in 1998 when an ice storm forced the biosphere to close for five months. The biosphere reopened, and still houses the museum. Through the fire and Canadian ice storms, the Biosphere of Montreal remains, a sturdy and beautiful example of “Bucky’s” geodesic architecture.

63,Free Spirit Spheres,"Qualicum Beach, British Columbia",Sleep snuggled in a sphere suspended atop the forest canopy of Vancouver Island.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/free-spirit-spheres,"Somewhere in the middle of the forest on Vancouver Island, you’ll find large wooden orbs suspended from the trees. Take the spiral staircase and short suspension bridge leading up to them and enter into the sphere to experience nature from a different perspective. Designed to look vaguely like enormous nuts or seeds, the cedar and spruce spheres borrow from and collaborate with the surrounding environment. The suspension mimics spider webs by attaching to several different strong points among the trees. The spheres are made of fiberglass and wood and borrow heavily from sailboat and construction methods. Inside the curving walls complete with portholes for windows, space is maximized with fold-out tables and mirrors, curved loft beds and benches, and tiny appliances. Touted as “the ultimate tree-house experience,” these free spirit spheres can be rented overnight. If you just want to see them, book an appointment as they are on private property."
64,Allan Gardens Conservatory,"Toronto, Ontario","The Victorian-era greenhouse is stuffed with tropical plants, and open 365 days a year.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/allan-gardens,"Even on Toronto’s most bitterly blustery days, it’s balmy inside the Allan Gardens Conservatory. Its greenhouses are home to orchids, bromeliads, cacti, succulents, and—beneath a soaring glass dome—banana trees and palms. The horticultural center first sprouted in 1858, with a five-acre plot of land donated to the Toronto Horticultural Society by the politician George William Allan. By 1879, the site housed a wood, iron, and glass conservancy, which hosted galas, concerts, and flower shows. Then, a fire licked through in 1902. For several minutes, “the cracking of the flames was relieved by the curious tinkling sounds of thousands of falling panes” fracturing from the ceiling, the Ottawa Journal reported at the time. Most of the structure’s “carefully treasured trees and shrubs from the tropics,” were “more or less damaged by the heat, and the necessarily rough usage in removing them,” the paper continued. Many of the plants were scorched to a crisp, and the structure itself was reduced to “a heap of ruins.” A new crop took root when the Palm House dome opened in 1910. Over the years, branching greenhouses have been tacked on to its sides, so the whole structure now spans 16,000 square feet. The garden has been the site of political activism, too. The National Council of Women of Canada, which agitated for suffrage, immigration, and other policies, was founded on the site in 1893. The grounds have also been the site of protests against poverty and nuclear weapons, and a violent skirmish erupted in 1965, when a handful of suspected Nazi sympathizers were beaten in front of a crowd of thousands. It was also the site of a rally to protest the G20 summit. For several years, it’s been the terminus of Dyke March celebrations. Visitors who arrive in December or early January might encounter the Conservatory’s holiday flower show. For the past 40 years, this annual festival has nodded to the Victorian era. The gardens’ regular cast of greenery is joined by a rotating roster of special players, such as topiary sleighs, reindeer, and parlor scenes, featuring a hearth, a penguin playing a mossy piano, and a flouncy dress made with boughs of fir. When the holiday show closes up, these give way to other seasonal shows, including one to herald spring with hundreds of hydrangeas and Easter lilies."
65,Habitat 67,"Montreal, Québec",This 1967 experiment in modular architecture was designed to be a new model for urban living.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/habitat-67,"When you go to Montreal, there’s a strange building on the waterfront that’ll catch your eye. Or maybe that’s what drew you to the city in the first place. Habitat 67 was designed by Moshe Safdie as his graduate thesis while an architecture student at McGill University, and was later built to temporarily house workers, who came from all over the world, to work on Expo 67, the 1967 World’s Fair. The design is an experiment in modular architecture meant to imitate an organic growth, bringing together nature and geometric patterns. It’s in the metabolism style that was popular in Japan in the 1960s, commonly associated with the Nakagin Capsule Tower. While often called a Brutalist masterpiece, Safdie insists instead that it is actually a reaction against the Brutalist movement at that time. Safdie designed the Habitat for people in the middle class, as a way to improve quality of life in an urban environment. Each unit had access to a private garden, most of which were literally built on top of the roof of a neighboring apartment. Each of the 354 identical pre-fabricated boxes were constructed at a factory built next door that was opened specifically to build the models. The boxes created 158 apartments between 1 and 4 bedrooms (since reduced to 148 due to some being combined into larger units). Living in the Habitat has never been cheap. With a final cost of $22 million, it ended up running massively over budget, resulting in the government-owned building asking for unusually high rental rates in order to recoup the costs of construction. Consider this: In 1968 average rents in Montreal were a few hundred dollars for an entire house, but the Habitat was asking for closer to $1,000 per one bedroom unit. Today, the Habitat is one of the premier addresses in Montreal. Habitat was (and still is) far from the city center, located in an industrial area near no conveniences like the Metro, shopping centres, or even other homes. This is ironic considering that Safdie’s original plan called for a much larger community with 1,000+ apartments, shops, and even a school. Many critics of the Habitat believe that the intended purpose of the community was to provide affordable homes for the lower classes and point to the extraordinarily expensive apartments as proof of its failure. In fact, Safdie has stated from the start that Habitat was built for the middle class as a way to provide suburban-type housing within an urban environment — a new model for city living. Habitat 67 is still home to hundreds of Montreal residents.  The area isn't served by public transit, so the best option is to drive or prepare for a long walk. One of the easiest ways of getting there is to take the metro over to Parc Jean-Drapeau (be sure to catch Buckminster Fuller's biosphere) and walk over the Pont de la Concorde. Sadly, the apartments are highly exclusive and the property is well guarded, but you can buy tickets and get the guided tour, which includes access to the architect's apartment. Guided tours are from May to October and are usually sold out in advance so book early. Another option is to rent a bicycle from the bike-sharing program in Montreal to cycle to Habitat 67. This is how I travelled to Habitat 67 a few years ago. Unless you take the tour, it is not possible to walk around. Regardless, for fans of the architecture of Habitat 67, it is well worth a pilgrimage."
66,Sewers of Toronto,"Toronto, Ontario",A well-preserved network of cavernous tunnels have spent silent centuries removing Toronto's waste.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sewers-of-toronto,"It takes a truly special set of circumstances to turn sewage into a landmark. Or, more appropriately, to turn the path it takes to sewage heaven into a landmark. Large cities have elaborate sewer networks by necessity. Well-planned cities have expertly designed and maintained sewers. And very old cities have large, cavernous sewers that are the stuff legends are made of. No single one of these qualities makes a sewer worth visiting, or even possible to visit. But together, they create a secret underworld begging to be explored. Toronto is one of the few cities that check all of the boxes above and more, making their subterranean waste management network something magical to behold. Old, well-maintained, and elaborate, the sewage tunnels in Toronto are just the way fiction has always imagined a sewer should be: wide and high-ceilinged, perfectly sized for escaping bank robbers, or a group of teenage mutant ninja turtles. Toronto’s sewer tunnels are so large and well-built, they look more like soggy subway tunnels than rivers of wastewater. The resulting intrigue has created a subculture of urban exploration around subterranean Toronto. Daring adventurers and mischievous youths have long ventured into the city’s underground passageways to map their trajectory and examine their current state. Each leg of the sewer system has its own story. The Garrison Creek Sewer running underneath the west end of the city, smoothly beveled and circular like a pneumatic tube, was once literally a creek. In the late 1800s, once the creek became highly trafficked with human waste, the city wisely thought it best to just go ahead and bury the creek. Looking at it now, however, it’s shocking to think of it as once being a natural above ground waterflow, and just as shocking to think that is over 100 years old. Entrances to the tunnels are exactly where you’d expect them to be—manholes, maintenance shafts, spillways and water treatment offshoots—though, unsurprisingly, entry isn’t allowed. Visits are granted only with permission and guidance by a public works employee. They literally do not make them like these anymore, and the tunnels are an unsung marvel of public engineering. Toronto is a city that takes its sewage seriously, as evidenced by the ornate water treatment plant nicknamed “The Palace of Purification,” which is where all the contents of these intriguing tunnels end up.  Sewers can carry human sewage and/or stormwater. Exploring is off-limits and can be dangerous due to flash floods and toxic sewer gases. Do not trespass and don't proceed without a guide."
67,Othello Tunnels,"Hope, British Columbia","Railways may have forged this quintet of lovely tunnels, but now they are open to hikers.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/othello-tunnels,"Driving through solid rock, these lovely Canadian tunnels are the remnants of a former train system, but can now be trekked through on foot. The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) constructed the Kettle Valley Railroad (KVR) to link up the Kootenay region of British Columbia with the Southern coast. In 1914, the CPR saw fit to construct a series of five tunnels through the Coquihalla River Canyon as part of the KVR. Andrew McCulloch was appointed Chief Engineer from 1910-1916 to complete the KVR, which proved to be the most challenging project of his career. With sheer vertical walls and harsh winters, the conditions for the workers weren’t ideal. Cliff ladders, suspension bridges, and simple ropes were all used to give them access to the sections they worked on. Once the tunnel system was decommissioned, the path through the Othello Tunnels became a popular trail, and they are now officially part of the Trans-Canada trail system. Technically the area is called the Coquihalla Canyon Provincial Park, but most just call it The Othello Tunnels.  A fan of Shakespeare, McCulloch named the stations after characters from The Bard’s works, and the tunnels earned their popular name from this inspiration. The tunnels are regularly closed each winter due to unsafe conditions, and occasionally even in the summers if there are too many rock slides, but if you really need to see the tunnels, they can be seen in the movies, Rambo: First Blood and Cabin In The Woods."
68,Capilano Suspension Bridge,"North Vancouver, British Columbia",This expansive bridge in the Canadian wilderness was originally just built for friends.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/capilano-suspension-bridge-2,"After sending a team of horses swimming across the Capilano River with a long rope in tow, the builder of the original Capilano Suspension Bridge could never have dreamed that his simple span would become a world-class attraction. Built in 1889 by Scottish civil engineer George Grant Mackay, the 460-foot bridge was constructed of hemp rope and cedar planks. Once the bridge was in place, Mackay’s property became popular among his friends who took the name “the Capilano Tramps” to mark themselves as the adventurous types who would dare cross the swaying bridge. The crude original version was upgraded to a wire cable bridge in 1903. Then in 1910, the property was sold and began changing hands across the years as each subsequent owner built the bridge’s reputation as a world-class adventure tourism destination. The span was completely rebuilt in 1956 and is now under the purview of a small chain of rustic tourist attractions. The Capilano Suspension Bridge continues to draw huge crowds of visitors every year and is ranked as one of Vancouver’s most popular destinations. Additions have been made to the park to increase the visitor experience. On the west side of the bridge is the Treetop Adventures Canopy Walk, which consists of eight wooden bridges suspended between a number of huge Douglas Fir trees over 100 feet in the air. Bridges are secured to the trees not through nails or bolts that would damage the trees, but through specially engineered steel collars.  Once removed, these collars will have done no damage to the host trees at all. In 2011, the vertigo-inducing Cliffwalk opened on the east side of the canyon.  Pinned straight into the rock cliffs, the Cliffwalk is a series of secure and narrow walkways jutting out from the cliffs, through the trees, and over the river. Providing excellent views of the Suspension Bridge itself and the river below, as well as the trees growing out of the cliffs, and the surrounding forest, the Cliffwalk is a unique way to appreciate, and feel the thrill, of the West Coast. Not bad for something that started as a simple bridge built to entertain friends.  During the festive period (November to January), Capilano Suspension Bridge sees an increase in footfall, visitors are drawn in by the hundreds of lights which are draped over the bridge and the surrounded treetops. Arrive early and wrap up warm. None of the attractions at Capilano Suspension Bridge Park are wheelchair accessible and strollers are not permitted. Any visitor on crutches or in a wheelchair receives complimentary entry admission. Plan at least 2 hours to fully experience the park, more if you stay for lunch.The park offers a free shuttle from various locations in downtown Vancouver throughout the day, or Vancouver Public transit also services the area."
69,Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden,"Vancouver, British Columbia",Traditional 15th century Chinese garden in the middle of Vancouver.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dr-sun-yat-sen-classical-chinese-garden,"Hidden behind a low white building in the middle of Vancouver’s Chinatown is the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden. The Garden, which is named for the father of modern China, is a collaboration between Canada and the People’s Republic of China. It was designed by fifty-two craftsmen from Suzhou and their Canadian counterparts, with funding provided by private, public, and government organizations from both countries. The structure is based on the garden homes of Ming Dynasty scholars and officials and is the first such garden constructed outside of China. Chinese gardens are like horticultural mosaics, packed with colors and strange surprises: winding paths, lily pads glimpsed through the leaves of a willow tree, moongates, a sudden flash of gold in the water as a fish swims by. It is deliberately designed this way, designed so that every view of the garden is a different one; the entire thing can never be seen at once. The ultimate goal of the Garden is to create a space based on Chinese philosophy, incorporating the ideas of Feng Shui, Taosim, and yin and yang to achieve perfect balance. The Garden is also “based on the harmony of four main elements: rock, water, plants, and architecture,” and juxtaposes vital herbs and plants, waterways, and mountains with buildings that blend into the organic elements. Regular events in the garden include concerts, yoga lessons, and tai chi lessons. It also has a variety of unusual and seasonal events. In June, it hosts the Vancouver Storytelling Festival. In October, the Vancouver Chinese Instrumental Society presents a Fiddles Around the World Concert. In the winter, the Garden holds the Secret Lantern Society’s Winter Solstice Lantern Festival. Other landmarks include seasonal plants: plum trees in the spring, jasmine in the winter and lotuses in the summer. The weathered limestone rocks were imported from Lake Tai near Suzhou and look different in different lights. The jade green pond is full of golden koi fish. The Penjing garden houses small trees that are 100 years old; they are known as “silent poems.” There are also many places to stop and rest; the Garden’s pavilions range from the small Han Bi Xie, or Jade Water Pavilion, which floats on the pond, to the Hua Feng Tang, or China Maple Hall, which plays host to many of the center’s meetings and events. One of the highlights of the garden is Julian Law, a 92-year-old Chinese guide with a Scottish name, who points out the highlights of the garden while also expounding at length on ancient philosophy, the global economy, etiquette rules, and Chinese history. “Listen for Beethoven in the waterfalls,” he suggests earnestly, “and please feel free to converse with the rocks.” His tour ends in the Hall of One Hundred Rivers (Bai Chuan Tang), where visitors can sip oolong tea, play mahjong and practice Chinese calligraphy.

70,Riverview Hospital,"Coquitlam, British Columbia",Historic psychiatric asylum and most-filmed location in the Great White North.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/riverview-hospital,"The stigma of mental illness is such that there seems to be an unavoidable sense of tragedy and trepidation evoked by psychiatric hospitals. One can’t help but wonder, what untold stories could be uncovered from the relics of an institution that has witnessed the torment of so many personal demons? Dating back to the early 1900s, Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam, British Columbia, has treated psychiatric survivors until as recently as the summer of 2010. West Lawn Pavilion, the first of the Riverviews’ character buildings, opened in 1913 and was home to B.C.’s most psychotically disturbed male patients. Since its closure in 1983, West Lawn is the most frequently visited and photographed abandonment on the property. From the hauntingly desolate images posted online by urban explorers and ghost hunters, it’s hard to imagine that Riverview Hospital is also home to a thriving arboretum of over 1,900 trees and a diverse wildlife population that includes black bears, bobcats, coyotes, black-tailed deer, and over 80 bird species. From its inception in 1904, Riverview was intended to serve as both a mental health facility accommodating overflow from Victoria’s Royal Jubilee Hospital and as a botanical garden for the province of British Columbia. The government purchased 1,000 acres of Coquitlam farmland to accomplish this ambitious goal, though the botanical garden was eventually relocated to the University of British Columbia. Now fully decommissioned and abandoned - with the hospital’s remaining 201 patients transferred as of July 2010 - the buildings at Riverview face an unknown fate. Over the years, the 1,000 sprawling acres initially allotted for the hospital have been reduced to 244 acres as large sections have been transformed into the Riverview Heights housing development, Colony Farm Regional Park, and Riverview Forest Park. Concerned about potential demolition for market development, advocates for Riverview are pushing for continued psychiatric care for the province’s mentally ill as well as public commitments to preserve the site’s historic 20th-century architecture and lush ecosystem. In the meantime, with its eerie decrepit interiors and serene landscape, Riverview remains Canada’s most highly scouted film location. In recent years, the hospital’s West Lawn, East Lawn (formerly the Female Chronic Unit), and Crease Clinic buildings have been the backdrop for such productions as Saw, Watchmen, Smallville, Fringe, Dark Angel, The X Files, Supernatural, Romeo Must Die, and Along Came A Spider. In April 2009, Riverview was officially recognized on the Canadian Register of Historic Places. The Riverview premises are currently under the surveillance of security personnel from the Paladin Security Group. Given the recent closures, it is uncertain whether tours will still be available via the Riverview Hospital Museum and the Riverview Horticultural Centre Society."
71,Notre Dame Basilica,"Montreal, Québec",A grand Gothic Revival basilica with stained glass depictions of Montreal's religious history has only one soul resting in its crypt.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/notre-dame-basilica,"The Notre Dame Basilica is anything but ordinary, and credit for its splendor goes to the only person buried in its crypt - the man who built it. In 1824, the Montreal flock had outgrown its church, and it was time for something bigger and better. Commissioned to design a new place for the congregation to call home, Irish-American James O’Donnell, a New York Protestant, had a grand vision. Obsessed with the intricate, dramatic trappings of the Gothic Revival architecture movement, O’Donnell took the style and ran with it. Seas of color, intricate carvings, and ornate stained glass covers palatial floors and soaring ceilings in the spectacular church that remained the largest in North America for over 50 years. The church was so decadent a smaller, more modest chapel was built behind it for more practical use. Another noteworthy attraction of this breathtaking basilica is its famous Casavant Frères pipe organ - 92 electropneumatic action stops, 4 keyboards, and a sound-bending 7,000 individual pipes. This massive instrument of heavenly chorus put Casavant Frères on the map as master organ builders back in 1891. James O’Donnell, his architectural peak reached with the fabulous Notre Dame, wished to be buried inside the walls of his magnum opus, but there was one hitch - he wasn’t a Catholic. On his deathbed, O’Donnell converted, and now remains the only corpse residing in the magnificent crypt of his own design.  Métro Take the Orange line to Place d’Armes Station. Exit on Saint-Urbain Street and walk uphill toward Place D’Armes Square. Bus Take southbound Saint-Laurent bus No. 55. Get off at the Notre-Dame Street stop east of the Basilica.

72,Hidden Beach,"Islas Marietas, Mexico","A lovers' beach, tucked below the surface of the island, provides a safe haven for romance.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hidden-beach-playa-del-almor,"A gaping hole in the surface of the lush green island opens onto a secret beach, with ample shade, sun, and crystal-clear water. Playa del Amor, commonly known as the Hidden Beach, is a feature of one of the Marieta Islands, located some 22 nautical miles west of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, at the mouth of Banderas Bay. It looks like something out of a fantasy novel: a wide, sandy cavern with the blue waters of the Pacific rushing in. The Marieta Islands is a group of uninhabited islands formed by underwater volcano eruptions. They are natural wonders, but it was something other than the volcanic activity that brought the burrowed beach to light. It is rumored that the hole that created the Hidden Beach was a result of deliberate bombings. The Marieta Islands have always been completely uninhabited, making them ideal sites for military testing by the Mexican government. Beginning in the early 1900s, weapons and artillery were tested on the Marieta Islands, a safe distance from Mexican citizens but not so safe for Marieta topography. Test bombs are the known cause for many caves and rock formations on the island, possibly including the Hidden Beach. In the 1960s, scientist Jacques Cousteau led a protest against harmful human activity on the islands. In 2005, the islands were finally named a national park, Parque Nacional Islas Marietas, making swimming, kayaking, sunbathing, and other forms of recreation the only activity, and prohibiting hunting and fishing around the islands. Also, later on, the park was designated as a UNESCO MAB Biosphere Reserve. Extensive military testing damaged flora and fauna on the island for decades, but many years of peace have replenished the islands’ pristine waters and marine life. The Hidden Beach is invisible from the outside and is only accessible through a long water tunnel that links the beach to the Pacific Ocean. There is approximately six feet of space above water level, so visitors can arrive at the beach by swimming or kayaking. The islands remain uninhabited but are frequently visited by tourists who come to enjoy the diverse marine wildlife and the unique tropical Eden of Playa del Amor.  The islands are an hour long boat ride northwest from the coast of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. There are ample tour companies that provide day excursions to the Hidden Beach. Wristbands to the ""hidden beach"" are limited and must be reserved a few days in advance. Several tour companies can provide the trip for about 1500 pesos each. Tours can also be made without the hidden beach which are still fun for about 500 pesos each."
73,La Isla de las Muñecas (Island of the Dolls),"Mexico City, Mexico","An island filled with hundreds of hanging, decomposing, decapitated dolls.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-isla-de-las-munecas,"There is a disturbing circular nature to the story of “La Isla de la Muñecas,” or the Island of the Dolls. Over fifty years ago, Don Julian Santana left his wife and child and moved onto an island on Teshuilo Lake in the Xochimilco canals. According to some, a young girl actually drowned in the lake, while most others, including his relatives, say Don Julian Santana merely imagined the drowned girl. Regardless, Don Julian Santana devoted his life to honoring this lost soul in a unique, fascinating, and—for some—unnerving way: he collected and hung up dolls by the hundreds. Eventually, Don Julian transformed the entire island into a kind of bizarre, (for some) horrifying, doll-infested wonderland. Don Julian Santana began collecting lost dolls from the canals and the trash near his island home. He is also said to have traded produce he grew to locals for more dolls. Santana did not clean up the dolls or attempt to fix them, but rather put them up with missing eyes and limbs, covered in dirt, and generally in whatever ramshackle state he found them in. Even when dolls arrived in good shape, the wind and weather turned them into cracked and distorted versions of themselves. Don Julian also kept his cabin filled with the dolls, which he dressed in headdresses, sunglasses, and other accoutrement. Despite the fact that most people found the isle frightening, Don Julian saw the dolls as beautiful protectors, and he welcomed visitors, whom he would show around, charging a small fee for taking photos. In 2001 Don Julian Santana was found drowned in the same area in which he believed the little girl had died.  Located in the Xochimilco borough 17 miles south of the center of Mexico City. Best way to get there is to leave from Embarcadero Cuemanco. It's four hours round trip and cost $1,400 MEX or roughly $75 US dollars. Keep an eye out for some of the wildlife during your boat trip. Commonly seen creatures include pelicans, king fishers, egrets, and several species of water snakes."
74,El Nido de Quetzalcóatl,"Naucalpan, Mexico",An Aztec snake god has taken the material form of an apartment complex.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/quetzalcoatl-s-nest,"Northwest of Mexico City the feathered Aztec serpent god Quetzalcoatl has been turned into a series of condos. Located among the lush natural ravines of Naucalpan, Mexico, Quetzalcoatl’s Nest is a fantastical snake-shaped structure that includes ten separate apartments spread over 16,500 square feet. Designed by renowned Mexican architect Javier Senosiain, the residence is an exploration of ‘organic architecture’ that takes its design inspiration from nature and aims for minimal impact to the environment. Working on the irregular-shaped land, which is filled with caves and vast tracts of oak trees, proved challenging but inspirational for Senosiain, who looked at the natural shape of a cave mouth and saw an animal aspect. With this in mind, the architect built a magnificent 165 x 20 foot serpent’s head, the gaping maw of which is shaped from the site’s biggest cave. Despite the obvious addition of a massive snake house, the foliage and natural surroundings remain almost untouched by the complex. The only alterations made were considered necessary for safety and construction allowing Senosiain to stay true to his organic architecture ethic. The twisting walkways of Quetzalcoatl’s Nest provide some pretty spectacular views of the ravines and canyons so long as you don’t mind standing in the jaws of an Aztec snake god. Update: As of July 2019, this location can be accessed through overnight rental stays. There are events planned for the public throughout 2019, as the park plans to become fully accessible to the public in the coming years."
75,La Casa Azul,"Mexico City, Mexico","Frida Kahlo's childhood home, now a museum of her life and works.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-casa-azul,"From the outside, La Casa Azul is a simple structure in the Coyoacan district that would likely be overlooked if not for its striking shade of blue. But beyond the sky-colored concrete lies a world that once brought two of Mexico’s most famous artists into contact with Marxist revolutionary Leon Trotsky. Before Trotsky ever made his way to Mexico City, La Casa Azul was already a hotbed of intellectual activity, and was the childhood home of Frida Kahlo. It was in La Casa Azul - bedridden after a bus accident that left her in pain for the rest of her life - that she learned to paint,. After her painting began to take off, La Casa Azul really began to take shape. After marrying Diego Rivera, Kahlo and her husband became friends with Trotsky, who had begun a life of exile in Mexico. During his time in Mexico, Trotsky spent two years with his wife at La Casa Azul and even allegedly had an affair with Kahlo when her relationship with Rivera was on the rocks. Kahlo also died in the home and in 1958, her husband donated it to be turned into a museum dedicated to her life and works, the museum offers visitors an intimate look within the walls, some of which were actually modified by Rivera who studded them with volcanic rock and ceramics. Along with their artistic additions to the house and a pre-Columbian courtyard pyramid replete with some Aztec and Toltec artifacts, the museum also features a look at the husband and wife’s history, and showcases a famous inscription left behind by the tempestuous couple. It reads simply “Frida and Diego lived in this house – 1929-1954”   You can catch a car service to this location or even take the metro and walk to the destination from the central district. As you wander through the different rooms and gardens, mind the little details like the sentences that populate the patio or the documentary ‘Between Pain and Pleasure’ that is being projected in loop in one of the adjoining rooms."
76,Cafebrería El Péndulo,"Mexico City, Mexico","Part bookstore, part café, and part forest.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cafebreria-el-pendulo,"This amazing chain of Mexico City bookstores normally follow multi-story floorplans incorporating café and restaurant facilities. A healthy serving of eye candy in the form of wooden floors, balconies with curvy green handrails, and living plants that seem to protrude from the shelves are common to the seven locations spanning the entire city. These stores will stir up your imagination, or at least give you something to look at as you stir your coffee. Common items for sale include new titles or reprints of older books in both Spanish and English and music (CD and vinyl) sealed in plastic wrap. Designer items commonly with Mexican and literary themes—porcelain luchador-themed salt and pepper shakers, or plush toys of William Shakespeare for example—are abundant on the stores’ gift sections. Don’t expect to find old, rare books or to have to dig through dusty crates of trash and treasure in these chic establishments. Two of the locations are small, single-story cafebrerías in the shopping malls of Santa Fe and Perisur. The locations on neighboring Roma and Condesa neighborhoods both feature 2-story floorplans in former mansions built in the traditional art deco style. In the Central Zona Rosa location on Hamburgo street, the dining gets less formal over each floor—table dining on the ground floor, sofas and reading for the cafe on the first floor, and a bar on the second floor. Most of the pictures above are from the featured Polanco location on Alejandro Dumas street. The mid-south San Angel location in the Centro Cultural Helénico theatre also features fascinating architectural features over its wooden-paneled 3 floors, including a very tall palm tree that grows through the entire height of the building.  Every store has different opening times but the constant in which all will be open is between 9 a.m.-9 p.m. Changes to the restaurant/café menus usually occur throughout all locations but still tend to offer at least a few vegan and vegetarian options."

Your spouse left for another lover? Is your soul dirty and filled with bad energy? For just about anything that ails you, there’s a solution in the Sonora Market, the largest esoteric market in Mexico and a must-see for those interested in mysticism. Local vendors have an answer to any of life’s daily troubles in the form of a magic soap, a holy water spray, or a love potion that uses toloache, a plant with hallucinogenic properties. The span of products offered is immense, ranging from fruits and vegetables to bread or shampoo or caged animals from chickens to dogs and rabbits. You can buy just about anything. A large array of vernacular religions are represented in Sonora, from Voodoo to la Santa Muerte via Brujeria, the Mexican term for sorcery which comes with its own bizarre recipe. A number of these beliefs are practiced by people alongside their Catholic faith, a syncretic phenomenon with the most incredible imagery and rituals."
78,Cenote Xkeken,"Dzitnup, Mexico",These azure waters were thought to lead to the Mayan Underworld.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cenote-xkeken,"Before the rise of 21st century Mexican drug kingpins, and severed heads in the desert, the Mexican Underworld had a significantly different meaning. Instead of accessing the Underworld through a dirty backdoor in a cantina, pre-colonial Mayan tradition believed the gates to the beyond lay in cenotes. Just a few kilometers from Valladolid in the Yucatan Peninsula, the landscape is dotted with natural sinkholes, leading straight down into the earth. Unlike their unsightly name, the sinkholes are beautiful and filled with crystal clear, blue-green water. They are easily accessible and have become a tourist hot spot due to their proximity to spring break destinations like Cancun. Despite their obvious aesthetic attraction, the Cenotes in the region have a fascinating history, dating back to the Mayans who inhabited the Yucatan before colonialism. Since the Mayans believed the holes led to the afterlife, they would often drop important objects into the cenotes. Some legends also state they were used in human sacrifice, an oft-debated part of Mayan history. Since most cenotes in the region were explored and studied by archeologists in the early 20th century, you are unlikely to be swimming with the remains of a Mayan sacrifice. You are more likely to simply enjoy a relaxing dip among the stalactites and radiant beams of sunlight from the outside world.  Less than 5km from Valladolid"
79,Biblioteca Vasconcelos,"Mexico City, Mexico","A jaw-dropping ""megalibrary"" that turns book-browsing into a geometric adventure.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/city-of-books-at-biblioteca-vasconcelos,"The world is teeming with stunning libraries, but precious few manage to seamlessly cater to design, the people, and history in such an admirable manner as Mexico City’s Biblioteca Vasconcelos. Located in the Buenavista area in the north of Mexico City, the massive Biblioteca Vasconcelos was designed by Alberto Kalach and completed in 2007 after three consecutive years of building. Situated among lush gardens and covering an area of over 38,000 square meters, this temple of knowledge is generally referred to as a “megalibrary” both for its size and the undeniable sense of import conveyed by the structure itself. Transparent walls, stories of intentionally slightly mismatched floors, and intricate networks of balconies and paths between replicating stacks let visitors literally get lost in the worlds contained within the books themselves. This library resembles something from a short story by the Argentinian magical realist author Jorge Luis Borges. It seems like it would be easy to lose yourself in the Biblioteca Vasconcelos. Because just like the non-textual world, in a megalibrary the options are endless. Choose wisely.  Take Metrobus linea 1 to Buenavista Station"
80,Soumaya Museum,"Mexico City, Mexico","66,000 pieces of art, donated by one of the world's richest men.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/soumaya-museum,"Housing a whopping 66,000 pieces of predominantly Central American and European art, the Soumaya Museum was donated and constructed entirely by one of the world’s richest men, Carlos Slim Helú. Towering over a plaza in Northern Mexico City, the Soumaya Museum covers 170,000 square feet and glides elegantly six stories into the skyline. Opened in 2011, the shiny ethereal building cost $70 million to build, but resulted in a chic complex of galleries accessible through a narrow entrance in the building’s front. Quite fittingly, considering the magical appearance of the museum, it was Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Colombian novelist, author of One Hundred Years of Solitude, and founder of the magical realist literary movement,  who cut the ribbon during the opening ceremony. Although the museum was a donation from Carlos Slim, each part of its construction was an inside job. His son in law, Fernando Romero, designed the massive structure and the exterior is covered in 16,000 hexagonal aluminum tiles from an aluminum plant Carlos Slim owns. The entire structure coyly enriches Mexico City’s cultural landscape while padding the pockets of the museum’s benefactor. While the modern architecture of the Soumaya Museum has drawn praise for its ingenuity and partnership with Frank Gehry, many have also derided the building as an eyesore. One critic even went as far as to attack Carlos Slim, saying that money can buy everything, except taste. Worth an estimated $65 billion, it’s at least nice to see Carlos Slim give a little back to his country. A museum is certainly a better way to spend your billions than writing your name in the sand of your private island.  Admission is always free. Open daily 10:30 a.m. - 6:30 p.m. every day except Tuesday when the museum is closed. Please note that this location houses the Plaza Carso galleries only. There is another entire building of art that is a companion to the museum in Southern Mexico City in Plaza Loreto, where much of the art now on display at the Soumaya was previously housed."
81,Las Pozas,"Xilitla, Mexico",Extraordinary sculpture garden created by an eccentric English poet.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/las-pozas,"Located in Xilitla, a small town of about 10,000 people in the Huasteca region of southern San Luis Potosi state, Las Pozas is the creation of Edward James, an eccentric English poet and artist and patron of the Surrealist movement. Its origins date back to 1947 when James, living in semi-exile in Mexico at the time, acquired the coffee plantation near Xilitla. He began his life in the sheltered luxury of the English upper class, attending Eton and Oxford, and later becoming a great supporter and collector of Surrealist art, sponsoring both Dali and Magritte in the 1930s. His English home — Monkton House — is also a dedicated surrealist fantasy. His role as a patron of the arts put him in touch with luminaries of his time, including Dylan Thomas, Sigmund Freud, D. H. Lawrence, and Aldous Huxley. Huxley introduced James to Hollywood types, who in turn introduced him to spiritualist West Coast visionaries, who then introduced him to the wilds of Mexico. A great lover of plants and animals, he was immediately attracted to its jungles with their lush vegetation. James registered his new property in Mexico in the name of his friend and guide Plutarco Gastelum, who would later become the foreman and overseer of all construction that took place there. For the next ten years, James used Las Pozas as a home for orchids and exotic animals. After an unprecedented frost in 1962 destroyed many of his plants, James started building the extraordinary sculpture garden that sits on the site today. The design of Las Pozas was inspired both by James’ orchids and the vegetation of the Huastecan jungle, combined with architectural elements taken from the Surrealist movement he was so closely involved with. Construction on Las Pozas began in 1962, and carried on for the next 20 plus years until James’ death in 1984. Las Pozas means “the pools” in Spanish, named for the nine pools on the property created from waters that flow naturally through it. The gardens feature more than 30 structures, ranging from plant sculptures to winding staircases to nowhere, and cathedral-inspired screens — some ornately finished, others seemingly incomplete, although it is unclear if they were ever intended to be “finished.” Most of the construction was done by Plutaco Gastelum, James’ friend and co-designer, who was described in Smithsonian magazine as “part Yaqui Indian, part Spanish aristocrat and a swashbuckling former rancher, boxer, telegrapher and amateur architect.” Gastelum’s home is now the eclectic hotel known as Posada El Castillo, near Las Pozas. In the 1960s and 1970s, James dedicated more and more of his resources to his “Surrealist Xanadu,” as he referred to it, spending millions of dollars and employing hundreds of masons, artisans, and local craftsmen. By the times James died in 1984, he had built 36 Surrealist-inspired concrete sculptures spread out over more than 20 acres of a tropical jungle. Over time, Las Pozas became known to artists, writers, travelers, and photographers interested in James and Surrealism. After James died, the Gastelum family took over the running of Las Pozas.  You can fly into Tampico via Houston, Mexico City or Monterrey. There are several flights into Tampico daily. You can also fly into Queretaro or Leon and rent a car or car and driver in San Miguel de Allende and drive up to Xilitla."

The twin houses were designed by the famed painter and architect Juan O’Gorman, a friend of Rivera, and constructed in 1932. They combine a bold functionalist style with more traditional Mexican forms and touches, including the colors and rows of cacti (O’Gorman is considered the father of Mexican functionalism). The left house belonged to Diego. In his studio, it’s possible to see the painter’s “judas” collection, a collection of papier-mâché cartonería figures of humans, skeletons, and animals, all assembled in the studio where he first constructed them. A showcase with small archaeological pieces that he collected, his bedroom and an office. The right house belonged to Frida. The only thing that retains the original furniture is the bathroom. There the tub that appears in the painting “Lo que el agua me dio/What the water gave me” (1938) remains intact, where Frida painted a portrait of her feet from the bathtub. In this house, Frida painted the best of her work. The couple inhabited the houses in 1934. When Frida’s father died, she returned to Coyoacán in April 1941 until her death. On the contrary, Rivera lived here until his death in 1957.  The entrance also includes a visit to Juan O'Gorman's study house in the next house."
83,Pyramid of Kukulcan at Chich'en Itza,"Chichen Itza, Mexico",Every equinox this Maya pyramid puts on a spooky ancient light show.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pyramid-kukulcan-chichen-itza,"A two-and-a-half hour bus ride from Cancun takes you away from the thumping parties of spring break and into the once thriving ancient capital of the Yucatán Maya, Chich’en Itza. During the spring and autumn equinoxes, thousands of tourists and locals pack in around the pyramid to recreate the parties of a thousand years ago—sans the cutting out of hearts—and to watch the “descent of Kukulcan.” A carnival atmosphere fills the surrounding meadow with sounds of drums, traditional music, and cheering crowds. According to legend, twice a year when the day and night are in balance, this pyramid dedicated to Kukulcan (or Quetzalcoatl), the feathered serpent god, is visited by its namesake. On the equinox, Kukulcan returns to earth to commune with his worshipers, provide blessing for a full harvest and good health before entering the sacred water, bathing in it, and continuing through it on his way to the underworld. A handclap near the base of the pyramidal results in an unusual chirping echo, which is said to replicate the call of the sacred quetzal bird. All legends aside, crafty and mathematically brilliant architecture combined with the natural rotation of the Earth creates an amazing and somewhat eerie image of a giant snake crawling down the temple. For five hours an illusion of light and shadow creates seven triangles on the side of the staircase starting at the top and inching its way down until it connects the top platform with the giant stone head of the feathered serpent at the bottom. For 45 minutes this impressive shadow stays in its entirety before slowing descending the pyramid and disappearing along with the crowd that gathered to see it. The Pyramid of Kukulcan or Kukulkan (also known as El Castillo, a name given by the Spanish Conquistadors) is the centre of Chich’en Itza, it was built over a preexisting temple between 800 and 900 CE. It is the biggest pyramid in Chich’en Itza; at its base 53.3 meters wide on all four sides. It towers above the other monuments at 24 meters tall with a 6-meter temple on top of the highest platform. Before access to the throne room of the pyramid was restricted, you could climb to the top and, on a clear day, see the top of the grand pyramid at the nearby ruin site of Ek Balam. The Mesoamerican fascination with, and knowledge of, math and astronomy shines when examining the details of its architecture. Each of the four sides has 91 steps ascending it, 364 steps total, with the temple topping the pyramid considered an addition step totalling 365, each step representing a day in the calendar. Additionally, the pyramid’s nine stages, bisected by a staircase on each side, represent the eighteen months of the Maya Calendar year. The pyramid was built to be a physical representation of the Maya Calendar (the same calendar that predicts the end of the world in 2012), while its orientation, slightly North East, is believed to have been calculated in order to create the phenomenon know as the “Descent of Kukulcan”. This phenomenon is recreated nightly (artificially) during the Light and Sounds Show at 7 p.m. in winter and 8 p.m. in summer. Chich’en Itza is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The archaeological site features various structures that are grouped into major clusters. The most famous and visited cluster is the Great North Platform where besides the Kukulcan Pyramid one can find the Temple of the Jaguars and the Great Ball Court.  From Cancun it is very easy to get a tourist bus to Chichen Itza. Or drive west on Hwy 180. Ask your hotel for more specific directions due to constant change in Mexican roads and lack of detailed information available online. From Merida drive 74 miles East on Hwy 180."
84,Cenote Ik-Kil,"Xcalacoop, Mexico",A magical sinkhole on the Yucatán Peninsula is adorned with mini waterfalls and hanging vines.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cenote-ikkil,"Just down the road from the famous pyramids of Chichen Itza lies one of Mexico’s most stunning sinkholes, or “cenotes,” Ik-Kil. One of the most ethereal qualities of Ik-Kil is the light filtering in from above, illuminating the mini waterfalls, vegetation, and vines that wrap their way around the edges of the cenote and hang directly from overhead like a curtain. The sinkhole clocks in at a depth of over 130 feet, and archaeologists are said to have found bones and jewelry in the watery depths of what was once a sacred Mayan sacrificial site. Visitors to this magical place descend down 85 feet of winding stone steps. From there it’s either a short jump into the water, or a considerably taller dive off a platform if you feel like joining the daredevils in line. (After rinsing off in outdoor showers so as not to bring unwanted chemicals or debris into the water’s careful ecosystem.) The site boasts a restaurant and overnight accommodations, as well as lockers and life vests for swimmers. The water remains cool throughout the spring months, and black catfish can be spotted swimming about alongside visitors. Ik Kil’s most recent claim to fame is its title as a Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series venue in 2010, 2011, and 2014.  Life vests and lockers are not free, but cheap and worth it if you're passing through. There are limited spots along the cenote walls to hang onto, and unless you're an experienced swimmer you'll want to stay longer than you're able to tread water."
85,Santuario Nacional del Angel de la Santa Muerte,"Mexico City, Mexico",A church dedicated to the Mexican skeleton saint.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/santuario-nacional-del-angel-de-la-santa-muerte,"Located in the historical center of Mexico City, the Santa Muerte Sanctuary is one of the most important landmarks for those who worship “The Bony Lady.” Three times a week, believers gather in the modest Bravo Street church to attend ceremonies deviated from Catholic mass. La Santa Muerte is probably the most popular idol in Mexico after Santa Maria de Guadalupe, an attention condemned by the Vatican, who sees the reverence for the skeleton saint as blasphemous. Suspiciously seen for sometimes being associated with drug trades and criminality, the Santa Muerte is the idol of the destitute, the one who lost hope and is outcast by the Catholic Church. The church itself contains a large statue of La Santa Muerte alongside the main altar. In 2007, David Romo, the Bishop of the Chapel, replaced it on the actual altar with a dressed mannequin, the Angel de La Santa Muerte, to avoid a too-macabre association with criminal acts.

86,The Mummies at Museo de El Carmen,"Mexico City, Mexico",Twelve natural mummies are displayed in the crypt of this former monastery school.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mummies-at-museo-de-el-carmen-mexico-city-mexico,"This former monastery school and chapel were built between 1615 and 1628 by Carmelite friars. The building that used to house the monastery school now contains a collection of Colonial religious art. In the crypt below the school you can find 12 mummified bodies of former parishioners. The bodies were left in the crypt after the school secularized and was finally abandoned in 1861. Due to soil conditions the bodies dehydrated and naturally mummified. The mummies were discovered by members of the Liberation Army of the South looking for monastic treasures during the Revolution. The soldiers left the mummies in place, but left the crypt uncovered. Over the following years, the bodies were rediscovered by people secretly exploring the decrepit building and became famous among the locals. In 1929 the mummies were placed in their velvet-lined wood and glass caskets that are still in use today. In 2012, the crypt was fully restored and opened to the public.  Take the 3 Metro to Miguel Ángel de Quevedo. After seeing the mummies and museum, try taking a walk in the monastery gardens, which are beautifully planted."
87,Desierto de los Leones (Desert of the Lions),"Mexico City, Mexico",Explore the atmospheric ruins of an abandoned convent in the dense forests of Mexico's first national park.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/desert-of-the-lions-national-park-convent,"Contrary to what the name suggests, Desierto de los Leones, or Desert of the Lions, is neither a desert nor are there any lions. Rather, it is the name of both Mexico’s first national park and the abandoned convent that lies within its forests. The origin of the name instead reputedly comes from the forest’s remote location outside Mexico City, and because the Spanish settlers were surprised at the number of Puma they encountered in the area, which they called lions. Today, however, things have changed. The Puma has become extinct in the forests, and urban sprawl creeps ever closer. These woods were never settled by the Aztecs, who preferred to occupy the lakesides (though there is evidence that they and other earlier civilizations long used the area to hunt deer and other game animals.) It wasn’t until the arrival of the Spanish that people began to live in the area in any numbers. In 1606, the Catholic Carmelite order of barefoot monks chose to build their convent here due to its peaceful surroundings and distance from the city, which made it ideal for meditation and retreat. Life for the monks who occupied the building would have been simple but often harsh due to the vow of poverty, silence, and chastity they had taken. In addition to the vow of silence that prohibited the monks from communicating with each other, they also were required to walk barefoot, which must have been very unpleasant considering the terrain, dangers of rattlesnakes and scorpions, and often cold temperatures. The convent eventually was abandoned in 1810, partly due to the deterioration and collapse of the building as a result of the near-constant humidity from, as well as the war of independence against Spain reaching the outskirts of the forest. After being used as a military barracks, the area was declared a forest reserve in 1876 and became Mexico’s first national park. However, many contend that the monks never really went away, and the convent ruins are surrounded by urban legends about the supernatural. Over the years, many visitors have reported seeing the ghosts of barefooted and hooded monks and feeling the presence of a sinister and unseen entity watching them. Though the Puma are gone, plenty of wildlife is still found within the park,  such as coyotes, bobcats, white-tailed deer, raccoons, and foxes. These, however, are seldom to be seen by visitors and it is more likely that you will see reptiles and amphibians such as rattlesnakes, salamanders, and birds of prey like the red-tailed hawk, horned owl, and Harris hawk.  Getting to Desierto de los Leones is slightly difficult. The best and fastest option is to take a registered taxi or uber from San Angel, which will drop you off at the entrance. Make sure you talk to the driver and schedule to be picked up when you are finished at the park. Bring some warm clothes as it is almost always cold, misty, and humid due to the forest's microclimate. If you are hungry there are several very good and cheap places to eat and have a coffee at the entrance just outside of the convent. Be mindful of stepping on rattlesnakes while walking in the forest during the summer months, and do not risk eating any of the fungi found on the trails, many of which look like ""magic mushrooms"" but are actually toxic."
88,City Hall Station,"New York, New York","A beautiful and abandoned New York subway station from 1904, complete with chandelier.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/city-hall-station,"The first New York City subway was built and operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and opened on October 27, 1904, to the joy of New York elevated train and streetcar riders. The City Hall station on the IRT local track was lavished with fine architectural details, including glass tiles and large chandeliers. However, the Gustavino vaulted ceilings and skylights were lost on busy commuters, and the stop was one of the least-used in the system. It was the only station that did not have turnstiles installed by 1923, and the nearby Brooklyn Bridge stop was frequented by the express train and closer to connecting streetcars.  Because of the curved platform, cars with center doors could not be used at this station unless they had specially modified door controls which allowed just the end doors to be opened. In 1945, the station was closed when platforms along the line were being lengthened to accommodate longer trains, and the number of passengers using this station dwindled to very few. Another factor leading to the decline of the station’s use was the fact that a person boarding the train at City Hall with a station intended destination below City Hall or in Brooklyn would wind up on the uptown platform at the Brooklyn Bridge station. They would then have to go upstairs and down to the downtown platform to continue their journey. It was much easier to walk the short distance at street level to the Brooklyn Bridge station. Up until the late 1990’s the passengers on the Lexington Avenue Local (today’s 6 train) had to disembark from the train at the Brooklyn Bridge stop. That is no longer the case. The skylights have been reopened, and the station lights turned back on. While passengers can not get out of the train and experience the City Hall Station as they once might have, they can stay on the train as it loops around on those tracks and heads back north. The New York City Transit Museum hosts periodic tours of the abandoned station; however, you must be a member of the museum to attend. Check the website for details.  If you will be staying on the downtown 6 train after it leaves the Brooklyn Bridge station, it is best to be in the 7th, 8th or 9th car as the train operates very slowly around the curve in front of the City Hall station. Tour tickets are $50, and regular adult membership to the museum is $60."
89,The Wave Organ,"San Francisco, California",A huge musical instrument played by the ocean.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wave-organ,"Located on a jetty in the San Francisco Bay, the Wave Organ was built in 1986. In collaboration with the Exploratorium, artist Peter Richards built an acoustic sculpture that amplifies the sounds of the waves in the bay. The organ’s jetty was constructed with carved granite and marble from a demolished cemetery. Magnificently old and finely worked pieces form the irregular terraced seating and even a trash can holder. The instrument itself is comprised of more than 20 PVC and concrete pipes that extend down into the water at various elevations. The sound is created by waves crashing against the ends of these pipes. When the waves roll in, the pipes resound with liquid music: low, gurgling notes that ebb and flow with the restless movement of the ocean and the changing of the tides. What makes the music? It is similar to the phenomena of the sound heard in a conch shell—a specific volume of air resonating at a specific frequency. The same sort of thing happens in the pipes of the Wave Organ, but there is one important difference. In the Wave Organ, the columns of air within the pipes constantly change as the water moves in and out, and as the length and volume of the air column in each pipe changes, the pitch of the sound it produces also varies. The larger the volume of air, the lower the sound; the smaller the volume of air, the higher the sound.The park-like setting on the lee side of the breakwater has a view of San Francisco’s Marina District, downtown San Francisco’s skyline, the East Bay hills, Sausalito, Mt. Tamalpais, the Presidio, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the Marin Headlands. Fishermen are often at the organ in the morning, which after the walk by the marina can feel like a detached place of peace within the city.  The acoustics of the wave organ are only active when the tide is in, and the music is best heard around high tide. Parking is available in the marina a short distance away. (There is a private marina club that has better access, but parking is closed off to the public at that point.) The organ is not far from the Crissy Field recreational area, which, if you have time, is about a 1.8-mile walk along the trail."

91,Magowan's Infinite Mirror Maze,"San Francisco, California",A psychedelic labyrinth on the San Francisco bay.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/magowans-infinite-mirror-maze,"People stumble about the labyrinth, arms outstretched. Even so, they sometimes find themselves smacking headfirst into their own reflection. Shrieking and giggling when they reach someone else they ask, “are you real?” This maze is contained in a nondescript building on San Francisco’s Pier 39. It’s a disorienting dungeon of columns and mirrors, lit by blacklight and flashing neon and scored by rave music. Once you’ve managed to make it through the purveyors have been known to recommend trying it again, this time backwards. This trippy scene is standard fare at Magowan’s Infinite Mirror Maze for visitors of all ages, no drugs required (or recommended for that matter). Its founder calls it “one part art, one part science.” The trick is simple–you’ve probably seen it before at a carnival–but the effect is still enchanting. Update February 2018: It appears the maze is now back open for business, after closing briefly with no explanation.  Admission is $10."
92,Secret Tiled Staircase,"San Francisco, California",An artsy hidden staircase leads to breathtaking views of San Francisco.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/secret-tiled-staircase,"The 16th Avenue Staircase is 163 steps of mosaic tiles, a colorful staircase hidden in the quiet Sunset district of San Francisco. This neighborhood has few other tourist draws, but those who find the staircase will be rewarded with sweeping views of the city, and a beautiful garden design including succulents and native habitat plants for the Green Hairstreak butterfly.  The site is an important waypoint on San Francisco’s famous butterfly-bolstering Green Hairstreak Corridor. The project began in 2003 and was completed in 2005, with the help of artists and many neighborhood volunteers, and was inspired by the Selarón staircase in Rio de Janeiro, a brightly colored tiled staircase and popular tourist destination. All the mosaics are donated by the community. At the very top is the sun (the stairs ascend from “sea Level” to the sun—get it?). There’s also another garden at the bottom and one of the last crops of Franciscan formation at the top (it has its own biozone!). The artists for this stairway are Collette Crutcher and Aileen Barr."
93,Dream House,"New York, New York","La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela's ""Dream House"" will immerse you in an ever changing world of sound and light.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dream-house,"When walking down Church Street in Tribeca, keep an eye out for a black door with a cryptic white sign that reads THE DREAM HOUSE. Although this is not your typical dream house with a 4-door garage, it guarantees to be a one-of-a-kind experience, with its completely absorbing, constantly fluctuating sound waves accompanied by neon pink reflections of light. Created in 1993 by modern composer La Monte Young and visual artist Marian Zazeela (who are married to one another), this is the culmination of 40 years of their work. Zazeela explains that “together, the sound and light can be experienced as a new form or new media: the sound and light environment. The experience of the two mediums together as one requires a new, or at least different, mode of attention.” For example, unless you are completely still, be prepared to encounter a new collection of pitches with every move you make, as you encounter the various resonating sound fields created by Young. Young and Zazeela invite you to dive into their dream world, Wednesday through Saturday from 2PM-Midnight. Admission is $10.00– walk right in. Update August 2018: There is a restaurant at this address now. Dream House is on the third floor above the restaurant, denoted only by a paper sign. Removal of shoes as well as leaving behind bags and jackets is required. Silence inside the environment is requested. There is an AC, but it can be quite stuffy inside. Not handicap accessible."
94,The Last Bookstore,"Los Angeles, California",This iconic L.A. bookshop is housed in an abandoned bank—both symbolic and chic.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/last-bookstore,"More than a few bibliophiles would prefer that their prized possessions be kept in a bank vault as opposed to a bookshelf, but few actually get to see their dream in action. Enter The Last Bookstore, an iconic Los Angeles book shop with a not-so-subtly symbolic name that is housed in the grand atrium of what was once a bank. The marble pillars and mile-high ceiling remain from the old bank, but in place of patrons and guarded stacks of cash, bookshelves line the walls and artful displays of books abound. Not to imply that everything is brand new and sparkly. The bookstore actually specializes in reasonably priced used books, and takes great pride in offering a selection of well-kept vintage books as well. Anyone who’s ever loved a vintage book will know exactly what that means for the musty, decadent smell that hangs in the air in this seemingly sacred place. Almost as if to make a point about beauty in disarray, the bookshelves are placed every which way all throughout the store, and sculptures have been custom-built from overstocked or damaged copies. There are even hidden nooks, like the old bank vault itself, where books are winkingly displayed. There is a section of hardbacks arranged by color. Most of the fiction is purposefully unarranged, meant to inspire treasure hunts among shoppers. In short, every inch of the place is designed to make book lovers fall in love with it, and it succeeds."

Woken up in the morning and realized you’re fresh out of dinosaur eggs for breakfast? Discovered that your robot is out of milk…and has lost its toupee? Thankfully, The Echo Park Time Travel Mart has all the necessary supplies for your trip to the fourth dimension – and yes, that apparently includes robot toupees! Brought to you by 826, the same organization responsible for the Superhero Supply store in Brooklyn and the Pirate Supply Company in San Francisco, The Echo Park Time Travel Mart is a time travel-themed retail store that boasts the slogan, “Whenever you are, we’re already then.” The store sells humorous relics from the past, present and future, such as Barbarian Repellent, Michael Jordan pogs and varying Robot Emotions. The store is located in the historic Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California and like all other 826 shops, functions as both a retail space and literacy tutoring center.

96,The Wave,"Marble Canyon, Arizona",Rippling sand dunes frozen in the Arizona rock.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wave-rock,"190 million years ago, one of the greatest geological formations in the world began to take shape. In the Coyote Buttes ravine, some 5,225 feet above sea level, stands Arizona’s the Wave. The Wave has a remarkable undulating appearance, with massive sandstone structures stretched like taffy and cinnamon color strata domes. It is, in a way, a geological snapshot in time, a still shot of the effect natural forces have on the environment. The Wave is comprised of Navajo Sandstone dunes that have calcified vertically and horizontally, turning into hardened, compacted rocks over time. The peculiar and unique fluctuating stratum was created by slow wind and rain erosion. The Wave remained basically unknown until the 1990s when it was largely advertised in German travel brochures and shown in the 1996 movie Faszination Natur. Small groups of Europeans visited the area, and its popularity grew; tour guides confide that it is still largely a European population that visits, though Americans have definitely begun to take notice of the landscape. Many describe walking through the dunes as an intensely strange experience, surreal and vertigo inducing, or in several cases, described as being like a drug induced walking dream. The rock is certainly a photographer’s delight, where professionals and amateurs strive to take the perfect mid-day shot when not a single shadow eclipses the Wave, or they go for the more dramatic effect of morning or near-twilight that comes with the high domes casting stark shadows on the land. While the rocks have been hardened, they are still susceptible to damage. Only 20 visitors a day are allowed to walk through the ravine, and permits are required. The permits are issued through online and in person lotteries, and tour guides are available for hire.  When you obtain a permit, thorough directions are provided."
97,Roosevelt Island Smallpox Hospital Ruins,"New York, New York",A crumbling hospital from the 1850s on Roosevelt Island.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/roosevelt-island-smallpox-hospital-ruins,"Few diseases have had a greater impact on the history of human civilization than smallpox. The bubonic plague certainly wins for its baroque presentation. Malaria and HIV are concurrent with our times and thus feel more real. But smallpox takes the contamination cake. It has been around for more than 3,000 years in all parts of the world. Before the vaccine was discovered in 1796, more than 400,000 people a year died from smallpox in Europe alone. According to the World Health Organization, smallpox killed one in ten children in Sweden and France and one in seven in Russia. The disease killed Louis XV of France and other European monarchs. Queen Elizabeth I had the disease as a child and wore heavy make-up to conceal her pockmarks. In the French and Indian Wars, blankets containing smallpox were purposefully given to Delaware Amerindians, in an early instance of biological warfare. Through extensive worldwide vaccination efforts, the disease was eradicated in 1979 - the only disease to be completely eradicated through human intervention. By the end of the 1800s, efforts were made in Western Europe and the United States to eradicate the disease by universal vaccination. But before that time, many cities built hospitals specifically for treating smallpox sufferers. In New York City, the southern tip of Blackwell’s Island (now Roosevelt Island) provided ferry access but kept the infected patients far away from the population. Better known for Grace Church on Broadway and St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Madison Avenue, James Renwick Jr. designed the smallpox hospital in his Gothic Revival style. From 1856 until 1875, the hospital treated about 7,000 patients a year. In 1875, the building was converted into a nurses’ dormitory, and the city smallpox hospital was moved to North Brothers Island, in part because Blackwell’s Island had become more densely populated. By the 1950s, Renwick Hospital had become useless and was abandoned by the city, quickly falling into disrepair. However, in 1975, the Landmarks Preservation Commission took interest in the dilapidated structure and declared it, in its ruin, a city landmark. They reinforced the walls to prevent it from completely falling apart but have not renovated it or opened it for tours. Only some of the outer walls and the foundation remain today. It is behind a fence on the southern tip of Roosevelt Island.  Take the F to Roosevelt Island. Walk south along West Road to E Road. The hospital will be on your right. You can also take the tram from Manhattan, or the ferry from Astoria, Long Island City, or Wall Street."
98,The Winchester Mystery House,"San Jose, California",A peculiar mansion built by the troubled heir to the Winchester gun fortune.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/winchester-mystery-house,"In 1886 an eccentric woman named Sarah Winchester traveled from New Haven, Connecticut, to San Jose, California, to start a new life. She purchased a small eight-room farmhouse and started a small renovation project that would take 36 years and $5.5 million (in the money of the time), only stopping when she passed away in 1922. By the time she was done, the Winchester Mansion was a modern marvel with indoor plumbing, multiple elevators, a hot shower, and central heating. It had over 160 rooms and 40 bedrooms, 10,000 windows, and even 2 basements. Of course, that’s not all that’s unique about the house. Not all the 2,000 doors can be walked through—one leads to an 8-foot drop to a kitchen sink, another to a 15-foot drop into bushes in the garden below. Staircases lead straight to ceilings, expensive Tiffany stained-glass windows were installed in places where they would get no light, and there are more secret passages than Narnia. A particularly odd delight is a cabinet that, when opened, extends through 30 rooms of the house. No one is quite sure why Mrs. Winchester demanded constant changes to her very large house. Of course, there are stories. The most prevalent story is that Mrs. Winchester was being haunted by the spirits of those killed by the Winchester rifle, which her late husband’s company had invented. After her husband passed away, a psychic told her that to evade the spirits, she would have to move out west, buy a home, and build nonstop. Some theories say she believed that as soon as construction was complete, she would die, while other theories suggest she built the house like a maze in order to keep her paranormal tormentors at bay and lost in the many intricacies of the building. As the theory goes, to avoid them she would sleep in a different bedroom every night and take labyrinthine paths through her own home. A massive earthquake struck the Bay Area in 1906 and toppled the top three stories of the house, damaging the other four stories along with it. Some say Sarah Winchester took this as a sign from the spirits that she was too close to completion and ordered the unfinished front half of the house to be boarded up. Though it’s open now, signs of damage from the earthquake are still clearly visible. In response to the ongoing claims of ghostly encounters and other paranormal phenomena on the property, in the early 1990s the Winchester management had a parapsychologist and paranormal investigator named Christopher Chacon conduct a full-scale scientific assessment of the property. The month-long, round-the-clock investigation included interviewing over 300 people regarding their experiences on the property, and analyzed every aspect of the environment for any unusual phenomena. In 2018, a horror film was made about the infamous house and the spirits that live within.  A Mansion Tour ($20-39), Explore More Tour ($20-$39), and Garden Tour (free) are all available. (The Explore More tour is not available for children under nine.) There are also Flashlight Tours around Halloween and every Friday the 13th. The Winchester Antiques Products Museum and the Winchester Firearms Museum are also housed on site."
99,Eastern State Penitentiary,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","World's first ""penitentiary,"" meant to be humane, drove men insane.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eastern-state-penitentiary,"Thrust into the middle of urban Philadephia is what looks like a great castle, a massive and haunting building. However, these walls weren’t built to keep Crusaders and robbers out, but to keep them in. This castle is a prison. Until this edifice was constructed, prisons had generally been commercial ventures, filled with prostitutes, booze, corrupt officials, and little to no order. Starvation, cold, disease, and violence often put an end to prisoners before they were even sentenced. Opened in 1829, Eastern State was designed by the “Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons” as a new type of prison where order reigned and those housed within might have a chance to be penitent for their crimes. Eastern State was to be the world’s first “penitentiary.” Compared to other facilities, Eastern State was a technological marvel and, at a cost of $800,000, one of the most expensive building projects of its day. At a time when President Andrew Jackson was still using a chamber pot, prisoners in Eastern State had their own private toilets. Inmates were served three hearty meals a day (usually boneless beef, pork, or soup and unlimited potatoes) and had their own private exercise areas. The cells each had skylights so that the divine wisdom of God might shine down upon those inside. In essence, Eastern State was a paradise compared to other prisons of the time. But despite all its material comforts, this “paradise” drove men mad. Known as the “separate system,” part of what made Eastern State unique is that prisoners weren’t allowed to interact with other prisoners at all, in any way. They ate alone, they exercised alone, and they read the bible (the only book they were allowed) alone. They weren’t allowed to talk to each other or to the guards. On the rare occasions they were taken out of their cells, hoods were put over their heads. Guards even wore felt shoe covers so as to keep the prison as quiet as possible. Utter silence, utter solitude. It was meant to inspire penance; instead, it inspired insanity. When Charles Dickens visited the prison in 1842, he wrote, “The system here is rigid, strict, and hopeless solitary confinement. I believe it, in its effects, to be cruel and wrong. I hold this slow, and daily, tampering with the mysteries of the brain to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body.” Eventually, due to overcrowding and disapproval of the “separate system,” Eastern State changed into a more standard prison, known then as the “New York System,” in which inmates shared cells and were permitted to communicate. The prison remained in use for 142 years, from 1829 until 1971, and housed such criminal luminaries as Willie Sutton and Al Capone (Capone was allowed a comparatively lavish cell with furniture, oil paintings, and a radio). Left abandoned for many years, it was narrowly saved from destruction, and in 1994 Eastern State re-opened its massive doors to the public. Left in a state of magnificent decay, anyone who finds themselves in Philadelphia would be well advised to pay a visit - and to be penitent. The self-guided audio tour features interviews with former inmates and guards, and is narrated by actor and director Steve Buscemi. The penitentiary offers a number of special tours, including “prison uprisings,” Winter Adventure Tours, a Bastille Day celebration, and a Haunted Halloween tour.

100,Mütter Museum,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",America's most famous museum of medical oddities is home to the remains of Albert Einstein's brain.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mutter-museum,"Located inside the headquarters of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, the Mütter Museum has a wide range of wondrous and curious medical displays. These include the skeleton of the tallest known man ever to have lived in North America and the fused bones of Harry Eastlack, who died of Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, an extremely rare disorder in which the soft connective tissue of the body ossifies, painfully freezing the body in an immobile state. These and many other exhibitions are displayed in some of the same Victorian cabinets that the museum began with in 1858. Among the extensive collection is a set of brain slides curated not because of its defects, but because of its extraordinary brilliance. They look like strands of kelp, or shards of bark. But in fact, these slides contain slivers from the brain of the 20th century’s most famous scientist: Albert Einstein. Einstein probably wouldn’t have been pleased. He wanted to be cremated, and for the most part, he got his wish. (His ashes were scattered in a secret spot on the Delaware River.) However, the pathologist on duty the night Einstein died in Princeton, New Jersey, wanted to keep the great physicist’s brain away from the flames, so that others might one day study it for clues to his genius. The pathologist, Thomas Harvey, ended up embroiled in drama with Einstein’s family and executor, not to mention the hospital, but was eventually allowed to keep the brain as long as he used it only for scientific study (no tourist attractions allowed). At first, scientists who analyzed small sections of the gray matter saw nothing unusual, but by the 1980s, some began to find intriguing features in areas involved in visual, mathematical, and spatial processing. It turns out that Einstein’s Sylvian fissure (a prominent groove) was shorter than average, while his parietal lobes were slightly wider, and his left inferior parietal lobe richer in glial cells (which nourish neurons). Neuroscientists have theorized that this architecture may have allowed Einstein to think with the kind of “associative play” of images that he claimed was key to his discoveries. However, the typology of Einstein’s brain can never completely account for his brilliance, in part because we don’t know what came first: was Einstein a genius because his brain looked this way, or did it look this way because he was a genius? It’s hard to know, especially without a lot of other Einstein-quality brains available. Meanwhile, this brain—a victim of 1950s-era preservation techniques and Harvey’s many journeys around the country—is no longer in great shape for study. The Mütter’s forty-six microscope slides of the brain came from a Philadelphia neuropathologist named Lucy Rorke-Adams, who donated them to the museum in 2011. She received them from a colleague in the ’70s, who got them from Harvey himself. An octogenarian herself, Rorke-Adams said she wanted to find a safe place for the slides before she passed on. She chose well, and the slides are now one of the museum’s most prized possessions. Easy to miss, but worth poring over, is the collection of 2,000 objects removed from people’s throats, housed in attractive wooden pull out display drawers. These are from the Chevalier Jackson Foreign Body Collection, amassed by Chevalier Jackson, who is considered to be the greatest laryngologist of all time. Also of particular interest are the conjoined twin skeletons, delicately displayed in various jaunty positions; the plaster death cast of celebrated “Siamese Twins” Chang and Eng Bunker, who died within hours of each other; the “Soap Lady,” an exhumed corpse from the 1800s unusual for the waxy substance that formed around it during decomposition; and enough horrifyingly-detailed wax models and preserved human fetuses to last more than a lifetime.  Open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Minors are welcomed but must be accompanied by an adult. Photography is prohibited."
101,The Elevated Acre,"New York, New York",Amid the bustle and noise of the Financial District hides a secluded garden oasis above the city streets.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-elevated-acre-new-york-new-york,"One of the most delightful experiences in bustling Manhattan is finding a secluded oasis within it. In a city where space is at a premium, there remains hidden away a lush garden of solitude, known to only a very few. Remarkably, this pleasant, quiet meadow can be found in the jostling streets of the busy Financial District in Lower Manhattan. Or more specifically, above it! The Elevated Acre is precisely that: a one-acre meadow flanked by delightfully designed gardens and plantings elevated above the city streets. Its entrance is fairly anonymous, an escalator at 55 Water Street, set back from the sidewalk. Currently surrounded by construction, passersby will often overlook it. But if you venture up the escalators you will find the marvelous Elevated Acre. The secretive urban oasis features a lawn, an amphitheater, a summer beer garden, winding paths of Brazilian hardwood, spectacular views of the East River, Brooklyn, and the Brooklyn Bridge, and above all, pleasant solitude. This elevated one-acre park is one of Manhattan’s most relaxing secrets."
102,Antelope Canyon,"Page, Arizona",Most-visited and most-photographed slot canyon in the American Southwest.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/antelope-canyon,"Frequently subject to flash floods, Antelope Canyon can only be visited through guided tours because of the extreme danger. Still, it has managed to become the most photographed and most-visited slot canyon in all of the American Southwest due to its beauty and a peculiar phenomenon of natural light beams. Formed by millions of years of wind and water erosion, Antelope Canyon’s magnificent smooth and flowing shaped sandstone has made it one of the most famous slot canyons in the world. Located within the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation in Arizona, Antelope Canyon is actually two separate canyons, the upper canyon and lower canyon. The upper canyon, which the Navajo call Tsé bighánílíní (“the place where water runs through rocks”), is a narrow passage through 120-foot-high canyon walls. The lower canyon is known as Hazdistazí (“spiral rock arches”) and is a shallower V-shaped canyon that is a more difficult trek for visitors.   Both upper and lower canyons are only accessible by guided tour which are pretty expensive. Also, pets are not allowed anywhere in the park, including service animals! Tripods are not allowed, unless on a photography tour, which comes with a surcharge. To properly film the light beams, a sturdy tripod and a wide-angle lens are highly recommended."

This tiny space features rotating and permanent collections, specializing in the “overlooked, dismissed, or ignored.” Museumm offers a unique opportunity to engage with familiar and exotic everyday objects from around the world. Past exhibitions include Personal Possessions found in the Pacific, Paper Works found in Copying Machines, and Homemade Weapons of Defense. Created by filmmakers Alex Kalman, Benny and Josh Safdie, and sponsored by the late Kate Spade (and Andy and Bea Spade) of the purse empire, among the unusual objects featured in the museum have been the shoe thrown at George W. Bush at the Minister’s Palace in Baghdad, a hot water coil heater from Kaunas, Lithuania, and a plastic glove from Paradise Valley, Montana. The collection is refreshed annually. In 2018, a small “gift shop” was added in a window a few feet down on the right of the Mmuseumm. Visitors may call an 800 number to access a free audio guide. The museum fits three people at a time.  During the spring, summer, and fall, Mmuseumm is open on Saturdays and Sundays. Mmuseumm will resume public hours with the launch of Season 7 in Spring 2019. As always, Mmuseumm is visible 24/7 through viewing windows."
104,Lake Hillier,Australia,An Australian lake whose pink hue defies scientific explanation.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-hillier,"From a distance, Lake Hillier of Australia’s Recherche Archipelago looks like a swath of solid bubble-gum pink. Draw closer, and the color takes on a more watery, translucent quality, but remains unmistakably pink. Whereas the causes behind the unusual coloring of other pink lakes, such as the nearby Pink Lake and Senegal’s Lake Retba, have been definitively confirmed, the reason for Lake Hillier’s color remains a mystery. Theories abound, of course. Some speculate that Lake Hillier’s color, like that of the other lakes, is the result of high salinity combined with the presence of a salt-loving algae species known as Dunaliella salina and pink bacteria known as halobacteria. Unlike other pink lakes, however, which regularly change colors in accordance with temperature fluctuations, Lake Hillier maintains its pink shade year-round. The water even retains its rosy hue when bottled. Whatever the cause, the water does not appear to pose any danger to humans. Swimming in it is not possible anyway, since the island is used only for research purposes and tourists can admire it only from above on helicopter rides.  Helicopter flights operate daily during the October–April period. The rest of the year, you can book a private tour."
105,Glowworm Tunnel,"Helensburgh, Australia",An abandoned railroad tunnel is now filled with bioluminescent bugs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glow-worm-tunnel-helensburgh,"Drowned railroad tracks lead to an abandoned passageway nearly lost within a cascade of leafy greenery. Once inside, an enchanting blue glow illuminates the dark, dank tunnel. Officially called the Metropolitan Tunnel, this underground passage was built in the 1880s. Its use was short-lived, as it closed in 1915 after years of soot and smoke built up within the space and made it dangerous for the trains’ crews and passengers to pass through. One end of the tunnel became sealed shut so it could become a reservoir. The north entrance, too, became blocked from years of mucky debris building up outside. The whole tunnel was nearly hidden behind a thick veil of lush flora. Before it was drained and partially cleared in 1995, the entire passageway was full of stagnant water. But the tunnel wasn’t completely abandoned during this time. A colony of glowworms—one of the largest in all of New South Wales—moved in and made its home on the roof. The insects illuminate the stale, inky air like a constellation of blue-green stars. The tunnel still floods fairly frequently. On days where the water level is particularly high, people pass through the small waterfall that often tumbles across the entrance after heavy rains with pool floats or inflatable canoes in hand. They then paddle deep into the darkness until they reach the spots where the ceiling becomes brightest with the soft glow of the bioluminescent bugs."
106,Gippsland Lakes Bioluminescence,"Raymond Island, Australia",Australian Lake set aglow by Noctiluca Scintillans.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-gippsland,"The conditions were rare, and they were perfect. Starting with a series of bush fires in 2006, followed by torrential rains in 2007, by 2008 massive amounts of ash and nitrogen rich soul was washed into the Gippsland Lakes in Southeast Australia. While this would have normally resulted in a bloom of bacteria, because of the scale of the fires and the flood, that year something unusual happened. A massive algae bloom of Noctiluca Scintillans, visible as murky red patches during the day, appeared replacing the more usual normal green Synechococcus. But the Noctiluca Scintillans had another trick up its sleeve: at night it glowed. In the summer of 2008 and 2009, the shores of the Gippsland Lakes glowed a faint blue at night as the bacteria were agitated by movement in the water. Anyone taking a skinny dip at night would find the water glowing spectacularly around them. The lakes have since lessened in bioluminescence - a good thing as the bacteria blooms are harmful to other life in the lake - and it may be a very long time until a bioluminescent event of that scale happens again on the lake. However, those who are willing to head out for a midnight swim in Gippsland can still often catch a faint glowing about them during the summer months of the year."
107,Paronella Park,"Mena Creek, Australia",A castle hand built by a Spanish dreamer in the Australian tropical jungle.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paronella-park,"Technically, José Paronella was on his honeymoon with his wife Margarita, but his trip from Spain to Australia in 1925 was also the beginning of years of labor and the creation of a dream estate in a lush jungle. On five hectares (about 12 acres) in North Queensland, Paronella first planted thousands of trees to create the right environment for his vision. He then built the Grand Staircase to help him carry river sand up the hill to make concrete, with which he built first his house, then a grand castle inspired by those of Spain, and installed the oldest hydro-electric dam in North Queensland. Among the park’s features include the theater, foyer and refreshment rooms within the castle, a fountain built by Paronella, and the concrete benches he built next to a beautiful waterfall. After a decade of labor, the park opened in 1935. José Paronella continued to labor tirelessly on the park, fixing it after a bad flood in 1946, until his death in 1948. He had been laboring on the park for the last 21 years. Without his tireless energy, it became difficult to upkeep the park and over the years, the park was badly damaged by natural disasters; floods, fires and a cyclone decimated it. Though José’s children and grandchildren continued to own and care for the park for many years, by 1977 the park was sold. After a fire struck in 1979, and Cyclone Winifred in 1986, the park was closed for good. But, in 1993, the Park was purchased by Mark and Judy Evans and reopened to the public. The Evans see their role as that of maintaining and preserving the great work of art created by José Paronella. The park now operates tours throughout the day, as well as a spectacular evening tour. They recommend you spend at least three hours exploring both the natural and man-made wonders, from the grand staircase and castle to the waterfall and magnificent flowers. Paronella Park has won numerous tourism awards and was listed as a National Trust in 1997. Additionally, in 2008, they updated the hydro-electric system, which generates all the power for the park and puts power back into the grid for neighboring towns. To seal this Hollywood ending, Australian director Ben Hackworth plans to make a feature film of the history of the park. Admission to the park includes a night stay in their caravan park, annual admission, guided tours, and two maps. one hour drive south of Cairns"
108,Newnes Glow Worm Tunnel,"Putty, Australia","Once the path of a railway tunnel, now home to thousands of glowing insects.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/newnes-glow-worm-tunnel,"Sometimes, abandoned man-made structures turn into dangerous eyesores, rotting away slowly before returning to nature or being torn down. But other times, abandoned structures take on a new semi-natural life all their own, like a crab who uses a jar for a shell. Such is the case with the Newnes railroad tunnel. The Newnes railroad was closed in 1932 after 25 years of shipping oil shale. The rails were pulled out of the 600-meter tunnel, which had been bored through the sandstone in the Wollemi National Park, and the tunnel was left to its own devices. For Newnes, that meant becoming home to thousands and thousands of glow worms. The glow worm is a catch-all name for the bioluminescent larvae of various species, in this case, the Arachnocampa richardsae, a type of fungus gnat. Found in massive numbers in caves, the fungus gnat larvae cling to the rocky walls of the abandoned tunnel and hunt with long, glowing strings of sticky mucus. To see the glowing gnats, enter the tunnel during daylight hours, and head to the middle - it gets dark in the middle where there is a bend in the tunnel - with a flashlight, so as not to bump into the walls. Turn off the light and wait a minute or two. One by one, the gnats will begin to shine like stars emerging in the night. A similar cave can be found in New Zealand at the Waitomo Glow Worm Cave.  There are several ways to get to the Newnes Glow Worm tunnel: 22km walk each way: Walk for 22km along the route of the old railway line from Newnes 9km return walk: Drive to the weir over the Wolgan River 7km before Newnes. Walk up the nearby fire trail to the railway line to the right Walk or cycle in from Newnes State forest Drive from Lithgow or Clarence (both roads eventually join up), about 25km bumpy dirt road, and walk 1km to the tunnel."
109,William Ricketts Sanctuary,"Mount Dandenong, Australia",A collection of outdoor mystical statues paying homage to indigenous Australians and ecological stewardship.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/william-ricketts-sanctuary,"A mere hour from Melbourne, in the Dandenong Ranges, one finds a landscape of huge pine trees and beautiful fern gullies. In one of such gullies, a man’s life-work and dreams live on. Born in 1898, William Ricketts began developing his skill in clay modeling in his teen years. In the 1930s he purchased a four-acre plot of land on Mount Dandenong, naming it ‘Potter’s Sanctuary’. Beginning in 1934, William Ricketts started work on his clay figures that would soon adorn all of his property. In the 1960s, after having gained some local notoriety for his sculptures, the Victorian Government bought the sanctuary and some surrounding land to become a park for public use. He continued to live on and work in his Sanctuary until 1993 when he passed away. Between 1949 and 1960, Rickett traveled often into the desert interior of Central Australia. It was here that he spent time with both Arrente and Pitjantjatjara indigenous people. These native peoples not only inspired his work as models but influenced his philosophy as well. Rickett is known for his belief that all humans should be stewards of the land, just as the indigenous people he spent time with were. The goal of his life-long project was to provide a relaxing setting where one could reflect on man’s oft forgotten connection to nature. Nestled in a glade covered in fern and mountain ash trees, William Ricketts’ masterpiece feels alive. Some covered in moss, the 92 ceramic sculptures in the park all blend seamlessly into their natural surroundings. “Each one of us is a transformer of Divine Power and when love finds form in sculpture and music we are richly blessed because through such we can reach God… Man is nature’s masterpiece, therefore claim your inheritance by giving her the co-operation you owe.” -William Ricketts William Ricketts Sanctuary is about 40 km east of Melbourne. Take Canterbury Road to Montrose, then follow the Mt. Dandenong Touist Road for 4 km, or take the Burwood Highway to Fertree Gully, then follow the Mount Dandenong Tourist Road for about 12 km."
110,Redwood Forest Tree Art,"East Warburton, Australia",Woven tree art gives this towering Australian woodland a touch of mystical whimsy.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/redwood-forest-tree-art,"Thousands of California Redwood trees stand tall in an Australian forest, planted in neat rows far from their native homeland. Arranged like orderly guards, they tower over the earth, some reaching up to 180 feet high. Sunlight filters through their leaves, dappling the forest floor and illuminating the strange portals and enormous nests scattered about. Walking through the California Redwood Forest in East Warburton, Australia, is like entering a magical realm. You’ll come across bird nests so large they’d dwarf even dragon eggs and round circles woven from sticks that look like portals into another world. This tree art, built from twigs and branches, adds to the forest’s enchanted feel. It brings a touch of mystical whimsy to a woodland originally planted for practical purposes. The trees were planted in the 1930s as part of a revegetation program. Arranged in a grid formation, it was hoped they could help control the weeds that had begun to thrive in the previously cleared land. Later, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works used the woodland to study forest hydrology. Though their studies have since ended, the Redwood Forest still attracts its share of experiments, though these are more artistic in nature. It’s common to find the work of artist David Digapony scattered throughout the trees. His creations, which he makes by weaving together fallen branches, bring a bit of unexpected enchantment to the otherwise orderly forest. Follow the Warburton Highway east out of Warburton until it becomes Woods Point Road. Around four miles out of town you will find Cement Creek Road to the left side of the road. Travel a bit farther, the road is unsealed and a little rough in places but suitable for a car. You'll soon find a small parking area on the right hand side and a gate that leads to the forest, walking tracks, and the creek at the bottom of the hill."
111,SS Ayrfield,"Wentworth Point, Australia",Nature is leading a successful mutiny on this century-old freighter.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ss-ayerfield,"From cargo freighter to floating forest, the SS Ayrfield is a beautifully broken-down wreck, forever locked in Australia’s Homebush Bay. Once a center of industry, Homebush Bay was unfortunately contaminated with toxic waste and is now a commercial and residential suburb of Sydney after having been refurbished by the economic boom brought on by the 2000 Olympic games. However, the bay’s past as a successful trading port still lingers on in the form of four abandoned freighters slowly rusting in the waters. Once used to transport coal, oil, and war supplies, the ships were eventually decommissioned and simply left where they floated. The most remarkable of these wrecks is the SS Ayrfield, which has miraculously sprouted a lush forest of mangrove trees. The branches of the thriving trees spill from the sides of the ship, slowly breaking down the hull of the long-lived ship which was originally built in 1911. The trees have so completely overtaken the ship, it is a wonder that it still floats. The SS Ayrfield may have survived World War II, but nothing can combat the encroaching hand of nature.  The ship is within Homebush Bay, near the southwestern shore, along with some other wrecks. You can see it from land."
112,Wave Rock,"Hyden, Australia",This gracefully curving formation looks like a massive wave that was suddenly turned to stone.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wave-rock-2,"You might not be able to surf on it, but Australia’s lovely Wave Rock is one of the most stunning swells in the world. Made out of millennia of layers of stone, this natural formation looks as though it is actually petrified water. At almost 50 feet high and over 300 feet long, Wave Rock’s impressive size and shape have been drawing crowds for decades. It’s an example of what geologists call a “flared slope,” which forms at the base of an inselberg (an isolated rock hill or mountain that juts from a plain). There are several other examples of this throughout Australia, though none as impressive as Wave Rock. The amazing formation is actually just one side of an entire hill known as Hyden Rock, The “wave” is just one side of it. Along the top of the wave, a low stone wall has been built that looks too flimsy for protection and too ugly for decoration. In fact, it’s there to guide rainwater to the nearby Hyden Humps Dam. The wall was built in the 1920s in order to help bring water to people living in the arid area, and it continues to serve the same purpose today. The incredibly fluid undulations of the wave are not the only incredible geologic sites in the area either. After uncounted millennia of erosion and sedimentary activity, there are also locations such as the Hippo’s Yawn, which is a natural cave that looks, as it says on the label, like the wide maw of a giant hippopotamus. Besides being a tourist hot-spot with over 100,000 visitors per year, Wave Rock has been an important site for the local indigenous people for thousands of years."

Despite the clear demand for an easier pass up to the Three Sisters, the Giant Stairway was almost not to be. When the walkway was initially conceived, the cost of etching all those steps into the hillside was dismissed but just a few years later, a new Chief Ranger was hired who had a bit more vision. Realizing the potential revenue a grand new path would bring to the park new boss Jim McKay put forth the idea again, just two years later after the first proposal and it was approved. Unfortunately, the project only got a fourth of the way up the path when etching the grand staircase out of the rock was deemed too expensive and the whole construction was stopped. However, the tenacious ranger continued lobbying for the path and work was eventually recommenced, this time using metal stairs instead of using the ground itself. Today, the Giant Staircase is complete and leads up 800 stairs rising over 1,000 feet in elevation, to one of Australia’s most picturesque vistas, and just as McKay predicted, draws huge amounts of visitors each year."
114,Ball's Pyramid,Australia,This dramatic sea spire is home to the world's rarest insect and is part of the lost continent of Zealandia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/balls-pyramid,"The remnants of a massive volcano, Ball’s Pyramid juts 1,843 feet out of the Pacific Ocean. It’s one of the surviving above-ground remnants of the once-lost (and recently found) sunken continent of Zealandia. Ball’s Pyramid lies about 14 miles east of Lord Howe Island. It rises some 1,800 feet out of the water and measures about half a mile in length and 980 feet across, which makes it the tallest volcanic stack in the world. The formation is visible from Mount Gower Track on Lord Howe Island. Discovered in 1788 by Royal Navy Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball, hence the name, the rocky spire was thought to be largely devoid of animal life until 2001 when a group of scientists discovered there what may be the world’s rarest insect. The Lord Howe Island stick insect (Dryococelus australis) had not been seen alive in over 70 years. Known as “land lobsters” or “walking sausages,” the six-inch-long insects were once common on the neighboring Lord Howe Island, but were assumed to have been eaten to extinction by the black rats introduced to the island when a supply ship ran aground on its shores in 1918. In 2001, the scientists found a colony of the huge Lord Howe Island stick insects living under a single bush, a hundred feet up. Somehow a few of the wingless insects escaped and managed, by means still unknown, to traverse 14 miles of open ocean, land on Ball’s Pyramid, and survive there. Just 27 of the insects have been found on the spire. They are currently being bred in captivity."
115,Wendy's Secret Garden,"Sydney, Australia","Built over an abandoned train yard, this hidden gem is full of winding paths and offers gorgeous views of Sydney Harbour.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wendys-secret-garden,"After Wendy Whiteley’s husband died in 1992, she realized she needed an outlet for her grief. To distract herself from the pain, she began clearing garbage and weeds from a patch of land overlooking a railway yard. She’s spent the past 25 years transforming the patch of land into something incredibly beautiful: a secret, hidden garden. No one ever told her to stop. Fueled even further by the later grief of the loss of her only daughter, Wendy kept transforming the forgotten lot into what it is today. She doesn’t actually own the land, but in 2015, the New South Wales Government gave a 30-year lease to North Sydney Council that will allow the garden to continue evolving and thriving. The garden is a quiet alternative to the bustling, more touristy parts of Sydney Harbour. It’s a lush, green landscape, full of vivid greenery and a handful of whimsical sculptures. Pathways wind through the maze of flora, leading to various nooks and crannies. With dozens of secluded benches scattered throughout, and several small tables in strategically private places, this is a great place to come to write, eat, or meet with friends while feeling like you’re the only ones there. Not only is the garden itself gorgeous, it also offers several stunning plant-framed views of Sydney Harbour and the iconic Harbour Bridge. If you’re looking for a unique, beautiful, and peaceful spot to visit in North Sydney, this is your place. Just a few minutes past Luna Park, you’ll want to keep a close eye out for the entrance under the train tracks, as the garden entrance itself isn’t well marked (it is, after all, a secret garden!)."
116,Lake McKenzie / Boorangoora,"Fraser Island, Australia",The only pollutant in the clear blue water is sunscreen.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-mckenzie,"Located 100 meters above sea level, Lake McKenzie on Fraser Island is one of the most beautiful and well-known freshwater lakes in Australia. The lake is a “perched lake” meaning it exists well above the water table and is thus comprised of pure rainwater only. This unique environment, along with the high levels of acidity in the lake, makes the water unsuitable for nearly all forms of plant and fish life. Without natural waste from plant and animal life, the lake is extremely pure. Strangely enough, the lake is too pure to sustain natural life that would otherwise inhabit its waters. Along with the clean water, the sand around Lake McKenzie is pure silica, giving the beach a shimmering white color. The famous heart-shaped-tree adds to the already pretty landscape. Unfortunately, human introduced compounds, such as sunscreen, soaps, and lotions, which wash off bathers’ bodies is a growing concern and could degrade the pristine blue lake.

117,Whitehaven Beach,"Whitsundays, Australia","A small, but award-winning beach known for its literally spotless reputation.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/whitehaven-beach,"Located on Australia’s Whitsunday Island, Whitehaven Beach is seven kilometers of miraculous white sand that is perfect for equally pristine visitors. Unlike most beaches in the world, Whitehaven is made of 98% pure silica which gives the sand its snowy complexion in addition to some other unique traits. The silica sand is of a finer grain than regular beach sand which is comprised of irregular bits of minerals. This gives the white sand a softer, more velvety feel. In addition, since silica does not retain heat well, the sands do not heat up in the summer sun, making the immaculate beach the perfect place to relax and sunbathe. Even stranger is that the surrounding rocks do not contain silica, meaning the beach must have been deposited on the island over millions of years of tides carrying the silica grains. To keep the beach in its heavenly state, regulations have been put in place outlawing dogs and cigarettes which might mar the posh surroundings.  At the northern end of Whitehaven Beach, you’ll enter the Whitsunday Islands National Park, and it’s here you can take the 10-minute short track through the tropical rainforest which leads to this spectacular Hill Inlet Lookout."
118,Eaglehawk Neck Tessellated Pavement,"Eaglehawk Neck, Australia",This extraordinary geological oddity resembles human-made pavement.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eaglehawk-neck-tessellated-pavement,"The isthmus connecting the Tasman Peninsula to Tasmania is covered in a pattern of regular rectangular saltwater pools. Although these depressions look distinctly manmade, they are the result of a rare type of natural erosion. Occurring near sea coasts on flat rock which has broken into regular blocks, the effect is known as “tessellated pavement” for its resemblance to Roman mosaic floors (also called tessellated pavement). The pavement takes two forms. Depressions are known as pan formations, occurring when saltwater wears away the center portion of the stones into pools. The opposite effect is known as a loaf formation, when the edges of the stone are worn away leaving a rounded crown resembling rising bread. Tessellated pavement is extremely rare, found only in a few places on Earth. The geology is not related to the effect that created the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland and Fingal’s Cave in Scotland. Those features were formed as basaltic lava cooled and fractured; tessellated pavement occurs as sedimentary rock erodes. Eaglehawk Neck is also famous for its association with the prison colony at Port Arthur. In 1832, a military outpost was setup to watch for escaping prisoners, and dogs were positioned along the isthmus to raise a ruckus if they spotted an escapee. The motley army of dogs were described in 1840: “There were the black, the white, the brindle, the grey and the grisly, the rough and the smooth, the crop-eared and the lop-eared, the gaunt and the grim. Every four-footed, black-fanged individual among them would have taken first prize in his own class for ugliness and ferocity at any show.” Port Arthur closed in 1877 (it’s now open as a tourist attraction), but there is a monument to the dogs at Eaglehawk Neck. Along with the tessellated pavement, there are several other unusual geologic formations, including a natural arch and blowhole nearby.  The tessellated pavement is located at the northern end of Pirates Bay beach."

-James Cook, June 3, 1769 at Venus Point, Tahiti Getting to Tahiti from England in 1769 to observe the century’s second transit of Venus was no small undertaking, and James Cook and his companion astronomers took their obligation to observe and record the passage of the second planet as it partially eclipsed the sun very seriously. In fact, history and the English Navy had much grander plans for Cook and his crew to “search between Tahiti and New Zealand for a Continent or Land of great extent.” They did not return to England until July 11, 1771 Scientists and observers from several countries were dispatched to view and document the 1769 transit of Venus from stations around the world in an attempt to accurately measure the distance of the sun from the Earth. The transit of Venus is a rare occurrence, happening in patterns repeating every 243 years. There had been a transit in 1761, but another would not occur until 1874, so this was their generation’s last chance for observations. Tahiti had only recently been “discovered” by Englishman Samuel Wallis in 1767, and his visit was rapidly followed by glowing accounts by the French explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville, who described the island’s beauty and the native’s natural charms with considerable poetry. The English government saw it as an ideal location to launch an exploration of the the south seas, in search of the fabled southern continent, as yet undiscovered. Cook arrived on Tahiti in April 1769, and promptly established Fort Venus on the northeast end of Matavai Bay, which he determined ideal for his assigned astronomical observations. On June 3, 1769, the weather turned out to be favorable, and Cook and his companions dutifully recorded their observations. As it turns out, Cook’s observations were flawed - yet still remarkably accurate considering the available technology. Following the transit, Cook and his crew departed Tahiti for their epic circumnavigation of the southern hemisphere, becoming the second European visitors to New Zealand and the first to record a discovery of Australia. Today Point Venus is home to a picturesque Victorian-era lighthouse and a monument to the crew of the Bounty, who also landed at Venus Point. Currently, there are no monuments to Cook, or markers related to the fort or the 1679 astronomical observations. The most recent transits of Venus were in 2004, and on June 5, 2012. The next transit will be in 2117. The picture is not of Pt Venus, but Arue where I live."
123,Teti'aroa Atoll,French Polynesia,This beautiful eden was once the vacation home of Tahitian royals before Marlon Brando bought it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tetiaroa-atoll,"The stunning Teti’aroa Atoll off the coast of Tahiti has long been admired for its tropical beauty, but it didn’t really become famous until actor Marlon Brando bought the whole damn thing as a personal vacation spot. Consisting of around 12 little islets covered in sandy beaches and tropical greenery, the atoll was once used as a vacation spot for the Pōmare royal family of Tahiti. They would use the island for rest and relaxation, and even sometimes, to hide treasure. Eventually the islets were given over to the only dentist in Tahiti, who passed the lands down among his family. Brando stumbled upon the islands while scouting a movie location, and decided that it would be his. He purchased the atoll from the dentist’s descendants and made it his own personal get away. He spent as much time there as he could afford, even if the Tahitian people weren’t exactly ecstatic about his Hollywood takeover of their islands. Brando even built a small hotel on one of the larger islands. Today there are plans to build an even larger resort complex on the atoll, called The Brando. But it is not all luxury vacations. At least one researcher is using the islands, introducing sterile mosquitoes as a preventative abatement procedure. Maybe in a few years, Teti’aroa Atoll will be known more for curing disease than for curing Brando’s boredom."
