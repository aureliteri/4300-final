0,"Hell, Grand Cayman","West Bay, Cayman Islands",Send a postcard while vacationing with Satan.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hell,"Hell can be very hot, especially in the summer. Most people picture flames engulfing most of the underworld, when in fact, Hell is mostly covered in black limestone, tourists, and excessive kitsch. Poking out from its lush surroundings on Grand Cayman is a small patch no bigger than a soccer field of rough, black limestone formations referred to as Hell. Hell was created by salt and lime deposits over 24 million years, and the legend of its name’s origin is controversial. Some say locals believed the place was similar to Hell’s landscape. Others assert that a British general hunting in the area exclaimed “Oh hell,” when he missed a shot near the area. Whatever the history behind the name, the area has attracted huge numbers of visitors and fostered a blooming tourism industry. Men dressed as the devil roam the gift shop and Club Inferno serves as the location’s top watering hole. There is even a post office where you can send friends and relatives postcards from Hell. According to Wikipedia, “Hell can be quite busy as it is a stop for cruise ship tours.” Those planning a visit from nearby George Town should schedule their trip accordingly. There’s only so much room in Hell for hordes of tourists. 20 minute drive from George Town",martian landscapes geological oddities ecosystems geology
1,Bloody Bay Coral Wall,"Little Cayman, Cayman Islands",A glowing underwater cliff attracts marine life and divers in equal measure.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bloody-bay-coral-wall,"Little Cayman has a population of less than 170, and nearly everyone who lives there is associated with diving in one way or another and even among these connoisseurs Bloody Bay is the island’s most wondrous dive. Supposedly named for numerous pirate battles, the bay is best known for the incredible underwater drop not far from shore: a nearly vertical wall of coral 300 meters down. While this impressive expanse would be enough to attract divers from around the world, the coral here doubles down on the natural wonder with its natural bioluminescence. This coral is home to numerous bioluminescent creatures, most of which are microscopic. While many organisms use bioluminescence to distract prey or predators or to indicate willingness to mate, no one is really sure what the symbiotic benefit is for the coral. In addition to the near invisible organisms residing in the coral, the living rock also fluoresces. Fluorescence is often confused with bioluminescence, but while bioluminescence is light created by an organism, fluorescence requires an external source of light (like sunlight or blacklight).  Most coral are capable of one and Bloody Bay does both, making it one of the most colorful and otherworldly dives in the world. Diving is easy and popular here on Little Cayman and a night dive is easily arranged, but you’ll need sophisticated equipment to capture the full range of colors on display. However if you aren’t afraid of the dark, Bloody Bay may be one of the most impressive sights in the natural world.",bioluminescence coral reefs underwater nature
2,Wreck of the Ten Sail,"Gun Bay, Cayman Islands",A massive maritime collision may have led to the myth of a resort island's strange financial status.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wreck-of-the-ten-sail,"At the East End of Grand Cayman, far from the island’s cruise ship terminal and financial centers, a simple memorial commemorates a maritime disaster that gave rise to a legend about the island’s tax free status. On the evening of February 7, 1794, a convoy of ten British ships en route from Jamaica met disaster on the treacherous reefs of Grand Cayman. The Royal Navy frigate HMS Convert led a group of nine merchant ships, six of which were bound for England, three for the United States. The Convert’s captain, John Lawford, went to bed on that evening believing he had already safely passed by Grand Cayman. Unbeknownst to Captain Lawford, during the night six ships in his convoy sailed ahead of the Convert on a course which sent them directly towards the Cayman reefs. At 3:00 AM, one of the ships fired a distress signal and Lawford returned to the deck to discover that his own ship was now bearing down on the reef as well. As Lawford attempted to change course another ship in the convoy collided with the Convert driving both vessels onto the reef where they quickly foundered. All ten ships in the convoy ultimately wrecked on the reef. As the passengers and crew struggled to survive amid the breaking waves, island residents from the East End and Boddentown, having heard the ships’ distress signals, paddled out to the reefs in canoes to attempt a rescue. In the darkness and pounding surf, the Caymanians saved 450 of the stranded souls. Amazingly, only six people lost their lives in the disaster. The heroism of the Caymanians in rescuing the English sailors and passengers fueled a legend that lingers to this day.  The story goes that one of the passengers rescued from the wrecked ships was a son of King George III. When the King learned of the island residents’ bravery, he decided to reward them by decreeing that the Cayman Islands would forever be free of taxation and war conscription. However, there is no record that any member of the royal family was on one of the ships or that the King ever issued such a decree. Yet the legend is commonly repeated to explain the island’s unique financial status. In 1994, on the 200th anniversary of the disaster, Queen Elizabeth II visited the island’s East End and dedicated a memorial to the six victims. On a cliff with a view looking out to the reef where the ships wrecked, a stone monument and plaque commemorate the event. Perched along the cliff adjacent to the monument are six small concrete blocks representing the unfortunate few souls the Caymanians were unable to rescue.",shipwrecks plaques islands memorials

Donald Crowhurst built the Teignmouth Electron for a round-the-world yacht race. Yet when the ship was found drifting in the Atlantic in 1969, Crowhurst was nowhere to be found. Based on the increasingly bizarre log entries found on the ship, it’s believed that due to sailing troubles he left the race and started reporting false positions, and eventually jumped overboard to drown. The ship then had several different owners, until it was left to decay in the Cayman Islands. Near the Kidco Dock, on the beach",ghost ships shipwrecks abandoned
4,George Town,"George Town, Cayman Islands","The capital of the Cayman Islands is a center of offshore banking, but gets battered by blistering hurricanes.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/george-town,"At first glance, George Town has it all. Stunning beaches, incredible snorkeling, and a thriving nightlife–throw in a few bank privacy laws and no direct income tax and voila! The fifth largest financial hub in the world and hot spot for the famous and wealthy. Alas, all is not well in paradise. The renowned tax haven also happens to be a nucleus of destructive hurricane activity. The small, flat island that hosts about two million tourists a year is extremely susceptible to heavy winds and rising sea levels. This factoid becomes particularly consequential in the face of devastating hurricanes that hit the island on average, every 2.2 years. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan submerged over 25% of Grand Cayman. Researchers estimate that over 80% of the island’s buildings were damaged in the hurricane. George Town’s incredibly resilient financial sector reopened with power only days after the hurricane struck. Impressive as it was, the recovery was criticized by many of the island’s less fortunate inhabitants who were left in the dark. However, the situation isn’t entirely obvious–Grand Cayman has more registered businesses than it has citizens. It seems the government was just serving the larger constituency.",weird weather phenomena disaster areas intriguing environs shops ecosystems
5,Davinoff's Concrete Sculpture Garden,"Old Man Bay, Cayman Islands",Grand Cayman is home to a colorful sculpture garden filled with giant concrete animals.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/davinoffs-concrete-sculpture-garden,"For those on Grand Cayman looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the island’s west side, a visit to Old Man Bay will bring solitude, quite and… concrete. Located snuggly between the main island’s North Side and East End, the private residence and concrete sculpture garden of David Quasis, aka Davinoff, seemingly appears out of nowhere. Drive too fast on the rural neighborhood road and you might miss it. Davinoff’s Concrete Sculpture Garden is home to a larger-than-life Blue Iguana (a species unique to the island), a giant crab and an octopus, among others. Most of the sculptures depict animals from around Grand Cayman, a place that Davinoff vacations in for part of the year. Quasis began the park in 1999 with the smaller sculptures and then gradually introduced larger sculptures to the park. On average, it took him about seven weeks to construct some of the larger all-concrete sculptures. Made on one concrete slab, the sculptures are coated in a mix of cement/sand mortar and weigh an average of 1,000 to 2,000 pounds.  Although the sculpture garden is located on private property, it is open to the public. The sculpture garden is right along the roadside and admission is free. Though visitors are welcome and encouraged, please obey the signs and park in designated areas.",sculpture gardens sculptures
6,Temple Beth Shalom,Cayman Islands,"This tiny, charming synagogue in the Cayman Islands was built by a man as a present for his Jewish wife.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/temple-beth-shalom,"You might not expect to find a synagogue in the Cayman Islands, where the population is almost exclusively Protestant. Yet nestled amidst the lovely gardens behind the Mango Manor inn is one of the smallest and most charming Jewish temples around. The Jewish population of Cayman Brac is comprised of just a few members, including the couple who built this synagogue with their own hands. Lynne met George Walton in college. She was an Ashkenazi Jew from Brooklyn and he was a “Bracker,” a native of Cayman Brac, descended from one of the early families with Sephardic roots. The two married and traveled the world. After George retired from 20 years of Air Force service, the couple returned to Cayman Brac and opened a bed and breakfast. The Caymans are very Christian and there was no place for Jewish worship on Cayman Brac. George wanted his wife to have a spiritual home, so in 2002 he built her a synagogue in the garden. Temple Beth Shalom is humble, but not shabby in the slightest. The round white building stands out against the blue Caribbean sky. George laid pearl granite floors and Italian marble beams. Lynne carved the heavy mahogany doors, which read, “HOUSE OF WELCOME, MAY ALL WHO ENTER HERE FIND PEACE.” The domed ceiling is painted like a starry sky, with 12 lanterns representing the 12 tribes of Israel. Over the years the couple has collected important Jewish artifacts, including a Byzantine oil lamp given to them by the British Commonwealth Jewish Council for their work in promoting Judaism in the Caymans. Services are held most every Friday, with Lynne often acting as lay rabbi unless someone more learned is present. Even if there are visiting rabbis and cantors, she still plays a mean shofar and delights in giving tours of the synagogue her husband built for her. Temple Beth Shalom has also become a sort of community and events center, hosting island weddings as well as orchestral concerts, AA meetings, etc. The tiny synagogue has established Cayman Brac as a popular destination for vacationing Jews, but as the door’s inscription suggests, people of all faiths are welcome.",jews synagogues judaism jewish temples religion sacred spaces
7,Ugland House,"George Town, Cayman Islands",There is one corporation registered for every three square feet of space in this inconspicuous office building.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ugland-house,"In 2015, American multinational corporations held an estimated $2.5 trillion in overseas tax havens, more than the GDP of the entire country of France. These tax havens are scattered across the globe, and one of the largest is inconspicuously situated in a five-story office building in the city of George Town in the Cayman Islands. There are nearly 100,000 corporate entities worldwide that use the Cayman Islands’ 0% tax rate to dodge corporate taxes, a number higher than the territory’s population itself. These thousands of corporations could together form a miniature city or a major financial district, but in fact thousands of their offices have the exact same address. The Ugland House in George Town covers a mere 10,000 square feet of land, but is simultaneously the official home of a whopping 18,857 corporate entities. Spanning just five stories, there is one corporation registered for every three square feet of space in the Ugland House. As President Barack Obama has remarked, “either this is the largest building in the world or the largest tax scam in the world.”",taxes wealth law money
8,Fusterlandia,"Havana, Cuba",A Cuban artist reclaimed his impoverished neighborhood as a dreamy folk art kingdom.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fusterlandia,"Cuban artist José Fuster’s art is “naïve,” meaning he uses childlike crude shapes and bright colors in his untrained composition. His work has been compared to that of Picasso, a comparison that followed him in successful gallery tours across Europe. After one such tour, Fuster was struck with a desire to recreate something like Gaudi’s public works in Barcelona and Brâncuși’s across Romania in his own homeland. He wanted to put his artistic reality into his real-world surroundings, and he began in his own neighborhood. In 1975, after moving into a modest wood house in the rundown neighborhood of Jaimanitas outside Havana, Fuster set about decorating his studio in colorful mosaic. Once he was done there, he asked his neighbors if he could decorate their homes and business as well. A few accepted his offer and the tile creations grew. Over the course of a decade, doctors’ offices, bus stops, fountains, benches, gateways, and more were enveloped by Fuster’s whimsical imagination. Today, his artwork coats the neighborhood in a rainbow of strange, enchanting fantasy. Jaimanitas was an economically depressed area before Fuster arrived, and now it has turned into an artist’s paradise. Tourists are bussed into the neighborhood to admire Fuster’s still-growing kingdom, which has spawned a new generation of artists inspired by the surroundings they came up in.  Taxi from downtown Havana (about CUC$20 unless you are a better negotiator than me), or regular local bus (MN$0.80, or about 1/500th of the taxi fare, if you are adventurous enough) - it just off Avenida 5ta and even the bus-stops are Gaudi-esque. I think one of the hop-on-hop-off tour buses goes to the area too, and some regular tours of Havana go there. It is in the Jaimanitas area, not at the spot marked on the map as Playa Jaimanitas, but a few blocks south towards the main road (you might have to scroll the map a little to see it). There is no charge, but Fuster and his neighbors (many of whom have become artists as a result of his work) will surely appreciate you buying any of their works, small or large.",public works mosaics outsider architecture outsider art art
9,Discoteca Ayala,"Trinidad, Cuba",This subterranean disco dance club in a Cuban cave comes with bright lights and a dark legend.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/discoteca-ayala,"In the colonial city of Trinidad, Cuba, the nightlife is underground. As in, 100 feet under the earth, in an actual cave. Disco Ayala, also known La Cueva, is a dance club built into a natural cave, an unlikely union of Top 40 dance hits and naturally formed stalactites. It also was once the home of an infamous serial killer. La Cueva (“The Cave”) is a favorite weekend spot for locals and the venturesome tourists that get wind of it by word of mouth. The cavernous disco is located on the northern outskirts of town, about a 10-minute walk up a hill away from the center of Trinidad, an old Spanish colony that feels even more preserved in time than the rest of Cuba. Two hundred miles from the bustle of Havana, horses still trot down the narrow cobblestone streets of sleepy Trinidad, a Caribbean coastal town founded by Spanish explorers in the 1500s that rose to prominence as Cuba’s sugar economy boomed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The historic town is an unlikely setting for one of the world’s most bizarre discos. As you approach La Cueva, the first curious thing you’ll notice is there’s no noise at all coming from the club. It’s not until you walk through the gated entrance, descend down a long flight of stairs and through a tunnel into the jagged cavity that the dance floor opens up and the music starts blaring. The second thing you’ll notice is that it’s very hot. You’re in the Caribbean after all, dancing in a throng of a thousand people. In a cave. Inside, the scene is marvelously unique, if somewhat tacky. A mix of techno and salsa music explodes from the speakers, while videos of spring breakers and Cuban dancers play on suspended screens above the crowded floor. Stalactites and stalagmites surround the room, illuminated by colored lights. Rumor has it the staff has to smoke out the bats from the cave before the club opens at 10 pm each night. A few CUC will get you admission plus a free drink from the bar, a hole carved out of the natural stone. This is Cuba; make it a mojito. As if cave-dwelling bats and disco lights isn’t a strange enough juxtaposition, the cave was also once home to a notorious serial killer: Carlos “Coco” Ayala, who legend has it would abduct children and murder them in this very cave. According to the oral histories, Ayala was a deserter from the Cuban War of Independence in the late 1800s, and went into hiding underground where he committed unspeakable crimes. As myth and truth have blurred over the years, the killer has become a popular figure in Cuban culture—generations of parents have warned their children to be good or else Carlos Ayala will get you.  Meanwhile, the decision to name the club after the cave’s murderous former inhabitant remains a mystery.  From Trinidad center, walk up a path leading directly behind the cathedral, off Juan Manuel Márquez, or take the longer route from Hotel Las Cuevas.

10,Colón Cemetery,"Havana, Cuba","In terms of history and architecture, this is one of the most remarkable cemeteries in the world.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/colon-cemetery,"When you think of world-class cemeteries, places like Paris, London, New Orleans, or Buenos Aires might come to mind. But this cemetery in the heart of Havana is as stately and impressive as any of the more familiar “haunts” (sorry). Established in 1876, the Cementerio de Cristóbal Colón was named after Christopher Columbus and designed by a Madrid-educated Galician architect by the name of Calixto Arellano de Loira y Cardoso. Built around a central chapel that was loosely modeled after the Florence Cathedral (aka “Il Duomo”), the 150-acre cemetery is laid out in a grid of main central avenues and smaller side streets. As planned by Loira, the layout organizes the occupants of the cemetery according to their rank and social status, with the wealthy and well-connected occupying prominent spots on main thoroughfares while more lowly individuals (such as the condemned, victims of epidemics, and “pagans”) are relegated to the “suburbs.” Colón Cemetery contains over 500 major mausoleums, chapels, and family vaults, with styles running from renaissance to neoclassical to art deco. In addition to the countless stunning examples of funerary architecture, unique sites include: an elaborate 75-foot-tall memorial for firefighters who died in a disastrous citywide fire in 1890; mausolea for various trade and professional organizations (such as the Workers Society of La Tropical Brewery); special monuments dedicated to two baseball players, a chess champion (shaped like a white king piece), and a dedicated domino player (shaped like a double-three domino); and the burial sites of a remarkable number of poets, filmmakers and musicians, including Ibrahim Ferrer Planas of the original Buena Vista Social Club. One can also find here and there abandoned and unmaintained tombs and chapels of families now living in exile. The very first occupant of Colón Cemetery was the architect Loira himself, who died before the project was finished. Currently, the cemetery holds over 800,000 graves and included a million interments. This of course means that space for this still-operational cemetery is a premium, so typically remains are removed after three years to be boxed up and put in storage (yes, you read that correctly) in order to make room for new interments.",funeral art mausoleums tombs graveyards cemeteries
11,Callejon de Hamel,"Havana, Cuba",A colorful narrow alley in Cuba is full of street art and sculptures made of found objects.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/callejon-de-hamel,"Callejon de Hamel is a narrow alley in Havana filled with lively colorful murals and sculptures made from bathtubs, hand pumps, and pinwheels. It offers visitors to Cuba’s capital a taste of the city’s local art. Cuban artist Salvador Gonzáles Escalona describes his Afro-Cuban style as a mix of surrealism, cubism, and abstract art. After spending more than two decades producing artworks in Cuba, as well as the U.S., Norway, Italy, and Venezuela, the self-taught artist began adorning the alley outside his apartment with art in 1990. After filling the alley, which stretches for about two blocks, with mosaics, paintings, and sculptures, including a throne that bestows good luck and a bench made of old bathtubs, his works started spilling out onto street and up the sides of the buildings. The area was once rather desolate, but the colorful street now provides an eccentric backdrop for musicians and rumba dancers who entertain the increasing crowds of tourists and locals. Sunday afternoon rumba sessions are popular with tourists. A local children’s art program meets in the alley. The surrounding Cayo Hueso neighborhood once had a dangerous reputation, but Salvador’s art has helped to change perceptions of the area. Map the alley before you go because internet access in Cuba is iffy.

12,Coppelia,"Havana, Cuba","Castro's communist ice cream mothership has been serving five-scoop ""salads"" for over 50 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/coppelia,"In Cuba, you don’t have to look far to find an ice cream joint. But the aging citadel of cold confections known as Coppelia is the Alpha and Omega of the Cuban ice cream craze. Commissioned by Fidel Castro in an effort to bring the tasty phenomenon to his people, the sprawling, retro-modern helado complex has seen better days, but it continues to serve up thousands of scoops every day. Located in Havana, Coppelia was originally built in 1966 at the behest of Castro himself, who was notoriously interested in dairy products and sought to produce more quality flavors of ice cream than America. In truly grandiose fashion, the ice cream compound was erected on the site of an old hospital in the bustling Vedado district and designed to look like a sort of UFO, with long concrete spokes radiating from the top of the structure, surrounded by a park and assorted seating covering an entire city block. Coppelia was named after a 19th century comedy ballet by Celia Sánchez, Castro’s secretary and close confidant, who took charge of the project. Never has a communist dream of eating ice cream in the bowels of a stylized spaceship been more fully realized. In the early days, Coppelia offered 26 different flavors including such heady delights as orange-pineapple, coconut with almonds, and muscatel. Flavors were often mixed and matched in multi-scoop sundaes their eager customers couldn’t get enough of. Coppelia continued to grow and other locations opened around the country, but the central mothership never lost its iconic appeal. Over the years, the political tides have altered Coppelia’s offerings in different ways, as the price and availability of ingredients wax and wane, but through it all, the site has survived, becoming a “people’s park.” In the 1990s when trade fluctuations meant the country had to decide between dairy resources for butter or ice cream, ice cream won out. Coppelia still serves thousands of scoops each day to the hordes of people lined up for an “ensalada” (five scoops in a bowl), many of whom order more than one. According to some modern accounts, the number of flavors on offer are usually around three (of varying quality), down from the 50 or so offered during the shop’s heyday. Yet that hasn’t slowed Coppelia’s popularity. For all of the political, social, and economic influences on Coppelia’s significance, the simple truth is: Cuba’s hot, and ice cream’s not.",food markets and stores communism ice cream politics food

Built in the late 1800s by the Herrera family, owners of La Tropical brewery, this Cuban pleasure garden is now a somewhat abandoned gem on the outskirts of Havana. Meant to mirror a lush Spanish estate, the Tropical Gardens, as the site is known in English, was built around 1912 and quickly became a hot spot for high society and the most popular orchestras of the time. In its prime, the grounds were scattered with waterfalls, gazeboes, and a small palace in the style of the Alhambra in Granada. There was also a huge ballroom capable of entertaining around 500 amorous couples. As the popularity of the lush social space waned, the structures fell into disrepair and many of the extravagant flourishes throughout the garden became overgrown. The site was partially refurbished and a number of different ventures including nightclubs and restaurants tried to bring the gardens back into favor but none of them stuck. Now the Los Jardines de la Tropical belongs to the Havana Metropolitan Parks organization and efforts are underway to preserve the verdant tropical history of the site. Frequent rock concerts and dance festivals are held on the grounds, so while the tuxedoes and finery may have disappeared, the parties rage on.",gardens parks plants architecture
14,Presidio Modelo,"Nueva Gerona, Cuba",A series of five defunct panopticon prisons in Cuba.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/presidio-modelo,"Built between 1926 and 1928, the Presidio Modelo was designed to be a model prison by President-turned-Dictator Gerardo Machado. Each building is a circle of prison cells surrounding a center watchtower. The idea behind the design was that the watchtower would be darkened making it impossible for the inmates to tell if they were being watched. This would cause a sense of invisible omniscience. Fidel Castro, his brother Raul, and other survivors of the rebel attacks on Moncado Barracks were housed in these particular panopticons, which were designed to hold up to 2,500 prisoners. With Castro’s rise, the Presidio Modelo was used to hold political dissidents, homosexuals, Jehovah’s Witnesses, counter-revolutionaries, and any other “enemies” to the dictator. The population quickly ballooned to more than 6,000 inmates. Riots broke out in the prisons in 1961 due to overcrowding, and in 1966 they were permanently closed by the Cuban government. Today, the buildings remain open as a museum and national monument. The old administration building functions as a school and research center.",crime museums prisons crime and punishment abandoned

Encompassing 11 acres, the square was conceived by the French Urbanist Jean Claude Frostier and built on the Loma de los Catalanes hill during the Batista era. Until 1959 it was known as Plaza Civica, but following the Cuban Revolution the plaza was renamed by Fidel Castro. The vast Plaza de la Revolución is surrounded by grey administrative buildings that today house some of the most important offices of Cuba’s vast governmental bureaucracy. Huge political rallies are held in the area and the Castro brothers, along with the other leaders of the Cuban government, have addressed millions of Cubans from the square. The square is dominated to the north by the Jose Marti Memorial, which predates the revolution. A 109-meter-tall tower built from gray granite stones stands in front of the Palace of Revolution, the seat of the Cuban Government. The National Library, Cuba’s largest, and several other important government buildings are also located in the vicinity. Arguably one of the most iconic images in Cuba is a giant mural of Cuba’s revolutionary hero Ernesto “Che” Guevara. The can be found on the eastern facade of the Ministerio del Interior, a grey concrete monolith situated to the northern side of the plaza. The steel sculpture is modeled in the likeness of Che’s 1960 iconic photograph captured by Alberto Koda — the very same one to be found in every backpacker hangout the world over. Below, you can see his most famous utterance “Hasta La Victoria Siempre.” (“Always onwards onto victory”).  At night, the mural is lit from behind with a golden glow that is said to symbolize the spirit of Cuba’s revolution. In 2009, Che’s mural gained a companion. A portrait of Camilo Cienfuegos was installed on the adjacent Telecommunications Building with the words “Va Bien, Fidel” emblazoned below. The Plaza de la Revolución is the administrative focal point of Cuba — the buildings, ministries and governmental divisions that operate from the plaza form an integral part of present-day Cuba. When Pope Jean Paul II had held Mass in the Plaza back in January 1998, nearly a million Cubans congregated at the location. The plaza captures the raw spirit and heritage of Cuba. A few memorials and sculptures like the contemplative man in front of the Jose Marti Memorial and the Monumento El Legado Cultural Hispánico behind the National Library capture the varied and long cultural heritage of the Communist nation. A trip to the country would be incomplete without visiting this square. Adapted with Permission from Andy of Go Apocalypse.",politics

Built in 1930 and operated by Americans until the Cuban Revolution of 1959, its eclectic architectural mishmash of Art Deco, Moorish, and neo-colonial styles distinguised the hotel from its Caribbean contemporaries. Glamorous guests arrived immediately and haven’t stopped since. Its guestbook reads like a who’s-who of superstars from all walks of culture; few places on Earth can claim to have hosted Mickey Mantle, Ernest Hemingway, Yuri Gagarin, Jean Paul Sartre, Naomi Campbell, and Jesse Ventura. Perhaps most notorious of all, the hotel played host to a mob summit of the Cosa Nostra families in 1946, which Francis Ford Coppola would later dramatize in The Godfather: Part II. Glamor and mafia aside, the Hotel Nacional had always been chased by a darker reality that remains palpable to this day. From colonial powers, unaffiliated pirates, and nuclear terror, the hotel seemed destined to be under siege. Two giant cannons used in costal defense remain on prominent display, reminding visitors that the hotel was constructed atop the site of the 18th century Santa Clara Battery. Daily historic tours of the hotel touch on more delicate, recent history in the form of broad mentions of a nuclear bunker on premises, dating back to 1962 when Hotel Nacional served as Fidel Castro’s headquarters for aerial defense during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Around this time, anti-aircraft machinery was installed on the lawn and reinforced trenches were dug beneath the gardens, traces of which still dot the grounds. With over eighty years of the good life and skirmishes under its belt, the Hotel Nacional is now a state-sanctioned national monument where people from all walks of life can book a night or two to commune with the giants of history, no matter which version you prefer.",bunkers nuclear places to stay hotels

The town gained it’s significance on January 27, 1924, the day of Lenin’s funeral in Moscow, when thousands of local Cuban people gathered on the hill on the outskirts of town to pay tribute to the former soviet leader. The events on the hill —formerly called Loma del Fortin — inspired the socialist mayor of Regla, Antonio Bosch, to rename the hill Colina Lenin, and he planted an olive tree to commemorate the late leader. It was the first monument to honor Lenin built outside of the USSR. Over the following years, the Colina Lenin was the stage for numerous demonstrations against some of the oppressive Cuban governments and dictatorships. The site was attacked many times, but there was particularly violent day in 1930 when during a demonstration, protesters were attacked by soldiers of President Gerardo Machado and the olive tree was cut down. (A new olive tree was planted before long.) Sixty years after the death of Lenin, in 1984, a bronze sculpture of Lenin’s face created by the Cuban artist Thelma Marin was added to the site, and can still be seen there today. Surrounding the bronze sculpture are twelve white human figures, symbolizing solidarity with the October Revolution in Russia. Today the site is a national monument of the Republic of Cuba, and there is a museum on the site detailing much of the history of the area. Adapted with Permission from Andy of Go Apocalypse.

18,Finca Vigía,"Havana, Cuba",The house that birthed The Old Man and The Sea is now a museum devoted to the old man who wrote it.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/finca-vigia,"Writer and man’s-man Ernest Hemingway moved to Cuba in the 1930s, staying in hotels and tripping across the world, but rather quickly after coming to the island, the author bought Finca Vigía which would be his home and office for some of the most important works of his career. The 15-acre property was originally built in 1886 just outside of Havana. Hemingway purchased the home for himself and his third wife in 1939 and he would live in the residence until 1960, just one year prior to his death. The colorful writer filled the home with letters, big game trophies from his African hunting trips, books, and cats to make himself feel at home. It was during this time that the author took an interest in breeding cats, leading to the population of six-toed mutant cats still found at his home in Florida. During his time in the Cuban villa, Hemingway also wrote a great deal of his masterpiece For Whom The Bell Tolls, about the Spanish Civil War, and penned the entirety of The Old Man and the Sea, for which he would go on to earn a Pulitzer Prize and a Nobel Prize for Literature. The vibrant Cuban culture and inviting climes at Finca Vigía seemed to do the author well. After Hemingway’s suicide in 1961, the house was preserved in his memory but began to fall into disrepair in the 1990s. In 2005 Finca Vigía was restored via an unprecedented collaboration between US and Cuban organizations. The home is now known as the Museo Ernest Hemingway and the home is preserved as it was when Hemingway lived in it. The museum features such items as unpublished writings, his original typewriter, and even his fishing boat, Pilar, which inspired his Pulitzer Prize-winning novella.",pet cemeteries pools boats towers eccentric homes literature homes museums
19,Viaje Fantástico,"Havana, Cuba",No one knows the meaning behind this giant sculpture of a nude woman with a fork riding a rooster in Havana.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/viaje-fantastico,"There’s a mysterious brass statue in Havana’s Plaza Vieja. A woman sits atop her big, feathery mount, her voluptuous form completely naked except for the stilettos on her feet. A massive forks rests on her right shoulder. The rooster, ever so stoic, gazes ahead. No one knows the meaning behind the puzzling sculpture. The piece is called Viaje Fantástico, so perhaps she’s heading off on an adventure to some sort of nudist dinner party. Or, as some online theories speculate, it could have a more sexual connotation given the rooster’s association with male genitalia. Or, maybe, it’s just a figure of the sculptor’s imagination and has no greater symbolism at all. Recent tour guides have suggested it is meant as a tribute to the long history of prostitution in Havana. The nude woman is earning her meals (fork and chicken) by selling herself. Yet, she is unabashed by this behavior, as seen in the defiant look on her face. Roberto Fabelo installed the nugget of art in Plaza Vieja in 2012 without explanation or context. The artist, who won the country’s 2004 National Arts Award, frequently features nude women with birdlike appearances in his work.

20,Bacardi Building,"Havana, Cuba","After the Cuban Revolution, the famous rum company had to leave their swanky headquarters behind.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bacardi-building,"In 1930, the Bacardi rum company opened a new headquarters: a gorgeous Art Deco building on the edge of Old Havana. In 1960, Bacardi left Cuba after the newly installed revolutionary government confiscated their Cuban assets, including the aforementioned headquarters that by then was a prominent landmark in the capital city. Bacardi was founded in Santiago de Cuba in 1862, taking advantage of Cuba’s status as largest producer of sugar in the Caribbean to launch what would eventually become perhaps the most recognizable brand of rum in the world. The early decades of the 20th century were boom times for Cuba and Bacardi alike, with World War I making the sugar trade particularly lucrative and Prohibition in the U.S. making Havana a popular party destination for American tourists. These flush times led to a good deal of new construction in Havana, much of it in the Art Deco style that was wildly popular at the time. The Bacardi Building is regarded as a signature masterpiece of Havana Deco and is likewise considered to be one of the finest Art Deco buildings in Latin America. At the time of its completion, the 12-story Bacardi Building was Havana’s first skyscraper and for decades thereafter continued to be the city’s tallest building and one of its principal landmarks. Characterized by a facade of red granite, golden glazed tiles, brass fixtures, and colorful terracotta reliefs of nude nymphs designed by Maxfield Parrish, the building terminates in a stepped, ziggurat-inspired tower topped with a bronze rendition of Bacardi’s bat logo. The bat motif can also be found throughout the building’s richly decorated interior, along with familiar Art Deco details such as geometric patterns, natural imagery, rich wood paneling, and mural paintings. In 2003, the Office of the City Historian of Havana completed renovated the building to put some shine back in its Roaring 20s splendor. Although it is still used as an office building (primarily for tour operators) and thus not generally open to the public, visitors can see the lower floors as well as a little-known mezzanine bar that was once the private watering hole of the Bacardi family. You cannot, however, order a Bacardi at the Bacardi Building bar, as the company is still engaged in an intense trademark dispute (aka the “Rum Wars”) with the Cuban government involving intellectual property (particularly the “Havana Club” brand) confiscated after the revolution.

21,Cuba's Abandoned Nuclear Plant Construction,"Juraguá, Cuba",A nuclear power plant abandoned along with an international allegience.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cuba-s-abandoned-nuclear-plant-construction,"In 1976, Cuba and the Soviet Union decided to build and co-manage a nuclear power plant in Juragua. This project was never completed and the work was abandoned in 1992 with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the termination of Soviet economic aid to Cuba. The original plan was to produce two 440 megawatts reactors, expected to cover 15% of Cuba’s energy needs, which was heavily dependent on imported oil. The US strongly opposed the project due to its close proximity to the Florida Keys. Today, one can observe the huge facilities, including the dome, which can be seen from as far as Cienfuegos.

22,John Lennon Statue,"Havana, Cuba","His music once banned in Communist Cuba, John Lennon is now immortalized in bronze by Castro, who considers Lennon a ""fellow dreamer.""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/john-lennon-statue,"It’s no surprise that the music of John Lennon and the Beatles was banned from Communist Cuba in the 1960s and 70s. Cuban authorities considered the music “ideological diversionism,” and decadent American influence during a time of revolution. Young Cubans intrigued by the cultural revolution happening in the U.S. and Europe could sense what they were being denied access to, but could get only a small taste of the 60s by quietly listening to smuggled Beatles tapes in dark rooms. Twenty years after John Lennon’s death, Castro made a complete 180; no longer was his music banned, instead Lennon was to be celebrated as a hero. Castro unveiled a shiny new bronze statue of Lennon in the new John Lennon Park, screened a documentary on Lennon shot by his personal cinematographer, and organized a Lennon tribute concert in 2000. The reason for honoring this musical icon? “I share his dreams completely. I too am a dreamer who has seen his dreams turn into reality.” Lennon was also harassed by the US government in the later years of his life, and Cuba considers him a rebel and a victim; a kindred spirit to Cuba’s relationship with the US. While the glasses have been stolen and vandalized off his face, a security guard at the park who sometimes sits on the bench with Lennon will reportedly put the glasses on the statue if you ask him. On Obscura Day - March 20th, 2010 - Obscuraphiles gathered at John Lennon Park in Havana, Cuba.  In the John Lennon Park, the statue is on one of the benches of the park, nearer the corner of streets 17th and 6th.",music parks monuments statues
23,Che Guevara Mausoleum,"Santa Clara, Cuba",This imposing memorial contains the remains of Che Guevara — and 29 other guerrillas who died with him in Bolivia.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/che-guevara-mausoleum,"Standing high on a hill overlooking the city, a soaring bronze statue of Che Guevara bears witness to the status of Santa Clara, Cuba as the “city of Che.” The city was the site of the last conflict of the Cuban Revolution. Fulgencio Batista’s last attempt to retain power was disrupted by forces commanded by Guevara, who derailed an armored train carrying ammunition, heavy weapons, and 300 soldiers. Ultimately overrunning the city’s demoralized defensive forces, the revolutionaries achieved ultimate victory with Batista’s flight from Cuba a mere 12 hours after the Battle of Santa Clara. In recognition of this historic event, the boxcars remain in their derailed configuration even unto this day, with the bulldozer used to rip up the train tracks standing triumphantly nearby. To further commemorate the battle, the Cuban government began construction on a Guevara memorial in Santa Clara in 1982. Officially opened on December 28, 1988, the memorial included the aforementioned statue, a museum detailing the life of Guevara, and an expansive tiled parade ground. What it did not initially include, however, was a mausoleum. This is because Guevara had died in Bolivia in 1967, executed by Bolivian military forces after leading an ill-fated and poorly-managed insurgency in the South American country. His body had been dumped in an unmarked mass grave, where it remained undiscovered until 1997. His remains were identifiable due to, among other things, his hands; they were missing, having been amputated from his corpse 30 years prior and sent to Buenos Aires for fingerprint identification to verify that the executed rebel was indeed the famous Che Guevara. His remains — along with those of six other guerrillas found in the same grave — were returned to Cuba and buried with military honors on October 17, 1997, all under the memorial that had already been built for Guevara ten years previously. Subsequent excavations in Bolivia have brought an additional 23 combatants’ remains to rest in the starkly rectilinear memorial to Guevara. Visitors are forbidden from bringing any personal effects into the complex. The museum includes Guevara’s rifle (a .30-cal M2 carbine), medical certificates, field binoculars, and water bottle, as well as pictures of the revolutionary smoking cigars and playing golf.",communist monuments mausoleums war memorial

A master of neo-caveman artistry, Morillo undertook the massive project of portraying world history up until the age of humans on a rock wall in the Viñales Valley. Spanning from early mollusks and other ancient sea-organisms, the rock face mural moves through the age of the dinosaurs, and ends with three giant red human figures. Both lauded as brilliant in its simplicity, and decried as an eyesore, it has taken a massive effort from the community to maintain the mural after the death of its creator. Recently, a project to restore the paint and colors began. Unfortunately, the project took close to five years, and cost a great deal of money, once again flinging the mural into debate. Along with touch-ups to the color and design, measures have been taken to prevent erosion of the rocks around the mural. Although the mural itself is often labeled as overhyped, the lush Viñales Valley is worth visiting and was given status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999.

26,Baconao Park,"Santiago de Cuba, Cuba",Roam the cradle of the Cuban Revolution with life-sized dinosaurs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baconao-park,"Santiago de Cuba is known as the “Cradle of the Revolution.” The southern city holds a claim to fame in Cuba for being the staging area for Fidel Castro’s raid on the Moncada Barracks in 1953. Although the raid led to Castro’s arrest, it is accepted as the beginning of the Cuban Revolution. With this nationalist framework, Baconao Park, 20 kilometers from Santiago de Cuba, has developed as a microcosm of Cuba’s history and culture. Although at times the attractions in the park seem unrelated and even a little bizarre, they all recall one of the glories of Cuba’s past and they start from the very beginning. One of the main highlights of the park is the Valle de Prehistoria, a few acres of tropical vegetation complete with 200 roaming dinosaurs of the Jurassic Period. Adding to the strangeness of the exhibit, the dinosaurs were all constructed by inmates from a local prison. Moving chronologically through history, the park also features a lush lagoon and a typical village of the Taino, a pre-Colombian Caribbean people. Visitors can pull up to the Taino village and grab drinks at the bar before taking a dip at the beach nearby. Along with a range of natural history, Baconao also has a collection of 2,500 miniature car models and a museum dedicated to the attack on Moncada. Although the attractions scattered over 330 square miles draw many visitors, Baconao’s focus is always the revolution. Granjita Siboney, a small farm on the land, is the very place where Fidel and his rebels planned their July 26th movement. The farm includes artifacts from the rebels such as weapons, uniforms and what Santiago de Cuba’s tourist website describes as “countless memories of those days.” Baconao is filled with untold mystery and a strong Cuban pride and sense of nationalism. How these ideas exactly relate to miniature cars and models of dinosaurs is unclear, but thousands of visitors from across Cuba seem to understand well enough. The park contains a variety of attractions. Great Rock (Gran Piedra) The Great Rock is a large rock of volcanic origin, measuring 51 m (167 ft) long, 25 m (82 ft) high, and 30 m (98 ft) wide. Its estimated weight is more than 63 thousand tons. It is possible to climb 459 stone steps to the summit of the rock, and stand 1,234 meters above sea level for a panoramic view. It is said that on a dark night one can see the lights of Jamaica. Prehistoric Valley In the Valle de la Prehistoria visitors encounter dozens of life-size model dinosaurs sculpted in stone and other prehistoric creatures lurking in lush vegetation. Farm (Granjita Siboney) The farm is the place where the attackers of the Moncada Barracks (Cuartel Moncada) led by Fidel Castro, spent the night prior to the attack on July 26, 1953. Botanical Garden There is also a 0.45 km (0.17 sq mi) garden, called Jardin Ave de Paraiso, dating from 1860, that was laid out on a former coffee plantation and features a series of colour-coded gardens with unique scents and displays in each. Museum of History of Terrestrial Transport The museum displays over 2,500 small-scale car replicas. Aquarium The aquarium is 30 m (98 ft) deep, and has a submarine tunnel, and a Dolphinarium.

In the 19th century, Cuba was the world’s leader in sugar production, and was the first of the Latin American countries to have a railroad - just after the US, Great Britain, Belgium, and Germany. The outdoor steam engine museum was opened in 2009 in the Historic District of Havana, and displays a selection of remaining steam engines built by the American Baldwin Locomotive Works Company. Included is the locomotive 1112, which is the third oldest machine preserved in Cuba, and was used the film “Jose Marti,” directed by filmmaker, Fernando Perez. The museum’s opening marked the 172nd anniversary of Cuba’s first railway travel from Havana to Bejucal on November 19th, 1837, and the 490th anniversary of the founding of the town San Cristobal.

The small sign by the road says: “Parque Prehistórico de Referencia Nacional. Paleontology. Biology. Anthropology. Natural Medicine” which is just the first indication of the eclectic offerings ahead. The park is full of plants and specimens that Coro has collected or that people have sent him from all corners of the earth. He encases his specimens in crude concrete pillars with glass viewing windows built in, and he knows the history of each and every piece. In addition to the collection of rocks, shells, and fossils Coro grows endemic, medicinal, and prehistoric plants. Coro will give you a very animated tour if he catches you checking out the park, and his historical descriptions are intermingled with wonderful philosophical musings. “I am ignorant,” he constantly says, “but I love to learn.” He is simply delighted by all things ancient. His enthusiasm shows in the cement dinosaur sculptures throughout the park which are more impressionistic than representative of any firm anatomy. There are also scattered pieces throughout the park that explore the development of ancient man through rough stone figures which look like they hail from the time of hunters and gatherers. While there is no admission fee to the park, Coro will ask for a donation for the tour. However if you want to bring him, or send him, a specimen, he will take very good care of that donation as well. Adela Azcuy No. 6 Norte.

29,S.S. San Pasqual Shipwreck,Cuba,"Former WWI oil tanker played a variety of roles in history, its tantalizing rum-flavored scent being the only constant.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ss-san-pasqual-shipwreck,"In 1920, The S.S. San Pasqual was launched by the Pacific Marine Construction Company in San Diego as one of the oil tanker ships of the World War I Emergency Fleet. In 1921, she was damaged by a storm and docked until 1924, when she was purchased by Old Times Molasses Company of La Havana and used to store molasses in Santiago, Cuba. In 1933, she sank off the coast of Cayo Las Brujas, where she remains to this day. Legend has it that due to rumors of the boat being haunted, no one ever recovered the stored sugarcane after she went down. Now, 80 years later, the sugarcane has fermented, producing a ship full of rum. “And it is true that when we toured the ship, over dozens of yards around, a delicious smell of rum just tickled our nostrils,” says an explorer who recently visited the now abandoned ship. The same year it sank, the SS San Pasqual was hauled up and purposely run aground. It was then equipped with machine guns and cannons, and used during the World War II as a lookout for German submarines. At that time a bridge connected the ship to the shore, but it was eventually destroyed by weather. The Pasqual is also unusual in that it is a large concrete ship, which are no longer built and of which only a few dozen examples still remain. During the Cuban revolution, she served as a prison for Che Guevara’s army. Since then, the ship has hosted fishing clubs competitions as well served as a base for divers. Eventually, the ship was converted to a 10-bedroom hotel, now closed. The ship is still accessible by boat from the mainland.

Opened in 1837, Cementerio la Reina is now crumbling in some areas, but is still a magnificent place. For much of the 19th and 20th-centuries, Cienfuegos was one of the most important sugar-producing areas in Cuba. Many of the people buried in this cemetery were members of wealthy plantation families. Their tombs reveal a great deal of history about the city. The most outstanding feature of the cemetery by far is the remarkable statuary. One particularly striking example is the monument called “Sleeping Beauty,” a tribute to a 24-year-old woman who some like to say died of a broken heart (though others say she succumbed to a cholera epidemic). Taking a close look at the graves gives an additional glimpse of the city’s colonial past. Some tombs are marked with the regiment symbols of the Spanish armies that fought unsuccessfully to hold onto Cuba, Spain’s richest colony, in the Cuban War of Independence. The caretakers also double as guides and provide tours around the cemetery to discuss its rich history.

The enormous, hand-rolled item is the work of master cigar roller Jose Castelar Cairo, locally known as “Cueto.” Cueto is no ordinary cigar roller—before creating this behemoth of a smoke, the Cuban master had set four previous world records. His first attempt was in April of 2001 with a cigar measuring about 36 feet. In May of 2003, he rolled a roughly 49-foot-long cigar, followed by about a 70-foot record in April of 2005. Cueto became a living legend in Havana, Cuba. On May 3, 2011 he rolled set a Guinness World Record recorded with a monster cigar measuring 268 feet.

The items inside the small, two-room building detail the history of what’s been touted as the first defeat of U.S. imperialism in Latin America. In April 1961, at the height of the Cold War, about 1,400 exiled Cubans landed in Cuba with the goal of overthrowing Fidel Castro. The operation was planned by the Central Intelligence Agency, which opposed Castro’s communist policies and ties with the Soviet Union. The invasion failed. About 100 of the invading troops were killed, and the majority of the survivors were taken prisoner and later returned to the United States. More than 170 members of the Cuban Armed Forces were killed and more than 500 were wounded during the battles. This museum includes exhibits detailing the invasion and counter-attack, the types of weapons used, how the Cuban troops lived and trained, details of the Cuban troops who were killed, the impact on civilians, and how American prisoners-of-war were treated.

As the year came to an end, the number of people attending church decreased, supposedly because they preferred staying at home in bed during the (by Cuban standards) chilly mornings. Francisco’s plan to solve this was as ingenious as it was simple: He would gather a group of children and tell them to make as much noise as possible to make sure that people were awake in time for mass. The children gathered pots, pans, maracas, tins full of pebbles, and whatever they could find, and it worked! In fact, it became such a success that a decree was issued 15 years later that the noisy parade was not allowed to start before 4 a.m. This would evolve into one of Cuba’s most popular festivities, the Parrandas de Remedios. The celebrations evolved over the years, and took a new turn when eight neighborhoods formed two rival groups, El Carmen (the hawk) and San Salvador (the rooster), competing against each other by creating the most elaborate decorations, making the most noise and setting off the most massive fireworks. Today tens of thousands of rockets are placed along a long line in the city streets, while pyrotechnics run on each side with a torch setting them on fire. Unfortunately this massive display of fireworks has come with a price; accidents have occurred in which dozens of people have been seriously injured by the explosions.

At the zenith stands a large bust of José Martí, the nation’s martyr and patron saint. José Martí, the 19th century poet politician who dedicated his life to the liberation of Cuba from Spain, is one of the most important figures in the island’s history. His bust was placed atop Pico Turquino in 1953, to commemorate a century since Martí’s birth. Fittingly, it also happened to be the year Fidel Castro’s Cuban Revolution began. As a youth in the mid-1800s, Martí was deported to Spain for disloyalty to the crown. He spent several years in academia, earning degrees in philosophy and law and teaching university. After moving around Latin America, he returned to Cuba, only to be deported once more and separated from his family. Martí lived the rest of his life in exile, working as a journalist and championing the cause of Cuban independence. While in exile in New York City, he founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party. As a politician, he generated support for the movement, raising funds and giving speeches. In 1895, he returned to Cuba once more, this time at the head of an army. Martí landed on the island’s east coast, fighting for what would be Cuba’s third war of independence. While the rest of his unit was retreating, Martí charged directly at the Spanish line against orders. He was killed in a final display of rebellion. After three more years of fighting, Cuba achieved independence with the intervention of the United States. Though sovereign in name, Cuba wasn’t truly independent until Fidel Castro’s revolution. The Cuban Revolution launched in 1953—the centennial of Martí’s birth, and the same year his bust was placed upon Pico Turquino. The bust was constructed by Jilma Madera, known best for her “Christ of Havana.” Martí’s effigy was delivered to its current location by Celia Sanchez, the feminist icon of the Cuban revolution rumored to be Castro’s lover. From his vantage point of nearly 7,000 feet, he symbolically watches over an independent Cuba, the nation whose freedom he died fighting for. It is illegal to hike to the peak without a licensed guide. Tours can be booked from EcoTour, located in Santiago de Cuba, for 130 CUC (roughly equivalent to US $130). Alternatively, one can book a taxi and hire guide directly from the National Park's base, but given the high expense of gas for the 2-hour drive, the cost amounts to about the same. Previously, hikes could be done in a 2-day overnight stay, but due to an unusually dry year, the Cuban government has limited trips to 1 day. As a result, you must begin by 7 AM to get back before nightfall. The hike itself ranges from 9-12 hours depending upon your pace. Bringing your own snacks is recommended, as the EcoTour lunch provided is just a sandwich with sausage.",communist monuments revolution communism mountains monuments sculptures statues
39,El Cristo de la Habana,"Havana, Cuba","A colossal statue with a controversial past, forgotten for more than 30 years.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-cristo-de-la-habana,"In the 1950s, Cuba was governed by a dictatorship under the control of the United States, with Fulgencio Batista as president. Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were slowly taking command of the entire island overthrowing power to instate a communist republic. It was a time of great turbulence and uncertainty for the Cuban people. Amidst this chaos, Batista commissioned a colossal statue representing a Blessing Christ (similar to the famous one in Rio de Janeiro). It was a last-ditch effort to gain popular support, and would have been ready just in time for Christmas celebrations. The statue was a simple but impressive piece made by Jilma Madera, a well known Cuban sculptor. It was made in Italy, carved from Carrara marble, and blessed by Pope Pius XII. Sadly, bad luck seemed to follow the monument. Two weeks after its inauguration, Fidel Castro and his militants conquered Havana and took command of the island. With religion made illegal and the military zone near the statue under strict control, the Blessing Christ lay forgotten for more than 30 years under a crescent vegetation, until the government reopened the site in the 90s. These days, the statue can be found in a beautiful park in the “pueblo” of Casablanca, in front of the harbor of Havana. From its hilltop perch you can see an incredible view of the city and the port.  The site is a short taxi ride from old Havana (via the tunnel), and is a beautiful 20-min walk from the tourist-filled Morro Castle that dominates the entry to Havana’s harbour. You can also cross the harbour via ferry, climb a little hill, and you will rewarded with the best place in town for your Sunday afternoon excursion.",communism christianity sculptures statues
40,Cementerio Santa Ifigenia,"Santiago de Cuba, Cuba",A tomb in this cemetery holds soil from every country in Latin America.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cementerio-santa-ifigenia,"The cemetery that holds Cuba’s soul. Inside the Santa Ifigenia Cemetery in Santiago de Cuba resides a tomb that holds a handful of soil from every country in Latin America. It is the tomb of Jose Marti, a Cuban patriot and central figure in Cuba’s War of Independence from Spain. The soil is there to symbolize Marti’s influence in the hemisphere. As in much of Latin America, and indeed the world, cemeteries in Cuba are a grand affair. Many cemeteries display museum-worthy funerary statuary and elaborate mausoleums that line broad avenues crisscrossing manicured landscapes. These cemeteries hold the physical remains of the deceased, yes, but some also hold the country’s historical legacy, its very soul. The Cementerio Santa Ifigenia in Cuba’s far eastern city of Santiago de Cuba is one such place. When wandering among the cemetery’s blindingly white mausoleums visitors will see many examples of ornate funerary architecture. Sorrowful winged angels draped across tombs and portraits, or images of the deceased carved into stone, decorate the polished granite. Many tombs are embellished with massive granite crosses, polished brass, and wrought iron fencing. Founded in 1868, Cementerio Santa Ifigenia had to be moved shortly thereafter to accommodate the city’s growth. There, it continued to grow and covers around 32 acres and is now the second-largest cemetery in Cuba after the Cementerio Colon in Havana. Much of Cuba’s recent history is displayed across the cemetery’s wide avenues. Cuba’s notable men and women, its national heroes, rest here. That cultural legacy, along with the cemetery’s magnificence, is what gives Santa Ifigenia its value. In fact, Cuban cultural legacy within Santa Ifigenia is considered so precious that the necropolis was designated a National Monument in 1979. The most culturally significant and frequently visited grave is that of Jose Marti, Cuba’s national hero. His tomb is number 134 and is located in the cemetery’s southern section. Marti advocated for Cuba’s independence from Spain and died fighting for it. He was a journalist, professor, essayist, translator, and poet who lived throughout the world including New York City where he worked as a journalist for The Sun and other prominent newspapers for almost 20 years. Marti’s writings influenced important freedom movements throughout the Americas. Marti is known for his poems as much as his political writings. Every Cuban school child can recite at least parts of Marti’s poems. One of his most well-known poems requests that he not be buried in darkness but facing the sun, and that his tomb contains a Cuban flag and a bouquet of flowers. Marti could not have suspected when he wrote those words how they would be interpreted literally over a century later. Marti’s tomb is a large, imposing tower. The design and positioning of Marti’s hexagonally shaped tomb allow his casket to always receive a ray of sunlight at any time of day, as long as the sun is out, sunlight shines on the coffin which is draped in a Cuban flag. Nearby, a bouquet of fresh flowers is always present. Massive pillars, each representing one of the six original Cuban provinces, support the tomb. The overall effect is stately, graceful, and dripping with symbolism. As befits such a culturally significant monument, a military escort guards the tomb 24 hours a day performing a changing of the guard every half hour. Crowds gather to watch the changing of the guard performed with military exactitude. The soldiers goose-step from the cemetery’s entrance to the tomb and execute the change. It is a beautiful ceremony to behold. Of course, Marti is just one of the Cuban notables buried in Santa Efigenia. The remains of Mariana Grajales also rest there. She was the mother of Antonio Maceo, a hero of the Cuban War of Independence who fought along with his brothers to free Cuba from Spain’s dominance. When Grajales was informed that her two sons had died fighting Spain, she replied that she still had more sons to give for the revolution. Notables from Cuba’s more recent past also rest at Santa Efigenia. These include Cuba’s first presidents, Carlos Manuel de Cespedes, and Tomas Estrada Palma. Also resting in the cemetery are Santiago natives, Emilio Bacardí-Moreau whose Bacardi Rum is consumed all over the world, and Compay Segundo, known for his musical group Buena Vista Social Club. A more controversial figure, dictator Fidel Castro, is also buried in Santa Ifigenia. Santiago is frequently overlooked by visitors to the island because it is so far from Havana and the western attractions. But if you want to take a peek into Cuba’s soul and learn more about its historical legacy, Santa Ifigenia is the place to do it.  Don't miss the changing of the guard at Jose Marti's tomb every half hour.",burial places cemeteries history & culture
41,Klein Curaçao,"Willemstad, Curaçao","Shipwrecks, ruins, and turtles are all that remain on this haunting Caribbean ghost island.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/klein-curacao,"After two hours sailing, bearing southeast from the old Dutch Caribbean outpost of Curaçao, travelers can find an abandoned island. Called Klein Curaçao (Dutch for “little”), it is a ghostly island that has been uninhabited for generations. Measuring just over half a square mile in size, the silent, flat coral atoll is home only to a deserted lighthouse, the shipwrecks of vessels it failed to save, several collapsed ancient stone buildings, and a burial site. Whilst many desert islands bring to mind tropical paradises, Klein Curaçao is a haunting, windswept place. The lighthouse, once painted a vibrant coral pink, was built in 1850. Standing alone in the centre of the island, it is now abandoned. The wooden stairs to the top of the lighthouse are still intact, as are the two stories of rooms that housed the lighthouse keepers; with no natural source of running water, it must have been a desolate place to live and work. In 1888 the German Navy attempted to build a base here as part of the hoped for Imperial colonization of the Deutsche Karibik, but were driven off by the windswept conditions of the remote outpost when a tropical storm swept away the first foundations of a wharf. Klein Curaçao neatly highlights the effects of the nature on the island. The northern side is a tropical paradise of palm trees, white beaches, and crystal waters. The southern, windward side, more exposed to the elements, is an unforgiving shoreline of pounding surf, and ragged coral reefs. Here lie the shipwrecks of Klein Curaçao. Looming on the southern beach is the hulking rusted remains of the oil tanker Maria Bianca Guidesman, which ran aground here in the 1960s. Gradually being eroded away by the merciless waters of the Caribbean sea, already half of the tanker has sheared off and washed away. Next to the Maria Bianca is the remnants of a once glorious 30 foot luxury boat cruelly smashed against the sharp coral reefs. Dotting much of the island are crumbling stone structures that looked like simple dwellings, perhaps once home to passing fishermen. On the northeastern end there is also a simple burial site, marked by a bleached plain wooden cross without a name. Today, day trips are offered by several companies operating out of neighboring Curaçao that sail to the island by catamaran. A visit to Klein Curaçao is a visit to a remote, ghostly island, surrounded by waters where for many years the principal profession was piracy. And where all you will have for company are shipwrecks, turtles, lizards, and a beautifully faded pink lighthouse, gradually falling into ruin. Two hours sail south east from Curacao.

42,The Abandoned Pietermaai Mansions,"Willemstad, Curaçao",The mouldering manses of wealthy colonials still pock the streets of a Curaçao neighborhood.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-abandoned-pietermaai-mansions-willemstad-curacao,"The island of Curaçao in the southern Caribbean sea was colonized by the Dutch West India Company in 1634. With no natural gold deposits, the small island had been passed over by other European naval powers, but the Dutch found it an ideal base for their burgeoning slave trade with Africa. Building the capital city of Willemstad in the natural bay of St. Anna, the colony soon prospered. The Dutch lined the inner harbour with brightly painted buildings that mirrored the architecture of Amsterdam. Prior to the slave trade, the principal business of the Caribbean was piracy, so the Company ringed the city with forts. As the colony prospered and grew, the walled city could no longer contain enough housing, so a narrow strip of land bordering the sea was developed into a residential district. Named Pietermaai, the new neighborhood was set aside for the wealthier merchants, bankers and ships captains of the Dutch West India Company. In addition to colonial mansions along wide breezy boulevards, it was littered with theaters and fine restaurants. After the Dutch abolished slavery in 1863 the colony’s fortunes began to fade until oil was discovered in 1914 and the Royal Dutch Shell company built a refinery. As the refinery, located on the northern side of the Willemstad harbour, prospered, the exclusive Pietermaai district’s fortunes began to wane. By the end of the 20th century, with the merchants and bankers of the West India Company long since departed, the colonial mansions began to crumble and fall into neglect. The once fashionable neighbourhood steadily fell into ruin. But within the last 10 years the Pietermaai has begun to show signs of revival. As tourism began to increase, many of the colorful mansions have been restored into boutique hotels, diving centers, and restaurants. But many of the buildings remain dilapidated, living side by side with the newer developments. A local initiative has seen many of the empty buildings set aside as giant canvases for local artists. The crumbling plasterwork is now painted over with giant murals, many of which depict the slave trade which once characterized the colony. A walk through the Pietermaai neighbourhood is filled with beautifully faded mansions, covered with wild tropical flowers, through which the original coral pinks and pastel blue plaster work can still be seen. Once home to the wealthy merchants and ship captains of a colonial trading company long since disappeared into history, today the boulevards are undergoing a steady and colorful renaissance.",mansions eccentric homes homes abandoned
43,Mikvé Israel-Emanuel Synagogue,"Willemstad, Curaçao",The floor of the oldest surviving synagogue in the Americas is entirely covered in sand.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mikve-israelemanuel-synagogue,"Mikvé Israel-Emanuel Synagogue—often referred to as the Snoa, another term for synagogue—is the oldest surviving synagogue and Jewish congregation in the Americas. This is more than enough to make it a place of historical significance but it has another element that makes it unusual. The floor is entirely covered in sand. Founded in Curaçao in 1651, the congregation’s original name translates to The Hope of Israel. The Mikvé Israel-Emanuel Synagogue itself began construction in 1729, was completed in 1732, and has been in continuous use ever since. The synagogue is tucked into a quiet street in the Punda neighborhood of Willemstad, the historic capital city of Curaçao. Though it has an inconspicuous exterior, once you step inside, you’ll find rows of pews, towering chandeliers, and a shining mahogany bemah. As you walk around, your feet sink softly into the floor of sand. Spanish and Portuguese Jews from the Netherlands and Brazil were early settlers in the Caribbean islands, taking on influential roles in the local communities, and the Jewish community in Curaçao was notable among those in the New World. (Nearby the Hendrickplein Jewish Temple built in 1865 is also well worth a visit.) The reasons for the Jewish migration to the islands and the reason for the sand floor may be connected–an attempt to avoid persecution. As Jews made their new home in the Caribbean, fears of persecution lingered. The sand floor is said to have been there to muffle the sound of steps as a reminder of the secret Jewish services performed in the recent past. While that is one interpretation, the true origin of the sand-floored synagogue is largely mysterious. Nonetheless, the tradition has carried on in other far flung Jewish communities. Sand floor synagogues can be found in four other locations, in Jamaica, in Surinam, in Saint Thomas, and in the Portuguese Synagogue of Amsterdam. The building is in very good condition, and guests can attend the regular services. You can also check out their Jewish Cultural Historical Museum, which contains information on the island’s Jewish community and history as well as artifacts such as old scrolls and spice boxes. The city of Willemstad, a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site, looks at first glance like an Amsterdam lookalike, though it has a population of only around 150,000. Curaçao, an island in the Caribbean just off the coast of South America, only gained autonomy from the Netherlands on October 10, 2010, which was the first time since the arrival of the Spanish in 1499 that the islanders regained political control.",synagogues religion sacred spaces
44,Cathedral of Thorns,"Willemstad, Curaçao",This living labyrinth made entirely of thorns is filled with art.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cathedral-of-thorns,"As you wander through this maze, look but don’t touch—everything is made from thorns. This prickly labyrinth is a work of visual art, with indentations in the walls to display different sculptures from modern artists. The Cathedral of Thorns is a work in progress. It was first conceived in 2014 by  the award-winning Dutch artist Herman Van Bergen, who continues to tweak this building-sized piece of art. The living labyrinth is made from sumpiñas, the thorns of Acacia tortuosa, a desert plant that is plentiful in Curaçao. Creating this building-sized piece of art became a community effort. Van Bergen enlisted local youth to help, some working on the construction and others collecting plant material. Visitors are invited to walk through the maze, experiencing what the artist describes as “a journey through a troublesome history toward a bright future.” Each of these extremes are represented by the “hostile yet beautiful thorns.” While experiencing the cathedral, you may even meet the artist himself as he fine-tunes his creation.",labyrinths mazes art outside plants
45,Williwood Sign,"Sint Willibrordus, Curaçao","This tiny tropical village was sick of anonymity so the locals made this sign, which actually changed the name of the town.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/williwood-sign,"Sint Willibrordus was once just a nice, if little known, village 12 miles northwest of Willemstad, the capitol of Curaçao, but the locals, tired of being overlooked, have now rebranded their small town as “Williwood” by building a cheeky, hillside monument. Previously, the remote town was best known for its grand church that dates back to the 1880’s, but in recent years the town’s independently constructed “Williwood” sign has taken the spotlight as the can’t miss attraction. Taking the nickname for the area and writing it large in a parody of California’s iconic Hollywood sign, enterprising citizens built a new identity for their town. The sign itself rests on a modest hill at the back of a barren soccer field and is prone to blowing over during storms, but the monument is so beloved by locals that people will run out before the gales are even over and fix any fallen letters, claiming bragging rights if they get there first. While the Williwood sign began as somewhat of a joke, its appeal took almost immediate hold and the town of Sint Willibrordus was officially renamed Williwood in 2011. Now visitors, of which there are markedly more, can buy hats, t-shirts, and other pieces of tat bearing the Williwood name with nary a celebrity to block traffic in sight.",signs
46,The Wreck of Air Aruba P4-YSA,"Willemstad, Curaçao","Like something out of a pulp adventure, this abandoned plane wreck is slowly being retaken by the Caribbean jungle.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-wreck-of-air-aruba-p4-ysa-willemstad-curacao,"Top of every intrepid explorer’s list must be to find a ruined airplane hidden away in a tropical locale. Bringing to mind the television show Lost or the 1986 film Romancing the Stone, there is just something haunting about coming across the wreckage of a plane slowly being reclaimed by nature. Just such a plane lies in waiting on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao. About half an hour drive south of the capital of Willemstad, just north of Kontiki Beach and nestled at the foot of the southern mountains surrounding the salt pans of Jan Thiel, lies the remnants of Air Aruba flight P4-YSA. Climbing inside, one finds that all the seats are gone, but the doors and remnants of the airline can still be seen. Overhead panels indicate the old reading lights and stewardess call buttons. Strewn on the floor amongst the derelict emergency oxygen masks are the signs indicating seat row numbers followed by aisle or window. Walking through the wrecked fuselage it looks like a plane that crashed into the tropical jungle decades ago and where all signs of the passengers have simply disappeared. As you walk forward carefully on the bared struts of the fuselage towards the pilot’s cabin, now home to wasps and pink jungle flowers, you can see that most of the machinery is still there. Altimeters, air pressure dials, countless electrical switches and fuel pump gauges, just as the pilot left them. The front glass has smashed inwards allowing vines and palm fronds to grow inside over the wrecked cockpit. The airplane was a turboprop airliner originally designed by the Nihon Aircraft Manufacturing Company of Japan. Built between 1962 and 1974, the NAMC YS-11s were capable of carrying 60 passengers and looked similar to the multipurpose American Douglas DC-3s. The one slowly disintegrating on a small island in the south Caribbean sea was bought and run by the commercial airline Air Aruba. Beginning as a short haul company in 1986, Air Aruba principally ran between the ABC islands of the Lesser Antilles: Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao. Rising costs led to the company declaring bankruptcy in 2000, by which time the airline was chartering flights to further destinations such as Domino, St.Maarten, and Miami. The first two planes in its fleet, bought in 1986, were the Japanese twin props, registration numbers P4-YSA and YSB. Both of the planes have suffered differing fates. One, YSB, currently lies in 40 feet of water in the reefs surrounding Aruba. Damaged beyond repair during Hurricane Lenny in 1999, it was intentionally sunk where it now enjoys a new lease of life as a popular scuba diving wreck. Its twin plane, YSA, ended up in Curaçao. At one point, the broken and wrecked plane, shorn of its wings and twin props, had been planned to be used as a restaurant. An adjoining brick and adobe structure on the starboard side of the plane was to house the kitchens, whilst diners enjoyed the unusual setting for their evening meal. But the restaurant never came to fruition. No records show who owned this forgotten plane, or how it came to be here. It seems more likely that it was moved rather than crashed, as no newspaper records tell anything about it. The NAMC YS-11s in general have quite a doomed history. Of the 182 originally built by the NAMC in Japan, there have been over 20 hull loss accidents leading to over 260 deaths. One of the planes, run by Korean Air, was hijacked in 1969 over North Korean airspace; the plane, its crew and passengers are still held in North Korean territory. In 1976 one of the planes, owned by Olympic Airways, crashed into the side of a mountain in Kozani, Greece. The history of the planes is one of forced landings, overshooting runways, and being ditched at sea. For now, the former Air Aruba plane falls gradually into ruin as the tropical forest slowly grows around it.",airplane graveyard aircraft airplanes
47,Boiling Lake,"Delices, Dominica","This mountaintop lake bubbles and steams in a perpetual boil, thanks to its direct link to the Earth's interior.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boiling-lake,"There’s nothing quite like a secluded lake. Passing through a thicket of trees or over a rugged trail, and suddenly catching a glimpse of that clear blue water, its surface sparkling like glass in the hot sun, and sipping the cool, refreshing water from the mountain springs that feed it. Or, on a particularly hot summer day, jumping headlong into it for a jolt of cold refreshment from head to toe. A mountain lake like that is universal in its appeal, and Dominica is no different. Except in one spot. In one particularly odd basin, pooled high atop Watt Mountain in Morne Trois Pitons National Park, the water simply isn’t that refreshing. In fact, it’s boiling hot. And while “boiling hot” is a common phrase used for hyperbole, visitors should not test the veracity of this claim – drinking or bathing in this water will result in death, or at least severe burns. Not that most visitors would be tempted to do such a thing. A thick cloud of balmy steam emanates from and surrounds the menacing lake, leaving no question as to how hot the water really is. But if that alone isn’t convincing enough, the swirling, bubbling maelstrom of churning water at the lake’s center confirms without a doubt that the water has been brought to a boil. Enchanted by evil magic as this body of water may seem, the phenomenon is actually quite simple, though rare. The bowl of rocky clay that forms this lake is not your average scoop in the ground – instead, this lake has a direct line to the molten subsurface of the Earth, with vents pumping scalding steam and gasses into the water, heating it to an instant boil. But magic or no magic, this perpetually boiling-then-evaporating body of water does seem to defy the laws of physics – or at least the laws of logic – and creates a strange and bemusing site at the top of this misty mountain.",geological oddities natural wonders water geology nature

According to the folklore of the indigenous Kalinago people of Dominica, the nearly 60-foot rock is home to a powerful spirit. Locals say a small white flower grows near the rock, however it blooms only one day a year. Anyone lucky enough to find this flower, should rub the bloom in the palm of their hand. Upon doing so, the legend says that if they point their palm towards someone they wish to have control over, while calling their name, they will have control over that person. However, it’s not all flowers and mind control. There are a number of large cracks on the surface of the rock, and it’s said that if you see the spirit of the rock living inside the rock, a loved one is sure to die soon afterwards. Although much of the story is local legend, there are some interesting observable truths. For example, there really is a white flower that blooms infrequently near the rock. If one does find the plant while it’s in bloom, a strong hallucinogenic and psychedelic tea is said to be able to be made from the leaves. At other times of the year when the flower is not in bloom, the leaves do not have the same effect.",mythology legends rocks geology
49,Wavine Cyrique (Secret Beach),"Rosalie, Dominica",The hike to this stunning waterfall on a black sand beach is not for the faint of heart.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wavine-cyrique-secret-beach,"This unique natural feature is one of many things that have given the Nature Isle a reputation as an outdoor adventurer’s playground—but getting to it is not for the faint of heart. It is one of the very few waterfalls that descends not into a lake or river, but directly onto a beach/into the sea (depending on the tide level at that time). At low tide, the water drops onto a large stretch of black sand beach, which you will almost definitely have to yourself. At high tide (not recommended as a time to visit), the falls drop straight into the Atlantic Ocean. It is especially magical on a sunny day when the waterfall causes rainbows. Even many locals have never visited, but those who have (mainly those who live on the east coast, or adventurous types) call it “Wavine Cyrique” or “Secret Beach.” The only way to reach this beach is by a series of rope ladders and tree roots that hang from the cliff face. After Hurricane Maria in 2017 destroyed the complex web of roots and ropes that used to serve as a ladder, locals have installed a sturdy new ladder with wooden rungs and strong ropes. Dominica’s tourist board advises that you only visit with a registered guide. Once you reach the beach, the waterfall’s icy cold water is perfect for a shower after the sweaty climb. It is a strange contrast to the warm ocean water washing over your feet. Wavine Cyrique is an idyllic place to sunbathe and play in the waterfall; but not for swimming in the ocean, due to large waves and a strong current.  Discover Dominica advise that you must visit with a registered guide, not alone. You can find a guide by visiting the Tourist Office in Roseau; or on days when a cruise ship is in port, many guides wait onshore. A lot of taxi drivers are also registered guides, so you can ask around amongst drivers. Registered guides wear ID tags or have them in the front of their mini-busses. Your guide will drive you to the spot, which is just south of Rosalie. The climb is not suitable for those with a fear of heights or vertigo. It requires a high level of fitness and moderate agility. The rope ladder rungs are quite far apart so it is more challenging for shorter adults and not suitable for children.",hiking waterfalls beaches water
50,Bubble Beach Spa,"Soufriere, Dominica",Thermal springs underneath the seabed provide the heat and bubbles for these beachside natural hot tubs.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bubble-beach-spa,"Dominica is a hotbed of the weird and wonderful things that nature has to offer. One of the most striking examples is this mineral-rich sea that fizzes like a vat of champagne due to volcanic gasses bubbling up from thermal springs on the seabed. While most tourists will experience this spectacular phenomenon—not to mention the plethora of colourful coral and sea life that it nourishes—by snorkelling or diving off at Champagne Reef, locals tend to head a little farther south, to Bubble Beach in the village of Soufriere. Run by Dale Mitchell, a Soufriere local who often goes by “Mr. Bubble,” the waters here offer the same fizzing wonder as Champagne Reef, but with added bonuses. Mitchell fashioned natural baths in the shallow parts of the sea, using rocks and sandbags to mark out the best areas to sit and maintain some of the potent heat of the springs. Depending on the tide, different spots in these baths range from pleasantly warm to almost unbearably hot. At most times of day, you can find local people of all ages (plus some fish and small crabs) in these baths, relaxing and enjoying the many supposed health benefits of the waters. They’ve been credited with everything from easing joint pain to preventing the itch of mosquito bites. Swim out in the deeper water to cool off and see various fish, corals and bubbles. Full-face masks, snorkels and flippers are available to rent on the beach. The excellently-maintained sandy beach features a bar with homemade rum punches, local beer and soft drinks served by Dale himself. Try his bush rum for a taste of the amazing Dominican-grown spices. It is a fantastic place to sit and enjoy the view of Scott’s Head, the tombolo at the southwest tip of the island where the Caribbean Sea meets the Atlantic Ocean. There is also a shaded area, changing rooms, sun-loungers for rent, a photo bench, and a massage bungalow. It is directly in front of St. Mark’s, one of the oldest and prettiest churches on the island decorated in red, blue, and yellow. Bubble Beach is an important hub for village life and is especially popular around sunset, when there is often food available. On Sundays, Mitchell often cooks up a big lunch for the many Soufriere residents who come together after church. Arrive before 2 p.m. if you want some food! Bubble Beach Spa is publicly accessible and free to use. However, it is recommended to put some money in the donation box, and spend generously at the bar if you can. This is a local man’s business that had to be rebuilt from total destruction after Hurricane Maria in 2017.  Take the local bus from Roseau to Soufriere. Ask to be dropped off near Bubble Beach or if the driver does not know it, ask for the village church. Follow the first turning right (towards the sea and the visible tower of the church) when you enter the village, and there is a sign for Bubble Beach at the end of the road, instructing you to turn right again. Bubble Beach is open at all times of day; if nobody is there and you want something, call Mr Bubble's number which is written on the bar. Remember to bring some cash for the donation box (as well as the bar and equipment rental).",minerals hot springs volcanoes beaches water
51,Jacko Steps,Dominica,"This historic hiding place, often used by people escaping slavery, is a testament to a heroic struggle for freedom.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jacko-steps,"Like many islands in the Caribbean, Dominica has a dark history concerning slavery but also bears testimony to the valiant fight of oppressed people for liberty. Jacko Steps marks the location of a camp formed by the eponymous Jacko, who in the mid-18th century escaped from Beaubois Estate after he was taken from his home in Africa by European enslavers. After settling a plateau in Dominica’s inland jungle, the place soon became a refuge for other people escaping slavery—who were known as “maroons”—as well as a center for organized resistance against oppression. For decades, Jacko and his fellow maroons fought successfully against the colonial troops, employing guerilla-style tactics and often taking their enemies by surprise. They continued on until their camp was discovered during an offensive by then-governor George Robert Ainslie in 1814, which led to the death of Jacko and many of his followers and the destruction of the camp. Today the place is a poignant reminder of the bloody colonial history, as well as the maroons’ fight against the brutal practice of slavery. From the 17th to 19th centuries, some five million enslaved men and women were taken from Africa to the Caribbean. Only one historical marker of the camp remains: A series of massive steps, cut into the rock by Jacko and his people leads down to the river and provided an alternate route to access—or escape—the camp. Apart from these steps, barely any physical evidence of the settlement remains. And still, as soon as one stands in the middle of the plateau surrounded by the thick, verdant jungle, the history of the place seems to invade one’s pores. With a little imagination, you begin to see the camp and its inhabitants around you.  Getting to Jacko’s Steps involves a hike through the jungle starting close to the roundabout in Pont Cassé on the road leading to Marigot. After reaching the plateau, you can either turn around to go back the way you came or, if you’re adventurous and fit, continue down the slippery steps to the Layou River, through which you can hike back to the road. If you choose the latter option, be careful, as it involves hiking through sometimes knee-deep water and the current can be strong.",jungle slavery colonialism
52,Los Tres Ojos,"Santo Domingo Este, Dominican Republic",This trio of Dominican cave lakes comprise a colorful biosphere of natural life.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/los-tres-ojos,"Hidden in a natural limestone cave in the lush surrounds of the Dominican Republic the small group of subterranean lakes known collectively as Los Tres Ojos (The Three Eyes) are home to a good number of animal species and some truly stunning natural vistas. Beginning life as prehistoric sinkholes the lakes were once underground caves that collapsed in on themselves and filled with water. The lakes are continually fed by an underground river that keeps the waters fresh and full. The constant flow into and out of the lakes brings a diversity of minerals, bacteria, and animal life into the site. This constant shifting causes the waters of the lakes to turn vibrant shades of greens and blues. In addition to the arresting colors the lakes are host to an abundance of turtles, bats, and fish. Surrounding each of the lakes is dense tropical foliage giving them the air of hidden jungle oases. The Three Eyes also welcome a vibrant and diverse population of another species: the tourist. The site has become a popular destination for travelers looking to experience a little bit of the natural magic that the Dominican Republic has to offer. The admission ticket costs 100 RD. If you want to see the fourth lake you need to pay an additional 25 RD at the boatsman at the fourth lake.",lakes subterranean sites caves natural wonders ecosystems water nature

Two years later, it was turned into the Meson de la Cava restaurant. The restaurant, considered one of the most distinguished in the area by both residents of and tourists to the Dominican Republic, is tucked into a natural limestone cave created by waves over billions of years. In addition to provisions from the OAS, the restaurant displays several of the valuable belongings found in the cave from previous occupants, which include the Taino Indians, buccaneers who hid in the caves before launching an attack on Santo Domingo, and the guerrillas who fought against the occupation by foreign forces in 1930. The restaurant has three entrances at street level, but visitors must descend a 40-foot spiral staircase to get to the lobby, which is filled with stalactites and stalagmites. While some might expect that the restaurant relies on its unique environs to draw visitors in, the Meson de la Cava is known for preparing some of the region’s best cuisine. Local, hand-selected ingredients are brought in daily, as is a catch from the Caribbean Sea.

The Taíno people are the Indigenous residents of Greater Antilles. It was the Taíno who greeted Christopher Columbus’s arrival in Hispanola (now the Dominican Republic) in 1492. Throughout the Spanish colonial period that followed, their culture was ruthlessly suppressed, and through both violence and disease their numbers greatly depleted. In 1561, colonist and early humanitarian Bartolomé de las Casas wrote: “There were 60,000 people living on this island [when I arrived in 1508], including the Indians; so that from 1494 to 1508, over three million people had perished from war, slavery and the mines. Who in future generations will believe this?” The caves are significant in Taíno mythology. Distinctive art made by the early Taíno are etched on rocks around the island and on stalagmites in caves across the island. Inside the cave you’ll find approximately 10 petroglyphs (engravings in the rock), and 472 pictographs (paintings on the walls). The art depicts a diverse range of subjects that includes humans, plants, animals, and abstract designs. In one room, known as the Water Mirror Gallery, the roof of the cave and the Great Panel can be seen in the reflection of an artificial lake. The Great Panel features a cave painting that depicts a Taíno funeral ritual. Cueva de las Maravillas was declared a national park in 1997, and the caves have been open to the public since 2003. Although the cave has come under criticism for the way in which paths and lighting were installed, possibly damaging some of the geologic features, it was awarded the 2003 Gold prize in the International Landscape Architecture Bienal Award.  Today, visitors can explore about 200 meters on footpaths that wind through the galleries. Visits to the cave are strictly controlled, in small groups with a guide.

Rolf Schulz, a German artist, decided at the age of 51 that he would leave his hometown, Hamburg, to pursue his dream of building a castle in the Dominican Republic. And so the Castillo Mundo King was born. The artist began this labor of love in 1990 and lived in the dwelling with no electricity or running water until he died, in January 2018. Before his death he would regale visitors with stories of UFOs and extraterrestrial life. His self-built palace now functions as an otherworldly art museum. The castle’s five floors are filled with several hundred pieces of surreal art, including an impressive collection of sculptures made by Haitian and Dominican artists (many of them exotic), as well as carvings in stone and wood, paintings, and murals. Those that climb the stairs all the way up to the top floor are met with a reward: The view looking out over the Bay of Puerto Plata is breathtaking.

Christopher Columbus wrote about the local Taino Indians amber-adorned shoes, which he exchanged for a necklace made of Baltic amber. Considered a semi-precious gem, amber is formed when tree sap fossilizes, sometimes catching plants, and animals in it. Amber mining has, over the centuries, been big business in the Dominican Republic. The German Bentz brothers made their fortune at the turn of the last century in another popular export: sugar. They built the opulent Villa Bentz in 1919 at the peak of their success. In later years hard times would force them to sell the mansion, after which it began to fall into disrepair. It was not until Didi and Aldo Costa restored it for their museum that it reclaimed its former beauty. In 1970, the Costa family moved to Puerto Plata and began the collection of amber that would eventually fill the museum. Curated with the assistance of the American Brandt Ghepart of the Museum of Natural History in Cleveland, the museum opened in March 1982.

57,Faro a Colon (Columbus Lighthouse),"Santo Domingo Este, Dominican Republic",The final resting place of Christopher Columbus - or possibly someone else.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/faro-a-colon-columbus-lighthouse,"In 1506, at the age of 55, the explorer Christopher Columbus died in Spain. But death was not the end of his adventures - his body continued to travel in a centuries-long shell game. Keep your eyes on the body: Immediately after his death, Columbus was buried Valladolid, the town in which he spent his last days. Then, on the wishes of his son Diego, the body was moved to Seville. Meanwhile, Diego headed back to the Dominican Republic to begin construction of a cathedral to hold his father’s remains, in accordance with his final wishes. Unfortunately, Diego died in 1526 before he could make that happen, and he was, in turn, interred in Seville next to his father. Both Columbuses stayed there for another 16 years, but when the Cathedral of Santa Maria was completed in the Dominican Republic, Diego’s widow put the wheels in motion to have both bodies moved there. In 1542 the remains sailed the ocean blue again, and joined the body of Christopher’s brother, Bartholomew, who had died in Santo Domingo the year before. There they remained for more than 200 years, but when the Spanish were ousted from the Dominican Republic in 1795, they took the explorer’s body with them to the other Spanish stronghold in the Caribbean: Havana, Cuba. Back in the Dominican Republic, nearly a century late a construction worker working on the cathedral renovation uncovered a lead box - unimpressive, save for the inscription on the inside of the lid: “The illustrious and excellent man, Don Colon, Admiral of the Ocean Sea.” At first pass, it seemed obvious that the Spanish must have, in their haste, taken the wrong box. But there’s a catch - both father, Christopher, and son, Diego, were known as “Don Colon” in their lifetimes, and both held the same title “Admiral of the Ocean Sea”. By 1898, when the Spanish were pushed out of Cuba by the Americans, both the Spaniards and Dominicans had decided firmly that the remains in their own possession were the authentic item, and that the other must be holding onto the son. Therefore, in Seville an elaborate cathedral tomb was prepared for the explorer’s return to his homeland, while in his adopted home another “official” tomb was planned. It took the Dominicans somewhat longer to get their design act together. It was not until 1931 that a design competition was held, won by a Scottish architect who proposed the 688 foot long cruciform memorial complex that now stands. The building was barely ready by the 1992 500th anniversary of Columbus’ arrival, when the remains were finally interred. In 2003, the controversy was tackled by DNA science, and the remains in Seville tested against known remains of Columbus’ brother Diego and son Fernando. Although promising, the results are not conclusive, and thus far, the remains interred at the lighthouse in Santo Domingo Este have not been tested, so for now, the mystery endures.",christopher columbus dead explorers catacombs catacombs and crypts cemeteries
58,Ruins of San Nicolás de Bari Hospital,"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic",The first hospital in the New World.,https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruins-hospital-st-nicolas-of-bari,"A place of mercy built under a reign of terror, what many consider to be the first hospital of the Americas was constructed in 1503-1508 by order of Nicolas de Ovando, Spanish soldier, knight, and Governor of the Indies. Only a few years had passed since Columbus was removed from governorship of the island in chains, accused of gross abuses of power. Columbus was replaced by Francisco de Bobadilla, who was replaced just a few years later by Ovando. Ovando arrived in Hispanola (now the Dominican Republic) from Spain with 2,500 colonists, including a young Francisco Pizarro, not yet a conquistador. The colony also included the Dominican priest Bartolomé de las Casas who would go on to write about the plight of the natives and African slaves to be amongst the first human rights activists of the new world. Although this first hospital was founded under his rule, Ovando was no gentle ruler. He is remembered for his ruthless and violent suppression of native uprisings, and for forcing those who survived into a kind of indentured servitude. After his eventual return to Spain, he was replaced by Columbus’ son Diego, whose home, the Alcazar de Colon, still stands nearby in Santo Domingo. The hospital is named for the famous Saint Nicholas of Bari, Italy whose tomb emits a holy ooze that has been regarded as a cure-all for centuries. Over its 350 years of operation it has been attacked by pirates, acted as a military hospital, and witnessed revolution. It finally succumbed to a combination of old age and earthquake damage, with much of the structure torn down in 1911 to reduce the risk of collapse.

The village was founded in 1976 after an executive from Paramount Pictures learned of a road in the area that had to be forged through a portion of a mountain. His idea was to use the leftover stones from the demolition of the mountain to recreate an entire village that would celebrate the artisans of the Dominican Republic. It took six years to be completed but thanks to the efforts of a small army of regional artisans, the village was handcrafted using era-appropriate techniques including woodworking and stone-cutting, to make it as authentic as possible. The jewels of the village include a scenic historic church and a wide stone amphitheater that can seat around 5,000 visitors. There is also an art school located in the hilltop village devoted to making sure a new era of artists and artisans will continue to come out of the area. Despite being a completely fabricated village, the authentic artistry on display in the verdant settlement makes stepping into Altos de Chavron like stepping back into medieval times.

La Isabela was established on the northern coast of Hispanola in 1494 by Christopher Columbus and 1500 colonists. By 1498, it was abandoned. Archaeological investigations led by a team from the Florida Museum of Natural History between 1989 -1999, revealed most of what we know about this early town. Returning on his second voyage, Columbus arrived at the site of La Isabela with 17 ships loaded with settlers, livestock, and materials for building and trade with the local Taino Indians. A sturdy town wall and stone buildings were complimented by 200 palm thatch huts, not unlike those of the natives, for living quarters. It was not technically the first buildings by Columbus - in 1492 on his first voyage, he built a small fort at Concepción de la Vega which was surrounded by a small settlement. Years later, when gold was discovered there Concepción became America’s first gold boomtown. But La Isabela was intended to be a city, not a fortress. But much like Jamestown and Roanoke to come, settling in the Americas proved much harder than imagined. The rough weather, crop failures, and hurricanes on the coast drove the settlers away from La Isabela in just four years, moving instead to Santo Domingo.

The El Carnaval de la Vega dates back to the time when the first European settlers arrived in the 1500s. Beginning as a religious activity to celebrate the time just before Lent, El Carnaval de la Vega’s theme revolved around the victory of good over evil. In recent years this festival has evolved to include the celebration of Dominican independence, which falls on February 27 every year. During the entire month of February, carnivals are celebrated on weekends and have spread to include most provinces, but El Carnaval de la Vega remains the biggest of them all. For El Carnaval de la Vega, all the stops are pulled: Music, costumes, food, drinks, and more all add up to a colorful and vibrant celebration of the island’s traditions and folklore. Some of the activities that take place during the festival include a choosing of Miss Carnaval Vegano in a pageant; the crowning of the king of the festival; an opening parade; a concert every Sunday with popular singers; and a closing parade. La Vega, where the festival is held, is the largest city and municipality of the central Dominican Republic and the third largest of the whole country. The area was settled by Europeans when Christopher Columbus built a small fort near what is today the city in 1494. Intended to guard the route that interior gold deposits were carried along on their way out of the country, the fort was managed by keepers who eventually allowed a Spanish settlement to grow around it. In 1562, the town was destroyed and completely buried by an earthquake.",carnival wondrous performances festivals rites and rituals

Almost cartoonish in his self-aggrandizing, sadistic villainy, Trujillo, known as “El Chivo,” spent 31 years ruling with an iron fist, seizing whatever property he liked, building lavish homes, funnelling the country’s wealth to family and friends, violating young women at will, and commissioning massive monuments to his own greatness. Along the way, he systematically eliminated any opposition to his regime, filling the cemeteries of the Dominican Republic with more than 50,000 of his own people. He controlled the Dominican Republic from 1930 up to his assassination in 1961, and although he was far from the only dictator in Latin America at the time, his ruthless command put his contemporaries to shame.

On February 12, 1546, Pope Paul III granted the status of Metropolitan Cathedral and Primate of the Indies on the site. It has since been the only Archdiocese to have held this title. The Cathedral of St. Mary of the Incarnation in Santo Domingo, dedicated to St. Mary of the Incarnation, contains a vast treasury of art constituted in paintings (including a panel of the Virgin of Altagracia dating back to 1523), old woodwork, furniture, monuments, and tombstones, among other things. The treasures that stand out the most are the mausoleums of the archbishops of the colonial period. For a time, this cathedral housed the remains of Christopher Columbus. Located between Calle Arzobispo Merino and Isabel la Católica, next to Columbus Park in the city of Santo Domingo de Guzman, the cathedral is fronted by a golden-tinted coral limestone facade. The church combines elements of both Gothic and Baroque with some lavish styles as exemplified by the high altar chiseled out of silver. The first noticeable feature of the structure are the solid limestone walls and three doors, two of which are Gothic and the third main door which is plateresque.

Built as a defense against native rebellions as well as foreign invasions, the fortress has been resilient to time, having outlasted numerous nations and governments who have used it as a symbol of their ultimate authority. Built in 1502, Fortaleza Ozama, named after nearby Ozama River, is considered to be the oldest fortress of European design in the New World. Spanish colonizers used Taino and African enslaved people to build the fortress using local coral stone. The walls are almost 10 feet (three meters) thick, making the fortress nearly impervious. In addition to being a military base, the fortress was home to the viceroys of Santo Domingo. The most well-known of these viceroys was Christopher Columbus who, along with his family, lived in Fortaleza Ozama during his tenuous reign. So corrupt and tyrannical was Columbus that even the imperial Spanish government judged him unfit to govern and had him jailed in the very fortress he called home. After he was dismissed, Columbus never returned to the building. The tumultuous history of the island would see the fortress exchanged between various countries including England, France, Haiti, the former Gran Colombia, and the United States. It proved to be so well-constructed that it was still used as a prison well into the 20th century. During the draconian rule of dictator Rafael Trujillo, Fortaleza Ozama was where countless political prisoners were detained and tortured. After much-needed national reforms, Fortaleza Ozama closed as a prison in the late ’60s. No longer a symbol of oppression and war, it is now a national landmark where visitors can enjoy the splendor of the island.

One of the few pre-Columbian monuments that exist in the Dominican Republic, it is located roughly 5 km. north of the City of San Juan de la Maguana, near the center of the island of Hispaniola (divided between this country and Haiti). It is among the most important pre-Columbian monuments of the Antilles. The site is composed of a circular clearing some 235 meters diameter, with a 1.50 meter long gray stone with a face carved on one end in the center. Though research on the site is somewhat scant, it is said that the site originally had two rows of black stones forming two concentric circles around the center which were destroyed by an irrigation district manager or builder, for the hydraulic works in the Canal Juan de Herrera. The site was further damaged in 1918 when Americans, during their invasion of the country, laid the center stone upright. Between the years of 1960 and 1965, restoration work was done by Emil Moya Boyra, returning the center stone to its original condition where it remains today. It is believed the site was a ceremonial place for the Caonabo and Anacaona Indians as well as a astronomical instrument.
